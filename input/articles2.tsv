While hippocampal and cortical mechanisms of memory consolidation have long been studied, their interaction is poorly understood. We sought to investigate potential interactions with respect to trace dominance, strengthening, and interference associated with postencoding novelty or sleep. A learning procedure was scheduled in a watermaze that placed the impact of novelty and sleep in opposition. Distinct behavioural manipulations—context preexposure or interference during memory retrieval—differentially affected trace dominance and trace survival, respectively. Analysis of immediate early gene expression revealed parallel up-regulation in the hippocampus and cortex, sustained in the hippocampus in association with novelty but in the cortex in association with sleep. These findings shed light on dynamically interacting mechanisms mediating the stabilization of hippocampal and neocortical memory traces. Hippocampal memory traces followed by novelty were more dominant by default but liable to interference, whereas sleep engaged a lasting stabilization of cortical traces and consequent trace dominance after preexposure.    Author Summary  Memories are initially stored in a hippocampal–cortical network; however, which brain area is important for long-term storage depends on what happens after learning. For example, replay of recent memories during sleep is thought to lead to consolidation in the cortex. In contrast, postlearning novelty is thought to strengthen hippocampal memory traces via a mechanism that depends on dopamine.  Here, we show that indeed sleep leads to cortical consolidation, whereas novelty leads to hippocampal consolidation. Further, the memories followed by sleep or novelty differed in their behavioural expression and in the factors that could influence them. Memory traces followed by novelty were more dominant by default and showed stronger expression than those followed by sleep. This came at a cost: these memories were susceptible to interference that decreased their behavioural expression. In contrast, memories followed by sleep were more resistant to interference and benefitted from preexposure to the training context.  In sum, we showed that events that follow learning can influence the future expression of a memory trace.    ERC https://erc.europa.eu/ (grant number NEUROSCHEMA - 268800). Received by GF and RGMM.

Traces subject to consolidation are retained, whereas later memory retrieval is unsuccessful when consolidation fails or is insufficient. Consolidation in both the hippocampus and neocortex is, however, now recognised as a complex set of processes involving both “cellular” mechanisms that operate largely within individual neurons and “systems” mechanisms that include network interactions across brain areas [ 1 – 4 ]. An additional mechanism called “reconsolidation” enables consolidated traces to be updated, indicating that stabilization need not imply fixation [ 5 – 7 ]. The distinction between cellular and systems consolidation is therefore not a sharp one, for the enactment of systems consolidation (involving interactions between hippocampus and neocortex) will necessarily involve the mechanisms of cellular consolidation as well. This overlap of mechanisms contributes to the challenge of studying of how hippocampal and cortical consolidation interact.  The overarching aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of hippocampal and cortical consolidation with respect to the retention of two potentially incompatible associations. Consider the following hypothetical situation. An experimental subject, be it human or an animal model, is required to learn first one thing and then later something different that may even contradict the first thing. In the procedural domain, it is important that the new skill overrides the first one and is then expressed in isolation (e.g., learning new balancing skills when riding a bicycle). However, in the episodic domain, it can be beneficial for the subject to remember both things even when they contradict one another (as in, “I used to think that John liked Mary but I now know it is only Mary that likes John”). This raises the conceptually deep issue of when new knowledge should interfere with and so “overwrite” earlier knowledge and when two items of ostensibly contradictory knowledge should both be retained.  Morris and Doyle [ 8 ] trained rats in a hippocampal-dependent watermaze task over many days to find a hidden escape platform in the northeast corner of the pool (in practice, this location was geometrically counterbalanced). Once this memory was well established, a “reversal” procedure was instituted such that, over eight trials, the platform was hidden in the opposite southwest corner. The key variable manipulated in the experiment was the interval of time between these eight trials (30 s or 24 h). In the 24-h condition, the animals learned the reversal and thereafter always searched for the platform in the southwest corner in successive memory tests over several weeks until the memory was lost. The animals also learned the reversal in the 30 s condition and first searched persistently in the southwest corner during an initial posttraining memory test, but, without any further training, they switched to searching preferentially in the northeast corner during a memory test conducted 12 d later. The amount of training on the reversal (eight trials) was exactly matched, but arguably the opportunity for engaging hippocampal (fast) and cortical (slow) consolidation mechanisms differed as a function of the short versus long intertrial intervals, respectively. In the former case, two incompatible traces were retained; in the latter, the first memory was overwritten.  The present study builds on this preliminary observation as a first step towards a systematic analysis of the intriguing issue of interference versus mutual retention. In the hippocampus, protein synthesis–dependent cellular consolidation acts soon after encoding as a selective filter to enable traces to be retained for longer [ 9 – 12 ], a process now known to be enhanced by postencoding novelty [ 13 ], possibly via a ventral tegmental area-hippocampal formation feedback loop [ 14 ]. Separately, cortical consolidation can occur (especially during overnight sleep) to guide and stabilize network interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex [ 15 – 22 ]. This likely operates using overlapping mechanisms (i.e., both cellular and systems mechanisms) but with the passage of sleep activating distinct neural mechanisms to enable either stable, episodic-like memory traces in the cortex, the potential loss of contextual associations, and/or the successful assimilation of new information with prior knowledge [ 23 – 27 ]. Cortical consolidation is widely thought to be a slower process [ 15 ], but there is growing evidence that it can sometimes be initiated soon after learning and act relatively quickly, such as during sleep [ 2 , 20 , 27 , 28 ].  We therefore sought to create two conflicting memory traces and then identify manipulations that would favour interference and loss or dominant behavioural expression of one contradictory memory without loss of the other. Postencoding novelty in the waking state or the opportunity for sleep soon after training were two distinct behavioural manipulations used to potentiate hippocampal or neocortical consolidation, respectively. These were supplemented by pretraining to assist assimilation with prior knowledge (cortical) or an interference protocol (likely to operate preferentially in the hippocampal domain).  One complication was that the novelty condition necessitated the simultaneous use of brief sleep deprivation to distinguish it from the sleep condition, and this necessitated an additional control study to check that brief sleep deprivation itself did not alter memory performance. Another unavoidable concern was that it is unlikely that novelty or sleep act exclusively on the hippocampus or cortex, respectively. Nonetheless, while less clear-cut than would be optimal, there are grounds for believing that postencoding novelty will have a preferential impact in the hippocampus [ 13 , 29 ], whereas sleep has a preferential impact on the interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex [ 16 , 17 ]. In the context of our experimental design, we can think of the two competing memory traces as occupying each side of a children’s “seesaw.” The relative dominance of one or the other trace is then “flipped” by changing behavioural parameters of training that likely affect hippocampal and cortical consolidation preferentially [ 30 ].  These manipulations being behavioural, it was incumbent upon us to identify whether potential neural markers of consolidation, such as immediate early gene (IEG) expression, were activated differentially at these two relevant anatomical sites. Our aim here was not to compare detailed patterns of expression across hippocampal subregions or cortical brain regions, nor to conduct a comprehensive comparison of expression patterns as a function of time [ 31 ], but rather to secure preliminary measures of the impact of these manipulations in the hippocampus and a specific region of the cortex. We predicted that novelty would lead to a learning-independent increase in immediate early gene (IEG) mRNA expression in the hippocampus related to the production of plasticity-related proteins implicated in synaptic tagging and capture [ 32 ] and the consequent consolidation of hippocampal traces [ 29 ]. In contrast, sleep should trigger a relatively selective increase in cortical consolidation after learning but against the background of a time-dependent down-regulation of IEG expression unrelated to memory consolidation, resembling findings recently reported for firing-rate changes [ 16 , 17 , 33 – 35 ].    Results  In separate experiments, rats ( n = 337) were randomly assigned for training in a spatial memory task, with brain tissue from a subset of animals analysed (blind) with respect to the expression of IEGs. An initial cohort ( n = 32) was given brief spatial learning (four blocks of two trials per block) in a watermaze to one escape location, followed—after 7.5 h—by equivalent training to an opposite location ( Fig 1A ). These two sessions of training deliberately set up two competing memories such that memory tested much later could of be of one memory, the other, or of both. The animals learned each location in a comparable manner across the two training sessions within a day ( Fig 1B ) and showed, during a memory test 7 d later, significantly above chance swim time in predefined zones centred on the two platform locations (t = 2.45, df 26, p = 0.022; Fig 1C ). While there was a trend favouring the more recently trained location, there was no significant difference in acquisition of memory associated with the two sessions ( p > 0.7; Fig 1C ).   10.1371/journal.pbio.2000531.g001  Fig 1   A watermaze protocol to examine competition of two memory traces.  (A) Rats learned two opposite hidden platform locations in a watermaze over two successive sessions (four blocks of two trials per block, separated by 7.5 h) with a probe trial (no platform) conducted 7 d later. (B) Over both sessions, the animals decreased their escape latency (F = 21.5, df 1.7/51, p < 0.001). (C) At the 7 d memory test, the animals swam on average above chance level across zones (striped bar; t = 2.45, df 26, p = 0.022), but the trend favouring recency was not significant ( p > 0.7). (D) Each session was followed by either sleep or novelty + sleep deprivation (N + SD) in a counterbalanced design. (E) Example swim path at test, with platform location followed by sleep NW (black zone) and N + SD SE (white zone) and starting location NE (green arrow). Note: based on extensive observation of swim patterns in the watermaze, the zones were deliberately designed to include an area by the side walls adjacent to one or other platform. (F) Swim time in zone followed by N + SD dominates over that followed by sleep (t = 1.97, df 52, p = 0.054, Cohen’s d = 0.54, N + SD to chance t = 2.31, df 26, p = 0.03). N + SD = novelty with sleep deprivation, NW = northwest, SE = southeast, * p < 0.05 t -test to chance. Means +/- 1 standard error of the mean (SEM). All raw data available in S1 Data .     Two conditions, (1) sleep and (2) novelty + sleep deprivation (N + SD), were scheduled in a counterbalanced and within-subjects manner after the first and second (competing) sessions of spatial learning. In the N + SD condition, the animals were placed in a novel environment with the repeated presentation of novel objects and other items and repeated gentle handling to prevent the animals from going to sleep. To control that the effects seen here were due to novelty and not sleep deprivation, we repeated the experiments but only with sleep deprivation by gentle handling and excluded novelty (see S11 Fig ). We used a doubly counterbalanced design (with respect to both the order of platform location and of the N + SD versus sleep conditions; Fig 1D ; S1 Fig ). Accumulating data across animals and conditions required us to “rotate” the data matrix of half of the datasets by 180° for averaging, statistical, and graphical purposes. The swim paths in the 7 d probe test (memory retrieval) showed swim paths that moved back and forth between the two trained locations but revealed preferential search in the trained location that was followed by N + SD (representative animal in Fig 1E ). The time searching in a virtual zone around the escape location was above chance for the N + SD condition but did not differ from chance in the sleep condition (N + SD t = 2.31, df 26, p = 0.03; sleep t = –0.13, df 26, p > 0.8, Fig 1F , separated for sequence [see S8 Fig ]). Thus, under “baseline” conditions, and despite the opportunity for 6 further days of the animals’ routine sleep/waking cycle in the absence of further training, weak spatial learning followed by conditions favouring cellular consolidation in the hippocampus dominates the expression of memory in behaviour.  We then examined two further cohorts ( n = 32 in each) in which we sought to flip the “seesaw” in one direction or the other. Experiment 1 can be thought of as having established a “default” situation in which the competing memory trace followed by N + SD is dominant over the memory trace followed by sleep ( Fig 2A , Base condition). One behavioural method of flipping the seesaw was extensive preexposure of the animals to the context. Context preexposure would create prior knowledge of the extramaze cues of later watermaze learning and, we predicted, should enhance the speed and effectiveness of its cortical consolidation with relatively little effect on the trace, followed by N + SD ( Fig 2A Pre-E). Context preexposure consisted of 3 d of 8 min exploration of the training context, achieved by placing the animals on a solid floor located within the watermaze (without water, but at the same height as the water would normally be, and with all extramaze cues visible). This allowed the animals to explore the environment and should have enabled them to learn about the relative location of extramaze cues. Subsequent training in the watermaze might then trigger learning in which the location of the hidden platform is rapidly assimilated within a previously established context representation. Specifically, we predicted “fast” systems consolidation [ 36 ], in much the same manner as can happen when animals have previously learned schematic knowledge [ 27 ].   10.1371/journal.pbio.2000531.g002  Fig 2   Distinct protocols favour cellular or systems consolidation.  (A) The experimental design was, metaphorically, like a children’s seesaw. In addition to the baseline experiment ( Fig 1 ), a further group was preexposed to the watermaze extramaze cues with a dry-land inlay for 3 d prior to the experiment (Pre-E) and a third group to an interference trial 24 h after training (Int). Sleep and N + SD followed in a counterbalanced manner. The “dominant” trace is the lightest, rising above the other conflicting trace. (B) In the zone analysis, a group x condition interaction was seen (F = 3.3, df 2/82, p = 0.043, with post hoc linear contrast p < 0.05, both controlling for sequence of consolidation-type, d = 3.37 * p = 0.03, p = 0.025 and ** p = 0.01 t -test to chance). (C) Spatial dwell time maps of the watermaze at 7 d test with warm colours indicating higher average dwell time. Note systematic shift of the “hot” area across the different group protocols. Example paths from individual animals are shown in S18 Fig . (D) The cluster analysis showed two clusters in the baseline and preexposure groups but only one cluster in the interference group. Red cross indicates platform position, grey cross indicates cluster centre. Each point represents a local maxima derived from the dwell time maps. For panels C and D, the location followed by sleep is graphically presented at NW (black) and followed by N + SD at SE (white) but was counterbalanced. (E) Shows the number of animals that had above 20% swim time in the zone surrounding the platform location for each condition and experiment. Only in Int was a significant effect seen, with more sleep animals being above and more N + SD animals below chance level (Fisher’s exact test p = 0.019). (F) To ensure a specific effect of novelty, we ran two further cohorts ( n = 32 in each) repeating the Base and Int experiments but this time with sleep deprivation by gentle handling instead of novelty (SD). There was a significant novelty x experiment x condition interaction (F = 3.7, df 1/116, p = 0.033). N + SD = novelty with sleep deprivation, NW = northwest, SE = southeast, Means +/- 1 SEM; all raw data available in S1 Data .     The other method of influencing trace dominance was interference by removing access to the hidden platform during a test of memory 24 h after training. This involved a 120 s swim trial in the watermaze with no platform present, a procedure that would be likely to have the greatest effect on the “dominant” trace [ 30 ]. The consequences of such additional postacquisition learning should serve to diminish the capacity of the earlier trained N + SD trace to dominate the sleep memory with which it is competing ( Fig 2A Int) and might even alter permanently the hippocampal representation of where escape may be possible.  The results confirmed these predictions ( Fig 2B ). Context preexposure enhanced performance after watermaze training to a level at which postencoding sleep enabled rapid assimilation of new information about the escape location during the four blocks of swim trials ( Fig 2B ). Conversely, postlearning interference had a greater impact on information that had been subject to strengthening by the prior N + SD condition ( Fig 2B ). Analysis of all three conditions—baseline, pre-exposure and interference—revealed a significant conditions x consolidation type interaction (F = 3.2, df 2/83, p = 0.043, d = 3.37 controlling for sequence of consolidation type).  This statistical interaction justified deeper analyses of the data—specifically, to compare the impact of masking (through trace dominance) and erasure (through interference or new learning). From both the baseline study and the additional experiments, we derived “dwell time” (heat) maps ( Fig 2C ) and a related but statistically distinct “cluster analysis” ( Fig 2D ). Dwell time maps show a summated occupancy of locations across the pool, with the “hot” colours reflecting greatest time. The cluster analysis, in contrast, identifies local maxima of occupancy even when these occur at levels well below the absolute maximum, signified by the hottest colour in the dwell time map. Using a gap-statistic method [ 37 ], the optimal number of clusters of occupancy could be calculated from the spread of all identified local maxima locations (see Methods ). The cluster analysis is important as it has the potential to reveal the existence of a spatial memory (a focused cluster) even in circumstances in which its behavioural expression is masked by a separate dominant memory; similarly, it can reveal its absence. For graphical purposes, the sleep condition is displayed as northwest while the N + SD condition is shown as southeast (but this was fully counterbalanced, S1 Fig ). For the baseline condition, the dwell time map ( Fig 2C left) showed most searching in the N + SD location, complementing the previous zone-analysis, but the cluster-analysis ( Fig 2D left) revealed memory for two separate locations. This indicated that the dominant behavioural expression of the memory consolidated by posttraining N + SD only masked the other memory with which it was in direct competition with respect to the control of behaviour. The presence of a significant negative correlation between swim time in the respective zones for N + SD and sleep offers further evidence for memory competition rather than erasure ( S9 Fig ). The preexposure condition revealed a more symmetrically balanced heat map and detectable clusters at or near both escape platform locations ( Fig 2C and 2D , middle). In contrast, giving the animals 24 h interference trial, in which they could learn that neither platform was available, reduced the intensity of “hot” colours in the dwell time map and resulted in a complete loss of any clustering around the platform location followed by N + SD ( Fig 2C and 2D , right). In this case, however, there are grounds for suspecting a loss of the N + SD location rather than masking because the cluster analysis identifies only one cluster centred on the sleep location with no local maxima for the N + SD being detectable. Our manipulations have had differential effects.  The distinction between “masking” and “erasure” is subtle but important. To further substantiate this putative dissociation, a third analysis was performed based on the swim time in the zones surrounding the platform locations ( Fig 2E ). For each experiment and group, we divided the animals into good performers above 20% swim time in zone and poor performers below it. The number of good and poor performers did not differ between the sleep and N + SD conditions for the Base and Pre-E experiment. In contrast, after interference, significantly more good performers were present in the sleep condition, and more poor performers were present in the N + SD condition (Fisher’s exact test p = 0.019). This supports the idea that the masking of memory traces takes place in the baseline experiment, but when the opportunity is given to learn that no escape is possible, memory erasure can both occur and occur selectively.  N + SD animals were placed in a novel environment and subjected to the repeated presentation of novel objects and items, coupled with gentle handling to prevent them going to sleep. To check whether the effects of N + SD were due to novelty, rather than sleep deprivation, two further cohorts ( n = 32 in each) were run that repeated the Base and Int experiments but with sleep deprivation by gentle handling and explicitly excluding novelty (see Fig 2F and S11 Fig ). In contrast to the N + SD experiments, sleep deprivation by gentle handling did not lead to the interaction effects seen across experiments and conditions. In fact, when compared with the main experimental condition, there was a significant novelty (N + SD/SD) x experiment (Base/Int) x condition (sleep/sleep deprivation) interaction (F = 3.7, df 1/116, p = 0.033).  The next important step was to complement these behavioural observations with measures of likely markers of consolidation, namely immediate early genes. If the account we have offered so far in terms of differential impact of hippocampal versus cortical consolidation is valid, there should be analogous changes at the IEG level following these same manipulations. We therefore sought to observe the impact of N + SD and sleep on genes likely relevant to neuronal plasticity. We focused on selected markers to represent activity-related and plasticity-related processes: immediate early gene expression of cFos mRNA as an indicator of activity [ 38 ] and Zif-268 and Arc mRNA as an indicator of plasticity [ 1 ]. These were all monitored in both the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).  There were two key decisions about the experimental design. First, the experimental method involved in measuring mRNA expression in association with memory encoding and consolidation was real-time quantitative PCR analysis. We chose qPCR in contrast to immunocytochemistry as we sought to achieve an exact and quantitative measure of the extent and time course of gene transcription. This enabled more complex statistical models with multiple within- and between-subject comparisons at the cost of being unable to compare and contrast different subregions within the hippocampus or areas of the cortex. Second, behavioural training was necessarily to a single escape location in the watermaze because the “trace-competition” design could not be used unambiguously. Additionally, it was important to measure IEG activation at defined time points soon after encoding, and this also precluded the use of training to two escape platforms several hours apart. The consolidation-specific effects of the two conditions (sleep and N + SD) were investigated as well as general effects of the condition. To achieve this aim, specific contrasts in our analysis were chosen. For consolidation-specific effects, the contrast was between animals that did or did not experience the watermaze, but we controlled for their condition with both groups having either sleep or N + SD ( Fig 3 ). In contrast, for general condition effects, the contrast was between animals that experienced the watermaze (and had either sleep or N + SD) with awake, home cage control animals ( Fig 4 ).   10.1371/journal.pbio.2000531.g003  Fig 3   RT-qPCR analysis consolidation.  (A) To elucidate learning specific effects, we directly compared animals 0.5 h and 5 h after having a learning session in the watermaze (WM) or remaining in the home cage (no exposure to the watermaze [NoWM]) with either sleep or N + SD in the 5 h period. Positive values reflect higher gene expression in WM animals, and negative values reflect higher gene expression in NoWM. At encoding (0.5 h), a significant gene effect was seen, with cFos showing higher gene expression changes than both other genes across both brain areas (F = 19.8, df 1.1/6.6, p = 0.01, post hoc simple, contrasts cFos versus Arc F = 10.3, df 1/4, p = 0.033 and cFos versus Zif F = 56.5, df 1/4, p = 0.002). 5 h later (Sleep and N + SD), a significant brain area x condition interaction was seen (F = 6.9, df 1/24, p = 0.015, post hoc linear contrast p = 0.015), with WM showing higher gene expression than NoWM in the HPC after N + SD, but lower in sleep. Thus, time (0.5 and 5 h) showed a differential effect across brain areas and condition (B and C). (B) In the hippocampus, only sleep and not N + SD showed a significant decrease in gene expression from 0.5 to 5 h (Sleep: F = 12.2, df 1/8, p = 0.008, d = 2.48; N + SD: F = 1.6, df 1/8, p > 0.2, d = 0.90). (C) In contrast, in the mPFC, the opposite pattern was seen, with a significant decrease in gene expression only in N + SD (sleep: F = 0.3, df 1/8, p > 0.5, d = 0.42; N + SD: F = 5.6, df 1/8, p = 0.046, d = 1.67). HPC = hippocampus, mPFC = medial prefrontal cortex, IEG = immediate early gene, N + SD = novelty with sleep deprivation. Means +/- 1 SEM. All raw data available in S1 Data .      10.1371/journal.pbio.2000531.g004  Fig 4   RT-qPCR analysis conditions.  (A) Left: Rats learned one platform location in the watermaze followed by either sleep or N + SD. The animals were humanely killed (arrows) at different time points throughout the procedure, capturing consolidation steps across the two conditions (Con) to allow for qPCR analysis of IEG expression in the mPFC and HPC. Right: To exclude learning-specific effects, we directly compared animals at 5 h after having a learning session in the watermaze (WM) or remaining in the home cage (NoWM) with either sleep or N + SD in the 5 h period. All animals are compared to home cage controls (HCC). (B) In comparison to a neutral wake condition (HCC), N + SD showed elevated gene expression that was sustained throughout the N + SD period in HPC (yellow background). In contrast, sleep showed a decrease. There was both a condition x brain area and condition x time interaction seen during the consolidation period (F = 13.1, df 1/24, p = 0.001 with post hoc linear contrast p < 0.001; F = 6.1, df 2/24, p = 0.007, respectively). These effects were seen independent from any experiences in the watermaze (right). (C) In the mPFC, sleep was associated with a decrease in IEG, which was monotonic with respect to time in the mPFC (grey background; 2, 4, and 6 h from left to right). In contrast, N + SD showed an up-regulation of expression. And again, these effects were seen independent from any experiences in the watermaze (right). HPC = hippocampus, mPFC = medial prefrontal cortex, IEG = immediate early gene, N + SD = novelty with sleep deprivation, HCC = home cage controls. Means +/- 1 SEM. All raw data available in S1 Data .     The study design focused on comparing IEG expression during the course of the respective postencoding N + SD or sleep manipulations in brain tissue from animals that had all learned the watermaze in a single session with tissue from animals that had not been subject to training ( Fig 3 ). For all experiments, the brains were extracted with the hippocampus (HPC) (yellow) and mPFC (grey) immediately dissected and then snap-frozen for later analysis ( Fig 3A ). We compared brain tissue from animals that had experienced a learning session in the watermaze (WM) with animals that did not (NoWM; Fig 3B and 3C ). This was done either directly after encoding (0.5 h) or 5 h into the consolidation period in association with postencoding sleep or N + SD ( n = 30). The graphs are plotted such that positive values indicate higher gene expression in WM than in NoWM (negative values, vice versa). We chose a neutral wake control condition (NoWM) because possible alternative control conditions such as swimming in the watermaze without a platform can display alterations in IEG expression in association with stress or with incidental learning about the environment through exploration [ 39 – 41 ], and these confounding factors can hinder interpretation of results [ 42 ]. Furthermore, for present purposes, the critical results are the contrasts between N + SD and sleep with respect to spatial learning or its absence.  For the 0.5 h encoding condition, without subsequent behavioural manipulations, there was a significant and equivalent increase gene expression in both the HPC and mPFC relative to NoWM ( Fig 3B and 3C , left). There was a significantly larger increase in cFos compared to the plasticity-associated genes (F = 19.8, df 1.1/6.6, p = 0.01, post hoc simple, contrasts cFos versus Arc F = 10.3, df 1/4, p = 0.033 and cFos versus Zif F = 56.5, df 1/4, p = 0.002). This is an important finding, as it points to substantial and rapid gene up-regulation in both brain regions at or soon after learning.  The comparison of WM and NoWM after 5 h of N + SD or sleep revealed different patterns of gene expression in hippocampus versus cortex ( Fig 3B and 3C , right). In the hippocampus, the pattern was for higher gene expression with WM after N + SD and lower after sleep; in the cortex, the opposite pattern prevailed. The ANOVA showed a significant brain area x condition interaction at the 5 h time point (F = 6.9, df 1/24, p = 0.015, post hoc linear contrast p = 0.015). This interaction is important and most easily illustrated by focusing on the effect of time (0.5 and 5 h) on cFos . Note that the relative level of gene expression in HPC after 5 h of N + SD (at approximately 20% greater for the animals had been trained) was not significantly less than that observed at 0.5 h (t = 2.0, df = 8, p > 0.08); a much larger and now significant decrease in relative gene expression over time was observed for sleep with gene expression being approximately 35% less in animals that had been trained (t = 4.0, df = 8, p = 0.004; Fig 3B ). In contrast, if one looks at the relative impact of N + SD and sleep in cortex, the decrease in relative cFos expression across training conditions from +120% to –60% for N + SD was significant (t = 3.1, df = 8, p = 0.015), whereas for sleep the corresponding difference did not reach significance (t = 1.1, df = 8, p > 0.3; Fig 3C ). The same pattern was also seen across all genes (HPC: sleep: F = 12.2, df 1/8, p = 0.008, d = 2.48; N + SD: F = 1.6, df 1/8, p > 0.2, d = 0.90; mPFC: sleep: F = 0.3, df 1/8, p > 0.5, d = 0.42; N + SD: F = 5.6, df 1/8, p = 0.046, d = 1.67).  The differential effects of N + SD and sleep on gene expression, offset by consolidation-associated changes, warranted further study into the more general effects of N + SD and sleep. Specifically, in a separate cohort of 35 animals, IEG expression was measured in hippocampus (yellow) or prefrontal cortex (grey) at 2 h, 4 h, or 6 h after encoding ( Fig 4A ), during which postencoding N + SD (white) or sleep (black) were occurring in different subgroups of animals (conditions). This time, these were referenced to a neutral, awake home cage control (HCC) to enable comparison of the general change in gene expression across both behaviours ( n = 5 for each “con” subgroup and n = 5 for the “HCC” control). In the separate cohort of trained and untrained animals ( n = 25), the time-point 5 h was examined only.  Animals allowed to sleep for varying time periods showed a monotonic, time-dependent decrease in gene expression relative to HCCs at the neocortical but not the hippocampal site (for an explanation of the “fold-change” measure, see Methods RT-qPCR). In contrast, the impact of recurring exposure to novelty coupled to sleep deprivation was associated with positive changes in gene expression in both brain regions that did not change over time. An overall ANOVA of gene expression—including condition (Sleep, N + SD), time (2, 4, and 6 h), brain area (HPC, mPFC), and gene ( cFos , Zif-268 and Arc )—revealed significant interactions for condition x time and condition x brain area (F = 13.1, df 1/24, p = 0.001 with post hoc linear contrast p < 0.001; F = 6.1, df 2/24, p = 0.007, respectively). The same general pattern was seen for all genes, but Arc expression drove the result in the cortex as indicated by a significant condition x time x brain area x gene interaction. Ongoing novelty for 2, 4, or 6 h was associated with an apparently stable up-regulation of IEG expression with no relevant interactions.  In an additional control analysis, we also compared the 5 h WM/NoWM and sleep/N + SD conditions to a neutral wake home cage control and could replicate the general decrease in gene expression in sleep and increase in N + SD, which was thus shown to be learning independent and mainly reflected the current experience (sleep or novelty) of the animal ( Fig 4 right).    Discussion  The overarching aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of hippocampal and cortical consolidation with respect to the retention of two potentially incompatible associations. The key findings are that (1) rats can learn and retain two incompatible spatial memories without interference, with one memory dominating expression in certain circumstances; (2) postencoding sleep or novelty plus sleep deprivation have differential effects on memory consolidation and the resulting pattern of behavioural expression; this differential effect is genuinely because of sleep versus novelty, as a brief period of sleep deprivation alone was shown to have minimal effects on memory consolidation; and (3) novelty and sleep are associated with differential patterns of up-regulation of immediate early genes in the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. We shall argue that these findings support the idea that the stabilization of memory traces within cell assemblies reflects a time-overlapping interaction of two interdependent processes—hippocampal and cortical consolidation.   Hippocampal and Cortical Memory Consolidation  We begin by clarifying the distinction between hippocampal versus cortical consolidation on the one hand and cellular versus systems consolidation on the other. Cellular consolidation was initially identified by monitoring the impact of inhibitors of protein synthesis soon after training [ 43 ], with many later studies focusing on its expression in the hippocampus. Interestingly, consolidation within the hippocampus has been shown to be enhanced by postencoding novelty [ 13 ]. In contrast, systems consolidation was initially identified using perturbing interventions such as lesions via the phenomenon of retrograde amnesia [ 44 ], with more recent evidence indicating that this process may occur primarily during sleep [ 2 ]. Cortical consolidation likely involves both systems consolidation (interactions with the hippocampus) and cellular consolidation (stabilising synaptic changes within cortical networks). The hippocampal and cortical processes are generally held to act in sequence, with the hippocampal process setting the stage for the hippocampal–neocortical interactions that follow [ 26 ]. However, an alternative possibility supported by our data is that these two processes can occur in parallel and interact dynamically using both cellular and systems mechanisms, even if their respective time courses are not fully overlapping.  The novel approach here was to search for interactions between hippocampal and cortical consolidation in situations in which one or another competing memory trace might be rendered more dominant. This approach utilises the important concept of “dominance of the trace,” derived from studies of reconsolidation [ 30 ], which is particularly pertinent in situations involving potentially incompatible memory traces. With respect to the observations of Morris and Doyle [ 8 ], we can see that reversal training across days would have maximally enhanced cortical consolidation and lasting stabilisation, whereas within-day training would have enhanced a hippocampal trace with only minimal impact on cortical consolidation. The latter conditions would have been permissive for the spontaneous reversal during memory retention that was observed.    Medial Prefrontal Cortex  One classic perspective on memory formation is that the hippocampus and cortex engage in “parallel encoding” [ 45 – 47 ] and that neocortical traces fade rapidly unless subject to a stabilisation signal from information retained within the hippocampus [ 48 ]. In contrast, the complementary learning systems theory initially suggested that rapid hippocampal encoding is sequentially followed by a slower neocortical “interleaving” process [ 26 ], a theory that has now been revised to recognise the possibility of “fast” consolidation [ 25 ]. The qPCR results showing similar up-regulation of IEGs in both structures within 30 min of memory encoding also support the “parallel encoding” concept, as they point to molecular events that are indirect markers of consolidation happening soon after memory encoding in both brain regions. IEG activation is triggered by memory encoding in both structures. Their interaction alters as a function of distinct behavioural manipulations such as postencoding novelty or sleep.  Others have proposed that the medial prefrontal cortex may not be a storage site for memory but, rather, responsible for memory integration and control [ 3 , 45 – 47 ]. Interestingly, the mPFC has to be active for reconsolidation to occur in the watermaze [ 48 ], and lesions in this area seem to especially affect memory retrieval under partial cueing conditions [ 49 , 50 ]. Here, sleep led to immediate early gene activation in the mPFC that, if the mPFC is for memory integration and behavioural control, could be associated with mPFC neural activity, leading to better integration of the two distinct experiences in the watermaze. This could explain our results in conditions with multiple experiences in the watermaze such as Pre-E and Int, in which the memory encoded prior to sleep was shown to dominate the control over behaviour. Interestingly, the opposite was the case in the Base condition, in which N + SD had the dominant control of behaviour. Independent of if the prefrontal cortex is the actual storage site or facilitates memory integration and control, in our case, plasticity processes occur in this region after learning and, more importantly, after sleep.    Novelty  N + SD led to increased IEG expression in the hippocampus. According to the synaptic-tagging and capture- and clustered-plasticity models of consolidation [ 29 , 32 , 51 ], an increase of mRNA expression and translation caused by a novelty experience would enable newly synthesized, plasticity-related proteins to be captured by not only the initiating synapse (in this case, the one encoding the novel experience) but also by other synapses (in this case, the watermaze memory encoded 30 min earlier). The procedure we used of gentle handling of the animals and their frequent exposure to new objects in a novel environment likely sustained the relevant activation of protein synthesis over time, as evidenced by our IEG results showing sustained up-regulation over 6 h. Our interpretation is that these novelty-induced plasticity proteins would have triggered cellular consolidation of the watermaze memory in the hippocampus. This would have enabled the hippocampal trace to last long enough to be still present during a memory test conducted 24 h later in the case of our “Int” manipulation ( Fig 2 ). With this trace retained and “active” in the hippocampus over this duration, the opportunity for training-associated updating would have prevailed [ 52 ]. The memory test would have enabled the animals to alter their hippocampal trace to indicate the escape platform was no longer available. Importantly, the trace consolidated in the cortex by sleep (see below) would have been relatively unaffected.    Sleep  In contrast to novelty, the impact of sleep is that an initial learning-related up-regulation of relevant gene expression is sustained over time in the cortex ( Fig 3 ), but this is in the context of a learning-independent decrease that becomes larger with time ( Fig 4 ).  During sleep, activated synapses especially in the cortex are thought to be potentiated by intermittent replay events, putatively reflected in our sustained, learning-specific up-regulation of gene expression in the cortex [ 17 , 34 , 53 – 57 ]. However, sleep is also associated with a general time-dependent decrease in gene expression relative to home cage controls. Our study is the first to reveal extended time-dependent effects on IEG expression after longer periods of sleep, as earlier experiments have only investigated sleep for 1–2 h after learning [ 58 , 59 ]. This time-related decrease—possibly a “wash-out” of gene expression–related products—may be related to “downscaling” [ 34 , 60 ]. Downscaling is a type of cortical resetting process that is not yet well understood mechanistically [ 35 , 61 – 64 ]. The important idea is that within engram cells with potentiated synapses, synapses that are recently inactive are selectively downscaled, while the potentiated synapses of a new memory trace may be left intact [ 33 , 34 , 60 ].  In our case, downscaling was putatively reflected in the time-dependent decrease of gene expression that was learning independent. However, selectively after learning, a bimodality of cortical IEG expression was revealed as a sustained relative increase in gene expression during sleep, analogous to reported firing rate changes [ 35 ]. These bimodal changes are consistent with the concept of a selective strengthening of synapses involved in engrams—which most likely includes only a small percentage of neurons—and the general downscaling of all other synapses in mPFC during sleep, with a consequential enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio in the cortex as a signature of systems consolidation [ 16 , 17 ].    Flipping the Seesaw  Preexposure to the environment enhanced the effectiveness of systems consolidation during sleep; in contrast, behavioural interference (a memory test) acted directly on the memory trace that had been enhanced soon after encoding by novelty with the effect of erasing it. The impact of 3 d of context preexposure would likely have created a network-level representation of the training context in the neocortex (and possibly in the hippocampus in parallel [ 65 , 66 ]). With that prior knowledge on the part of the animals, brief training was shown to be sufficient for rapid assimilation of information about the location of the hidden platform into the existing cortical representation, analogous to what happens in formal studies of knowledge assimilation into schemas [ 27 , 67 ]. In support, our behavioural analyses began with the demonstration of two search zones in animals with context preexposure who were trained to visit both escape platform locations in the pool; the cluster analysis quantitatively confirmed the existence of two separate clusters of memory traces at these two escape locations. Thus, while we present no evidence on the occurrence of rapid hippocampal independency as seen in Tse et al. [ 27 ], we did show a behavioural effect of the preexposure with the selective strengthening of the memory trace that was followed by sleep. In contrast, in the case of behavioural interference, as discussed above, the memory test acted directly on the memory trace that had been enhanced soon after encoding by novelty with the effect of erasing it. Here, the other memory whose consolidation was augmented by sleep was now the only one detectable.    Potential Caveats  There are certain caveats to our approach. One is that the second session of learning in the watermaze might be thought to constitute “interference” trials for what was acquired in the first session of learning. Interestingly, our heat map and cluster analysis data establish that this did not occur. Instead, one or another trace “dominated” the control of behaviour, and the sequence in which they were learned had no statistically significant effect. Alterations to the stored memory representation of a hidden platform did occur when an interference test was conducted 24 h after training, but such a trial consisted of a long period of time swimming in the pool with multiple opportunities to learn that escape was no longer possible at a previously learned location. This new learning primarily affected what we suspect may be the hippocampal but not the cortical trace, but our data allows only that it was the memory trace that, in the original training the day before, was followed by novelty rather than by sleep. Second, dissociating a putative hippocampal and cortical trace is not straightforward; a complication is that spatial learning in the watermaze does not follow the usual temporal parameters of retrograde amnesia associated with posttraining hippocampal damage [ 68 – 70 ]. The reason is that the integrity of the hippocampus is required for the expression of spatial navigation. For example, “reminding” of a latent but inactive cortical spatial memory trace that is then expressed during a second retrieval trial requires the integrity of the hippocampus [ 68 ]. Accordingly, our group introduced an alternative way of investigating systems consolidation of watermaze learning in which the hippocampus functions normally at retrieval. Starting soon after training was completed, bilateral osmotic minipumps were used to infuse an AMPA receptor antagonist into the hippocampus for 7 d [ 71 ]. When the animals were tested 14 d after the end of training, the hippocampus was shown electrophysiologically to be working normally. Nonetheless, the impact of shutting down the hippocampus for 7 d was that spatial memory had been lost. On the basis of this and other earlier evidence [ 8 , 72 ], there are grounds for believing that the hippocampus and cortex interact normally for the consolidation of spatial learning in the watermaze. A third caveat concerns the possibility that the novelty manipulation has its effects because it is novelty and sleep deprivation. The procedural difficulty was that it is impossible to sustain a novelty manipulation for the same 6 h duration as the sleep manipulation we used without coupling it to sleep deprivation in order to ensure frequent access to novel stimuli. Further, because of the innate curiosity of the animals, novel stimuli act as natural agents of sleep deprivation. For this reason, we have throughout the results referred to our manipulation as “N + SD” and intend to investigate the potentially dissociable parameters of this protocol in future work. As an initial control experiment, we did repeat the interference experiment but this time with sleep deprivation by gentle handling but excluding novelty (see supplementary S11 Fig ). This did abolish the differential effect of interference on the two memory traces, further indicating that our findings were primarily due to the effect of novelty and not sleep deprivation. Fourth, we recognise that the behavioural protocol differed for the qPCR study than for the earlier parts of the study, but as explained above (see Results ), this was necessary for timing reasons and to avoid ambiguity.    Conclusion  Marr proposed that sleep may be the ideal state for systems consolidation to occur [ 23 , 24 ]. However, the cyclical and unavoidable nature of this state in living animals makes exacting experimental designs to test causality very difficult to realise. Consequently, convincing tests of his ideas have been lacking. A growing body of data nonetheless points to the possibility that the hippocampal–neocortical interactions that reflect systems consolidation can occur more rapidly than others after Marr have generally considered [ 3 , 20 , 73 ]. An interventional approach inhibiting one or the other brain area during sleep or novelty would be ideal to test necessity or sufficiency, but the putative interdependence of the underlying processes limits the ability to achieve selective interventions. Nonetheless, our observations showing that hippocampal and cortical consolidation systems can interact offers further evidence for the dynamic nature of postencoding memory processing and their modulation by such factors as event-associated novelty, context preexposure, and postencoding sleep. The competitive memory study design sets the stage for future, more detailed investigations into the mechanisms of the hippocampal and cortical memory systems and their interactions.     Methods   Animals  The subjects were adult male Lister hooded rats (Charles River, United Kingdom [UK]), aged 8–10 wks at the start of experimentation and weighing ~250 g. They were housed in groups of four rats per cage. They had free access to food and water at all times and were kept on a delayed day–night cycle (behavioural experiments 12 p.m. –12 a.m. light on; qPCR experiments 10 a.m. –10 p.m. light on). After arrival, the animals adapted to the environment for at least a week and were handled across 3 d for at least 5 min per day before progressing to the watermaze habituation. A total of 305 rats were used (behavioural experiments: n = 160; qPCR experiments: n = 155).    Ethics Statement  All procedures were compliant with national (Animals [Scientific Procedures] Act, 1986) and international (European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986[86/609/EEC]) legislation governing the maintenance of laboratory animals and their use in scientific experiments. We used the minimal number of rats for the necessary statistical power, with random assignment to groups, and there was minimal suffering associated with any of the experimental procedures. The experiments were approved by the UK home office under the project licence number 60/4566 and the Experimental Request Forms by the Edinburgh University division of the National Veterinary Service.    Watermaze Habituation  The animals were habituated with a visual-cue version of the watermaze (diameter = 2 m) for 3 d prior to the main experimental day. During the four trials per day habituation, the rats had to find the submerged platform in the watermaze, indicated by a visual cue placed on top of the platform (diameter = 12 cm), while curtains surrounding the pool hid any extramaze cues. If the animals did not go to the platform within 120 s, they were guided to it by the experimenter (this occurred very rarely). After reaching the platform, the animals had to wait on the platform for 30 s before being picked up and the next trial began. All animals passed this habituation period with success, and with an average escape latency of <10 s on day 3. Thus, the animals were familiar with the procedure before spatial training was begun. To reduce further any experiment-associated stress, the animals were also habituated to the sleep cages (two times each for ~60 min) and the wake arena without any objects (15 min).    Watermaze Training  We used two basic designs for watermaze training: a two-session design for the behavioural experiments and a one-session design for the qPCR experiments.  The main training day for the behavioural experiments consisted of two sessions in the watermaze separated by 7.5 h; each session was composed of four consecutive training blocks (each training block contained two trials, with a 15-s intertrial interval) to one platform location with randomized, counterbalanced, and varied starting positions (north, east, south, and west). If the animals did not reach the platform by 120 s, they were guided to the location. After each session, the animals underwent one of the two conditions (e.g., sleep, N + SD—see below) in a counterbalanced matter. Further, the platform position (northeast, southwest) was also counterbalanced across session and condition (see S1 Fig ). Only animals that learned both platform locations successfully (block four escape latency < 55 s) were included in the zone analysis of the later probe trial. The probe trial was performed 7 d after the training day, and the animals were placed for 120 s in the watermaze without any platform present while their swim paths were tracked by automated software (Watermaze, Watermaze Software, Edinburgh, UK; [ 74 ]). Starting positions were counterbalanced and of equal distance to both platform locations (southwest, northeast). It should be noted that this software computes path parameters, including zone and dwell-time analyses, in a fully automatic manner—and is thus “blind” to the assignment of animals to groups and conditions.  For the qPCR experiments, a similar behavioural protocol was used for training, but with only one session to one platform location. A between-subject design was employed, with the single session of training (four blocks of two trials) to the single platform location followed by either N + SD or sleep before humane killing at varying intervals and RT-qPCR analysis of brain tissue.  In addition to the Base, Pre-E, and Int experiments of the behavioural study described in the main text, we performed an additional control experiment ( S2 Fig ). To investigate if the effects seen in the N + SD condition were indeed caused by novelty, we repeated the Int experiment using animals that had been sleep deprived with gentle handling rather than novelty exposure (Int-SD).    Sleep and Novelty + Sleep Deprivation Procedures  In the sleep condition, the animals were kept in individual cages with video monitoring. Because of the high number of animals (>300), we were unable to perform implanted EEG recordings; instead, with the tracking data from the video monitoring of these animals, we calculated estimated sleep periods, defining sleep as at least >5 s with no movement [ 75 ]. We verified that total sleep time (M = 292.3 min ± 4.8) as well as length (M = 1.58 min ± 0.03) and number (M = 187.8 ± 3.1) of sleep bouts were similar to polysomnographic verified recordings.  Novelty with sleep deprivation was undertaken in individual compartments in an arena over a period of 6 h, with one experimenter assigned per four animals, their role being to monitor the rats and introduce novel objects as soon as the animal showed signs of tiredness (e.g., curling up). This procedure required considerable concentration by the experimenters and thus was done in shifts but was conducted in a conscientious manner ( S4 Fig , left). Sleep deprivation (SD) without novelty (for the control studies) was performed in the home cages by gently tapping the cage or removing the cover as soon as the animal showed signs of tiredness ( S4 Fig , right).    Watermaze Analysis (Zone and Cluster)  We analysed the watermaze probe trial data in two ways: zone analysis of swim time and dwell time map–based cluster analysis. For each analysis, the data of 3–60 s of the probe trial was used to avoid the bias added by starting position.   Zone analysis  For the zone analysis, we extracted the swim time for each individual animal in the zone centred at the platform location (diameter = 86 cm). Chance level was determined by the pool area in the zone divided by the overall pool area.    Cluster analysis  Two-dimensional spatial dwell time maps were produced using the complete x and y coordinates of paths tracked from Watermaze that consisted of binned dwell time data, with each bin representing 1 pixel of the tracking area window. These maps were rotated by 180° for 50% of the animals (as necessary) and then averaged to give a mean dwell time map for all of the animals. This average dwell time map was then smoothed using a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel given by:     g ( x ) = e x p ( − x 2 /   2 σ 2 − y 2 2 σ 2 )    where σ was set to 2.5. This setting allowed smoothing of the dwell time map from a raw state without losing local dwell time features.  For further analyses to proceed, it was necessary to remove background noise and top threshold areas where the animals spent little time. The dwell time maps were normalized and bins removed where the dwell time was less than 50% of the maximum. We then isolated distinct regions of interest and removed regions with areas of less than 100 contiguous pixels. Custom MATLAB scripts were then used to determine the locations of local maxima in the remaining areas of the dwell time map.  Further MATLAB scripts were used to cluster these local maxima. We used the gap statistic method [ 37 , 76 ] to objectively quantify the optimal number of clusters in our local maxima, this being based on Euclidean distance values. Using the optimal number of clusters suggested by this method, local maxima were clustered using a hierarchical clustering method [ 77 , 78 ].  To quantify the characteristics of the resulting clusters, a number of measures were used. One was the average distance between every point and every other point in a cluster (PtoP) and another the average distance between every point in a cluster and the centroid of that cluster (PtoC); these two measures served to quantify the sparsity of a cluster. That is, the more dispersed the points are, the higher these two measures should be. For each cluster, we also calculated its convex hull (the smallest nonconcave polygon that can enclose all points in a cluster), the area of which was expressed as a percentage of the watermaze total area. For each cluster, the dwell time values found in the dwell time map at the location of each peak included was extracted for that cluster. This was used to determine the intensity of a cluster’s peak values. Further, we calculated the distance between the centre of the cluster and the actual platform location, indicating the accuracy of the memory. The importance of these measures lay in the prospect of identifying whether a spatial memory trace existed in circumstances due to the experimental design, where it may be dominated by another trace.  In order to determine if these clustering methods were biased towards a particular set of observations, we also analysed similarly composed sets of random data. For each experiment, a random set of local maxima locations were artificially created, equal in number to those observed in the real dataset and constrained within a circle of the same dimensions as our watermaze. These artificial maxima were clustered as described above, and the same measures were extracted for each. This process was repeated 100 times.     RTqPCR Analysis   Experimental design  We performed qPCR measurements on brain tissue derived from two types of behavioural experiments: (1) encoding or consolidation, and (2) retrieval (see main Fig 3 ). With exception of the home cage controls ( n = 5 and n = 16), all animals were trained with the one-session training protocol (see above).  The animals were culled either 30 min after encoding ( n = 5) or at different intervals (2h, 4h, and 6h) after encoding with either sleep or N + SD in the intervening period (each n = 5). Further, we included a NoWM group (no exposure to the watermaze, also functions as home cage controls) directly at 30 min as well as both a NoWM and WM group after a 5 h interval with either Sleep or N + SD.  After the training day with either Sleep or N + SD, half the animals had a 24 h interference trial (similar to Base and Int experiments), and all animals were culled 30 min after the 7 d probe trial (each n = 16; S6 Fig ). Immediately after extracting the brains, bilateral hippocampi and the medial prefrontal cortex were dissected and frozen with liquid nitrogen for later processing.    RT-qPCR  Briefly, samples were homogenized and RNA was obtained via phenol-chloroform extraction according to the manufacturers’ instruction. Next, cDNA was synthesized in vitro with use of random hexamers. Subsequently, a RT-qPCR and comparative Ct quantitation was performed in experimental duplicates for cFos, Arc, Zif268, and 18S ribosomal RNA as the internal control on a StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, United States) PCR machine. Plates were counterbalanced and amplification thresholds set manually (StepOne Software Version 2.3, Life Technologies). The amplified product size was verified using gel electrophoresis and amplification checked for primer-dimer formation and nonefficient DNase treatment. Data was normalized to the internal control 18S (also known as Rn18s, coding for ribosomal RNA47), and subsequently “fold” and then “percentage change” to home cage control or other control was calculated. Percent (%) change was used for statistical analysis and graphical presentation because fold change cannot be used for statistics and percent change gives a more intuitive sense of effect sizes. Note that a fold change of 2 corresponds to +100%, whereas a fold change of 0.5 would be a –100% change. Thus, a fold change of 0.08 corresponds to –1,170% change. For comparison, both fold and percent change for the consolidation period are presented in S1 – S3 Tables.  Further, to control for nonrelevant, confounding effects, we performed paired analysis between two experimental groups. For encoding and consolidation, we compared 30 min and 5 h after the watermaze encoding session animals that experienced the watermaze (WM) directly with animals that had not experienced the watermaze (NoWM). Thus, positive values on the y -axis show that animals consolidating a memory (WM) show higher gene expression than animals that are not consolidating a memory (NoWM), independent of what they are doing at the moment (sleep/N + SD). Additionally, to investigate the differences between sleep and N + SD animals at retrieval, we calculated percentage change (sleep > N + SD) on each plate and then averaged the data (see S7 Fig ). Primers were: 18S left: atggttcctttggtcgctcg, right: ggcagacgttcgaatgggtc; Zif left: aacactttgtggcctgaacc, right: ggcagaggaagacgatgaag; cFos left: gagggagctgacagatacgc, right: tgggctgccaaaataaactc; Arc left: agctggaacctcatccacac, right: cagcagtggaactggtctca.      Supporting Information   S1 Fig   Counterbalanced design for the 2-session training day.  Half the animals were trained in session 1 to a platform location in NW (top row) while the other half to SE (bottom row). Each group was subdivided and assigned to either Sleep or N+SD during the first consolidation window, after which each animal was trained to the other platform position and had subsequently the other experimental condition. Each behavior experiment (Base, Pre-E, Ext, Ext-SD, New P) used an n = 8 for each of the four sub-groups (total n = 32 per experiment). Note that in the data presentations of the main paper, the data derived from the top and bottom rows is pooled by rotating half of the data by 180°.  (TIF)     S2 Fig   Supplemental experiment.  The experimental design involved a group Ext, as described in the main text, that received an extinction trial (120s) 24h after the training day and followed by a 7d probe trial. Ext-SD used the same general design; however the sleep deprivation (SD) procedure involved gentle handling rather than novelty.  (TIF)     S3 Fig   Sleep protocol.

Always half the animals were Sleep and N+SD for 6h post training.  (TIF)     S7 Fig   qPCR plates.  The qPCR data on each plate was analyzed in two ways. (A) For Encoding, Consolidation and Retrieval we calculated fold and then percentage change to home cage controls. That is, the blue triplicates for the sleep condition were compared with the white home-cage triplicates; likewise the orange N+SD triplicates. (B) Additional for Retrieval, we also calculated the relative fold-change of the two conditions (Sleep>N+SD) since these pairs controlled for additional effects e.g. swimming in the water maze.

Note correlation was weakest for the Extinction condition for which the extinction caused an apparent loss of the memory representation for the N+SD platform location, causing the regression line to cross the y-axis (N+SD) on a lower value while the crossing at the x-axis (Sleep) becomes slight higher. *p <0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.

(TIF)     S11 Fig   Supplement experiments.  A. Control experiments (Base-SD and Int-SD) were run similarly to the Base and Int experiment described in the main text. For Base/Int-SD the animals were deprived of sleep during the consolidation window after encoding with gentle handling instead of novelty exposure to isolate its effect. B. There was no significant difference across the averages of the two zones, indicating normal swim behavior in all experiments. C. The zone analysis shows that only in the novelty experiments a differential effect of the conditions was seen across experiments. Novelty/gentle handling X condition X experiment interaction F = 3.7, df 1/116, p = 0.033 *p <0.05, **p<0.01 t-test to chance.  (TIF)     S12 Fig   Visual illustration of the cluster analysis (Base experiment).  (From left to right): Dwell Time Map, filtered Dwell Time Map, locations of peak activity (local maxima), peak locations displayed on Dwell Time Map. Automated cluster assignments of peak locations, point to center distances (PtoC), point to point distances (PtoP), cluster area (convex hull).  (TIF)     S13 Fig   Cluster analysis.  Presented are the different measures from the cluster analysis for the Base, Pre-E and Ext experiment. (Top row, left to right): Point to point distances (PtoP), point to center distance (PtoC), Average activity for the cluster peaks drawn from the dwell time maps; (Bottom row): Cluster size in % area of pool and pixel, distance from cluster centre to platform position. Both PtoP and Average Activity showed a significant condition (Sleep, N+SD) X experiment (Base, Pre-E) interaction (*p<0.05). Since only one cluster was present, Ext was not included in the statistical analysis.  (TIF)     S14 Fig   RT-qPCR analysis.  Shown as fold change (in contrast to % change of the main figure). HPC = hippocampus, mPFC = medial prefrontal cortex, N+SD = novelty with sleep deprivation, HC = home cage controls. Means +/- 1 SEM.  (TIF)     S15 Fig   Retrieval-associated IEG expression.  A direct comparison of N+SD with Sleep at retrieval is displayed with positive values reflecting higher gene expression in Sleep and negative values higher gene expression in N+SD. A gene x brain area interaction was seen (F = 4.4, df 2/60, p<0.03, with post-hoc linear contrast p<0.03), with Sleep showing higher cFos expression in the HPC but higher Arc and Zif-268 expression in the mPFC, with the opposite pattern for N+SD.  (TIF)     S16 Fig   Retrieval-associated IEG expression.  Left panel: At retrieval in comparison to HC, HPC showed higher changes in IEG expression than mPFC (F = 14.7, df 1/60, p<0.001) and, contrasting to encoding (i.e. left panel vs Fig 3B ), a significant gene x trial type effect was seen (F = 3.9, df 1.28/85.9, p<0.05; Greenhouse-Geisser correction). Right panel: IEG expression is plotted as percentage change relative to home-cage control, and separated into groups of animals that either had (Exp A, blue) or did not have (Exp B) a retrieval trial 24 hr after training as well as at the 7d test just prior to culling. ** p<0.01, ***p<0.001.  (TIF)     S17 Fig   Time spent sleeping and gene expression.  The correlations between IEG expression measured after the consolidation period in the Sleep condition (all three 2, 4, 6h) and the amount of time spend sleeping (as measured by motion analysis). There were no significant effects in the HPC, but all three genes showed a significant negative correlation between the amount of time asleep (total sleep time, TST) and gene expression in comparison to home cage controls. ** p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

Whole slide imaging (WSI) is a useful tool for multi-modal imaging, and in our work, we have often combined WSI with darkfield microscopy. However, traditional darkfield microscopy cannot use a single condenser to support high- and low-numerical-aperture objectives, which limits the modality of WSI. To overcome this limitation, we previously developed a darkfield internal reflection illumination (DIRI) microscope using white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Although the developed DIRI is useful for biological applications, substantial problems remain to be resolved. In this study, we propose a novel illumination technique called color DIRI. The use of three-color LEDs dramatically improves the capability of the system, such that color DIRI (1) enables optimization of the illumination color; (2) can be combined with an oil objective lens; (3) can produce fluorescence excitation illumination; (4) can adjust the wavelength of light to avoid cell damage or reactions; and (5) can be used as a photostimulator. These results clearly illustrate that the proposed color DIRI can significantly extend WSI modalities for biological applications.

Data Availability  All relevant data are within the paper.    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.g008   Introduction  The complexity of the human body makes it difficult to understand. For example, it consists of between 50 and 75 trillion cells, and its genes are capable of creating over 20,000 proteins. Optical microscopy is the main tool used to investigate the structure and functions of cells, tissues, and organs in the human body. Scientists have a wide variety of imaging techniques and tools at their disposal to better understand complicated biological environments. Whole slide imaging (WSI) or so call vertual slide technology is one of the core imaging techniques, which enables automated imaging and allows scientists to observe large samples. Microscopes performing WSI can easily be connected to the Internet, raising the prospect of Internet of Things applications. The observation area of WSI is not limited to the field of view of an objective lens [ 1 – 5 ].  Darkfield microscopy combined with WSI is often used to observe the details of tissue and cell structures. The main advantage of darkfield microscopy is that unstained samples can be observed due to a mismatch in the refractive index, which generates image contrast, although staining with an appropriate color is often required [ 6 ]. The typical set-up of transmitted darkfield illumination consists of a halogen burner bulb with either a central stop for darkfield in a standard brightfield condenser or a dedicated substage darkfield condenser. Central axial illumination from the halogen burner bulb is blocked by the darkfield central stop. Peripheral illumination obliquely illuminates a specimen contained on a slide from the bottom. Thus, only forward-scattered light or refracted light from the specimen enters the objective lens ( Fig 1a ), which creates darkfield images. We show the advantages of darkfield microscopy using real samples. Fig 1b shows a brightfield image of cheek cells using UPlanSApo 60× oil, numerical aperture (NA) 1.35 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), with an extended magnification lens of 2.5×. The human cheek cell (epithelial cell) sample was freshly taken using Q-chip and diluted in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS). The image contrast was low, making it difficult to observe the cells. A darkfield image of the cheek cells is shown in Fig 1c ; in this image, the background is very dark, which results in the granules inside the cells being clearly resolved.   10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.g001  Fig 1   Cheek cell image using brightfield and darkfield microscopy.  (a) Schematic diagrams of a darkfield condenser, (b) brightfield microscopy image, and (c) darkfield microscopy image of a cheek cell. Scale bars in the Figs represent 5 μm. Images were taken with UplanSapo 60× oil (NA 1.35). All images (b, c) were taken using the color camera.     Conventional darkfield units are commercially available for a standard microscope. There are two types of darkfield condensers: dry and oil. A dry darkfield condenser cannot be used with objective lenses that have a NA > 0.8, because the illumination cone passes directly through the objective lens and eliminates the dark background of the image. An oil darkfield condenser, on the other hand, can accept such a high-NA lens. However, if a user needs to switch from an oil lens to a dry lens, the condenser also must be switched back to the dry darkfield condenser. This necessitates the disruptive and somewhat laborious process of removing the oil from the slide, which is incompatible with automated WSI.  To overcome this problem, we previously developed darkfield internal reflection illumination (DIRI) with white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [ 7 , 8 ]. DIRI eliminates sources of light from the top and bottom of a sample using a side-illuminated darkfield, which is an improved version of a Hausmann’s darkfield illuminator [ 9 ], occasionally used for brain imaging [ 10 – 13 ]. Although the developed DIRI is useful [ 7 , 8 ], it has substantial limitations that must be addressed to make it more useful for biological applications. For example, the original DIRI cannot control the wavelength of light, which is essential for fluorescence excitation. Controlling the wavelength is also important for avoiding cell damage or reactions.  In this study, therefore, we developed a novel color DIRI system using three-color LEDs. This modification dramatically improves the capability of the system. Specifically, it enables users to control the wavelength of light, which is useful for fluorescence excitation, avoiding cell damage and reactions. We show that our color DIRI has a color balance function and is effective for samples with or without staining. Moreover, the system can be used to investigate phototactic activities of cells. We use Euglena gracilis as a model microorganism [ 14 – 19 ], and show that the color DIRI can actually induce phototactic behavior of cells. Lastly, we discuss the advantages of the color DIRI compared with Hausmann’s darkfield and white DIRI. Our ultimate goal is to develop an automated microscope system with multiple modes of use via color DIRI.    Materials and Methods   Sample preparation   TMA sample  We used an 11-core TMA sample (BSB0297; BioSB, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The TMA consisted of 11 2-mm cores of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The array configuration allows validation of reagents for immunohistochemistry applications. The 11-core TMA contains the following tissues: placenta, colon, prostate, skin, thyroid, liver, brain, kidney, tonsil, breast, and fallopian tube. We stained TMA samples using the primary antibody p40 for a brown color (DAB staining) and the primary antibody TTF-1 for magenta via a Polydetector Detection Systems staining kit (BioSB, Santa Barbara, CA, USA).    Brain slice sample  Wild-type mice (C57BL/6J, 12 weeks old) and yellow fluorescence protein (YFP-H) mice (23 weeks old) were used. The YFP-H mouse line was provided to Riken by Drs. J. R. Sanes and J. W. Lichtman. The YFP-H mouse lines were maintained by crossing with C57BL/6J mice for several generations. The experimental procedures and housing conditions for the animals were approved by the Riken Institute’s Animal Experiments Committee, and all animals were cared for and treated humanely in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines for Experiments Using Animals.  The mice were anesthetized using pentobarbital (Somnopentyl, 60 mg/kg body weight; Kyouritsu Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS containing 10 U/mL heparin (Mochida Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), followed by 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA)/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (−). The dissected brains were subjected to post-fixation in 4% PFA/PBS (−) at 4°C overnight and embedded in Tissue-Tek (O.C.T. compound; Sakura, Torrance, CA, USA). A YFP-H mouse brain was cut into 50-μm-thick sagittal sections with a cryostat (CM1860; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).  Before diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining, 30-μm-thick sections of wild-type mouse produced using a cryostat were treated with 3% H 2 O 2 in MeOH for 30 min. The brain sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (−) for 5 min and then treated with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. The sections were incubated with primary antibody [anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody (Millipore #MAB377, 1:400)] in PBS-T overnight at 4°C, and incubated with secondary antibody [HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (MBL #PM009-7, 1:1000)] for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody [HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (MBL #PM009-7)] for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the sections were incubated in DAB substrate solution (#SK-4100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.    Euglena gracilis sample  In this study, we used Euglena gracilis as a model microorganism to show that the color DIRI is useful for investigating the photo responses of cells. E . gracilis is a unicellular flagellate in fresh water. Photo responses of E . gracilis have been studied for over a century [ 14 – 19 ]. Blue and green light illumination of E . gracilis induces positive or negative phototactic responses, resulting in accumulation or avoidance, respectively [ 16 , 17 ]. The phototactic responses of E . gracilis to light of different wavelengths ranging from near ultraviolet (UV) to red were reported previously [ 19 ]. E . gracilis was cultivated using diluted water with a plant nutrition solution (Pot in AO; Fumakilla Limited, Tokyo, Japan) in a bottle for 10 days. The sample cells were loaded between the coverslip and microscope slide glass. We introduced a spacer to create a gap. This gap between the slide glass and the coverslip was approximately 0.4 mm.     Equipment set-up   Microscope set-up  In all experiments, the base system comprised the Virtual Slide System VS120 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and VS-ASW WSI software (ver. 2.8). A schematic diagram of the optical layout is shown in Fig 2 . The WSI system set-up included a microscope imaging system with cameras, an objective lens, a motorized focus system, and a motorized X-Y stage. Two cameras were used: a black and white camera (Orca R2; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) and a color camera (VC50, CCD; Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Münster, Germany). This system contained a standard substage condenser, a transmitted brightfield illuminator, a fluorescence illuminator, and the color DIRI system. This configuration allowed automated acquisition of a specimen image. The acquisition parameters were configured using software to select the magnification (objective lens) and observation method (e.g. transmitted brightfield, fluorescence); the software controls the positioning of the stage and focus, such that images can be taken automatically. The color DIRI system was a prototype, and there was no commercial version. The physical arrangement of the LEDs and slide is the same with Fig 1 in our previous publication [ 7 ]. To avoid photo responses of E . gracilis , we added the sharp cut-off filter SC68 and reduced the exposure to visible light. This SC68 filter transmits light with a wavelength longer than 680 nm.   10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.g002  Fig 2   Schematic of the whole slide imaging (WSI) system with darkfield internal reflection illumination (DIRI).  DIRI was incorporated into the WSI system’s motorized stage. Three color light-emitting diodes (LEDs) illuminate the slide glass from the side, and the specimen scatters this light. The scattered light is then incident on the objective lens above the stage. The dichromatic mirror on the motorized turret of the microscope can be removed from the light path when acquiring darkfield images. A tube lens above the dichromatic mirror focuses the sample image onto the imaging device. A charge-coupled device camera then captures the image. A sharp cut-off filter is placed between the field diaphragm and the mirror.       Color DIRI set-up  The previous method of white DIRI illumination [ 7 , 8 ] uses a thin array of white LEDs. The present version of DIRI illumination uses a three-color-LED array ( Fig 3 ), which is commercially available (NeoPixel Stick–ID 14268; Adafruit, New York, NY, USA). This LED array uses eight sets of three-color (red, blue, and green) LEDs (Worldsemi WS2812 5050 RGB). The dimensions are 51.1 × 10.22 × 3.19 mm. The WS2812 datasheet shows that the red, green, and blue LEDs emit light over the wavelength ranges of 620–630 nm (550–700 mcd), 515–530 nm (1100–1400 mcd), and 465–475 nm (200–400 mcd), respectively. The physical arrangement of the LEDs is shown in Fig 3(c) . The distance between the blue and green LEDs is about 1.2 mm. The red LED is placed in between the blue and green LEDs.   10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.g003  Fig 3   DIRI with three-color-LED array.  (a) The three-color-LED array and controller, (b) a sample illuminated with green-LED array, (c) a schematic diagram of the three-color LEDs and a slide glass sample, and (d) a sample illuminated with red (left), green (middle), and blue (right) LEDs in the E gracilis experiment.     Each LED is addressable by its internal driver chip. The operation frequency is 800 kHz. Each individual LED is controlled by an Arduino UNO (Arduino, Turin, Italy) microcontroller, with a clock speed of 16 MHz; the brightness of the LED light can be controlled and the light can be turned on or off with millisecond precision via the microcontroller. We attached LEDs of three colors to the DIRI illuminator for WSI. Before use, the WSI system was calibrated using the VS-ASW software and the recommended calibration slide from the manufacturer. For measuring light intensity in the experiment, we used Illuminance Meter T-10 (Minolta, Tokyo, Japan).      Results and Discussion   Color balance adjustment  We observed a tissue microarray (TMA) sample of skin tissue using brightfield and color DIRI illumination. The color balance could be set on the color DIRI using a NeoPixel intensity interface where each color LED can be adjusted on a scale of intensity from 0 to 255, 255 being the maximum. Fig 4 shows the TMA sample illuminated by: (a) brightfield illumination with a halogen bulb; (b) DIRI illumination using red LEDs, with a maximum illumination intensity of 1800 lux and NeoPixel intensity of red 255; (c) DIRI illumination with green LEDs, with a maximum illumination intensity of 3700 lux and NeoPixel intensity of green 255; and (d) DIRI illumination with blue LEDs, with a maximum illumination intensity of 1000 lux and NeoPixel intensity of blue 255. The illumination intensity was measured using a Minolta intensity meter. We confirmed that DIRI with red, green, or blue LEDs properly illuminated the TMA sample with each color, and the DIRI image provided a more detailed structure than that with brightfield illumination with white light. Although the image quality of Fig 4d is not high, we believe this is due to the low sensitivity of the CCD to blue light and could be improved by another sensor.   10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.g004  Fig 4   Brightfield image and red, green, and blue darkfield internal reflection illumination (DIRI) images of tissue microarray (TMA) sample.  (a) Illuminated by brightfield, (b) red, (c) green, and (d) blue. All images were taken with UplanSapo 40× oil (NA 0.95) using the VC50 color camera. The exposure times are; (a) 8.7 ms, (b-d) 700 ms. The sample was skin tissue. Scale bars in the Figs represent 200 μm.     Fig 5 shows the advantages of the color balancing properties of color DIRI. We observed TMA samples of three different tissues: brain tissue (top left), skin tissue (top right), and liver tissue (bottom), with color DIRI. The first set ( Fig 5a1 ) used a maximum illumination intensity of 6400 lux. The NeoPixel intensity set-up was red 255, green 255, and blue 255. Our sensory evaluation results showed that the background of the image was blue in color. To improve the color tone, we modified the NeoPixel intensity to red 150, green 255, and blue 100. The resulting illumination intensity was 5000 lux. The resultant image is shown in Fig 5b1 . Our sensory evaluation results showed that the background of the image of b1 had less blue color than a1.   10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.g005  Fig 5   Maximum intensity illumination of color DIRI and color balance modification.  (a1) Image taken with the maximum intensity of color DIRI with red 255, green 255, and blue 255. (a2) Photoshop color chart of a1 showing the location in the color balance. (b1) Image taken with the modified color DIRI with red 150, green 255, and blue 100. (b2) Photoshop color chart of b1 showing the location in the color balance. All images (a1, b1) were taken with UplanSapo 40× oil (NA 0.95) using the VC50 color camera. The exposure time is 400 ms. The sample was skin tissue. Scale bars in the Figs represent 200 μm.     Color maps measured by Photoshop software at the center of Fig 5a1 and 5b1 are shown in Fig 5a2 and 5b2 , respectively. The background color can be analyzed in terms of hue (H), saturation (S), and brightness (B). Image a1 had the values of H: 241, S: 60, and B: 38, whereas image b1 had H: 247, S: 40, and B: 17. By reducing the intensities of red and blue light, the background color became a more natural black in b1. We see that the background color in b1 is less blue and darker than that in a1.  These results clearly illustrate that the independent control of the three-color LEDs could improve the color balance of DIRI illumination compared with white-LED illumination. We think that the color balance function of our color DIRI is novel and advantageous compared with the standard Hausmann’s darkfield and white DIRI. Comparisons to Hausmann’s darkfield and white DIRI will be presented later.    Observation of DAB-stained brain slice  3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining is one of the most commonly used staining methods. We thus checked the utility of our color DIRI using a DAB-stained brain tissue section. Fig 6a shows the sample under brightfield illumination, while Fig 6b shows the sample observed by using color DIRI. The light intensity was set as red 150, green 225, and blue 100, for a total of 5,000 lux. The DIRI image shows the structure of the corpus callosum, whereas the brightfield image does not. The results indicate that color DIRI is useful for observing the structures of DAB-stained samples.   10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.g006  Fig 6   Diaminobenzidine (DAB)-stained brain slices.  (a) Brightfield image. (b) Color DIRI image with red 150, green 225, and blue 100. Images were taken with PlanApon 2× (NA 0.08) (a), and UPlanSapo20× (NA 0.75) (b). The exposure times are (a) 4 ms, and (b) 150 ms. Both are using the VC50 color camera. Scale bars indicate 0.5 mm.     If two illuminators (such as transmitted and DIRI) are used, the color balance of one of them has to be adjusted. Otherwise, it is necessary to change the color balance of the camera itself when switching the illuminator. We included the ability to change the color balance in the darkfield illuminator (color DIRI); thus, it is possible to switch to a brightfield mode without changing the camera settings. This is ideal for automated image acquisition.    Observation of brain slice without visible color staining  We examined the effectiveness of color DIRI in the imaging of samples without visible color staining. Fig 7 shows images of a brain section not stained by a visible dye. We first obtained a large image of the brain slice using a PlanApon 2× objective lens with brightfield illumination ( Fig 7a ). We can see that the image contrast is low, making it difficult to distinguish structures in the sample. The illumination method was then switched to color DIRI using the same objective lens, as shown in Fig 7b . The color DIRI image has significantly higher contrast than the brightfield image, indicating the effectiveness of color DIRI, even for a sample without staining.   10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.g007  Fig 7   Brain slice images obtained by color DIRI.

Scale bars in the Figs represent (a–d) 2 mm and (e, f) 0.1 mm.       Observation of brain slice staining with a fluorescent marker  First, we examined the fluorescence imaging of the brain using blue LED excitation illumination from the color DIRI system. We compared the epifluorescence image and blue LED excitation image using fluorescent proteins (YFP-H). Using the objective lens UplanSapo 40×, NA 0.9, we observed the area Z1, which is highlighted in Fig 7b .  Second, we acquired a standard epifluorescence image ( Fig 7d ). Moreover, by using an excitation filter, we obtained the median values of the excitation wavelength, full width at half maximum (FWHM), and full bandwidth to be 494, 20, and 25 nm, respectively. The illumination wavelength was approximately 481.5–506.5 nm. Because of a sharp and narrow cut-off bandpass filter, the full bandwidth was only 5 nm wider than FWHM. The background of the fluorescence image was dark, and the fluorescence image could be seen at a very high contrast.  In addition, in Fig 7c , the wavelength of the illuminated blue LED and the median of the excitation wavelength was 467 nm, the FWHM was 10 nm, and the full bandwidth was 100 nm. The illumination wavelength was approximately 417–517 nm. However, the full bandwidth was 90 nm wider than that of the FWHM as a broad band blue LED was used. Fluorescent proteins (YFP-H) were excited using the blue LED. From Fig 7c , we can analyze that the color DIRI can produce the fluorescent image. However, in the case of the fluorescence image in Fig 7c , the LED light with wavelength of approximately 517 nm was making bleed through of excitation filter (515–545 nm) and into camera. This broader wavelength of blue LED light, especially 517 nm light passed through the emission filter, which created a slightly brighter background in Fig 7c than that in Fig 7d . Although blue LED excitation provides a slightly brighter background, it is convenient for us to use the color DIRI in many practical situations as it allows us to easily adjust the wavelength of light during fluorescent imaging.  Another advantage of the color DIRI is that it provides easy and automatic image acquisition with oil objectives. As shown in Fig 7(e) , we examined color DIRI together with a UPLSAPO40×, NA 1.25, silicone oil immersion objective lens. Easy and automatic image acquisition was successfully achieved in this study. Fig 7(f) shows an image using epifluorescent imaging for comparison. The contrast for the image background in Fig 7(f) is higher than that in Fig 7(e) ; however, the performance for the color DIRI is acceptable.  Theoretically, if we can set a bandpass filter between a white LED and a slide glass sample, controlling the illumination wavelength is possible. However, the space between the LED and the slide sample is limited. Thus, it is difficult to mechanically install the bandpass filter. As our former white DIRI system could not acquire fluorescent images, the proposed color DIRI system demonstrates significant progress regarding imaging capabilities.    Observation of photo response of Euglena gracilis  Next, we examined whether the color DIRI could be utilized to investigate the photo response of cells using Euglena gracilis , which has been a subject of intense investigations [ 14 – 19 ]. In this experiment, we used two kinds of illumination: one for sample observation and the other for photo stimulation. The illumination for sample observation was transmitted illumination generated by a halogen lightbulb with an SC68 sharp cut-off filter; this filter only transmits light of a wavelength longer than 680 nm. The SC68 filter, which is a long pass filter from 680 nm, can reduce the photo response of E gracilis , given that E gracilis shows phototaxis to shorter wavelengths [ 16 , 17 , 19 ]. The illumination for photo stimulation was generated by the color DIRI.  We placed E gracilis cells in a gap of 0.4 mm between a coverslip and a slide glass. When these cells were loaded, the DIRI LEDs were off. Initially, the cells were distributed across the entire region, as shown in Fig 8a . As a control, we acquired an image 10 min after the loading, as shown in Fig 8b . The cell distribution was similar to that in Fig 8a , and no accumulation of cells was observed near the LEDs, namely, in the blue ellipsoidal region.   10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.g008  Fig 8   Photo responses of E gracilis cells stimulated by green LED.  (a) Initial distribution of cells when the LED was off. Small black dots in the figure indicate cells. (b) The distribution of cells 10 min after loading when the LED was off. (c) The distribution of cells 30 min after turning on the green LED with an intensity of 5. Arrow indicates the position and direction of illumination of the LED. (d) Distribution of cells 10 min after increasing the light intensity to green 255. All images were taken with UPlanSapo10× (NA 0.4), and the scale bars in the figure represent 2 mm. All images were taken using Orca R2 color camera. The exposure time is 100 ms.     Next, we turned one LED on, the intensity of which was set as follows: red 0, green 5, and blue 0. The light intensity was 4 lux. Fig 8c shows the image acquired 30 min after LED illumination. We can see that many cells had accumulated in front of the LED, as indicated by the blue ellipse. In other words, E gracilis had exhibited phototaxis, swimming towards the light. We then increased the light intensity to red 0, green 255, and blue 0 (740 lux). Fig 8d shows an image acquired 10 min after this increase. We can see that quite a large number of cells accumulated in front of the LED, which indicates that the cells showed a stronger photoresponse upon an increase of the light intensity. The color DIRI can illuminate cells with three different colors and from eight different positions. We thus believe that the present system is useful for investigating the photo response of various swimming microorganisms.    Comparison with Hausmann’s darkfield and white LED DIRI  We compared three different darkfield illumination methods: Hausmann’s darkfield, white-LED DIRI, and three-color-LED DIRI. The results are summarized in Table 1 . The top five lines in Table 1 describe the apparatus required for each method. Hausmann’s darkfield uses side illumination, which involves the direct connection of a lightbulb or fiber illumination. In the case of DIRI, however, as we previously explained, the same illumination set-up cannot be used because DIRI was developed for an automated microscope for WSI [ 7 , 8 ]. DIRI should not be connected to a bulky tungsten or halogen lightbulb with a fiber bundle because the bulky units often interfere with the motorized stage. Given the small size of LEDs, they do not impose such a constraint.   10.1371/journal.pone.0167774.t001  Table 1  Comparison of Hausmann’s darkfield, white-LED DIRI, and three-color LED DIRI.

When we take a color image with brightfield and darkfield modes, color adjustment is always required. Three-color DIRI has the ability to adjust the illumination color balance. This is essential for taking brightfield and darkfield images using the same camera, which was not possible using white-LED DIRI. In the case of color DIRI, we can take both images without changing the camera set-up.  As shown in Fig 7 , fluorescent imaging can be performed only by color DIRI. This is one of its major advantages compared with the other two methods. Metal nanoparticles are also used in biological imaging. They exhibit a plasmonic resonance that induces unique optical properties. The excitation light for nanoparticles should have a shorter wavelength than the emission wavelength, which can be provided by color DIRI. Moreover, color DIRI can provide a darkfield image only using red illumination. The red illumination can prevent sample damage and photobleaching compared with white or blue light. Long-wavelength photons are less energetic and phototoxic. In addition, selective longer-wavelength darkfield illumination by color DIRI should reduce photobleaching and phototoxic effects. These characteristics of color DIRI are preferable for biological applications.  The color LEDs provide adjustable three-color illumination with eight sets of three-color LEDs. We can illuminate individual LEDs for selected locations. In addition, the LED controller has the ability to provide blinking illumination. These characteristics are favorable for investigating the photo responses of cells, as shown in Fig 8 . Overall, the color DIRI significantly extends the abilities of WSI compared with the other two methods.  The color LEDs provide a photo stimulator function. This function indicates that the system can control the color, intensity, and area of the illumination. Meanwhile, a Hausmann’s illuminator, could not control the illumination location, even if an optical filter were to be added to it. Consequently, using Hausmann’s illuminator would not be appropriate for a photo stimulator.    Color LED and LED array controller  The WS2812 array comprises three RGB LEDs, and we measured the distance between them. The distance between the blue and green LEDs was approximately 1.2 mm while the red LED was placed in between them. This fact indicates that one needs to carefully align the positions of the color LEDs relative to the slide glass. We also checked the commercially available microscope slide glass; the choices of available thickness were 0.8–1, 0.9–12, 1–1.2, and 1.2–1.5 mm. The most suitable of these was felt to be the 1.2–1.5 mm slide glass, as it can properly include the three RGB LEDs.  In this study, we used an Arduino UNO microcontroller to control the intensity of the LEDs. We only used a limited number of functions of the controller, such as the on/off switch and the illumination location selector. The use of some additional functions, such as the high-speed on/off switch and the select and switch illumination area, may be desirable in some situations. The update speed for Arduino UNO is 800 kHz, and each LED has a 24-bit color. Therefore, the update speed for eight LEDs is 1.25 ms. If the exposure time is on the order of this update speed, the illumination light makes frequency beating of the LED update speed against camera readout. More advanced features for controlling light are provided on the Arduino homepage “Fast, easy LED library for Arduino.” Moreover, another idea for improving frequency is provided by Tian and Waller [ 20 ]. If a better controller system such as Teensy 3.2 is used, a greater LED-array update speed can be obtained.     Conclusions  We developed three-color DIRI and investigated its usefulness. This system offers the following advantages compared with previous darkfield illumination methods:   Color DIRI provides a function for color balance adjustment. The color balance of the resulting images can be controlled by pre-adjusting the DIRI color via a simple operation.  Color DIRI provides darkfield imaging with high-magnification objective lenses, such as 20× dry and 40× oil. Illuminating the DAB-stained mid-sagittal brain slice with color DIRI provided a clear image of the structure of the corpus callosum.  The blue DIRI provides fluorescence excitation. We clearly observed the fluorescence protein (YFP-H).  Color DIRI partially illuminates the sample with different colors. Potentially, less sample damage occurs with red DIRI illumination. The DIRI can also provide blinking illumination.  Color DIRI can be used as a photo stimulator for investigating the photo responses of cells.   These results clearly illustrate that color DIRI significantly extends the capability of WSI compared with the conventional methods.

Background  Over 400,000 people across the Americas are thought to have been infected with Zika virus as a consequence of the 2015–2016 Latin American outbreak. Official government-led case count data in Latin America are typically delayed by several weeks, making it difficult to track the disease in a timely manner. Thus, timely disease tracking systems are needed to design and assess interventions to mitigate disease transmission.    Methodology/Principal Findings  We combined information from Zika-related Google searches, Twitter microblogs, and the HealthMap digital surveillance system with historical Zika suspected case counts to track and predict estimates of suspected weekly Zika cases during the 2015–2016 Latin American outbreak, up to three weeks ahead of the publication of official case data. We evaluated the predictive power of these data and used a dynamic multivariable approach to retrospectively produce predictions of weekly suspected cases for five countries: Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela, and Martinique. Models that combined Google (and Twitter data where available) with autoregressive information showed the best out-of-sample predictive accuracy for 1-week ahead predictions, whereas models that used only Google and Twitter typically performed best for 2- and 3-week ahead predictions.    Significance  Given the significant delay in the release of official government-reported Zika case counts, we show that these Internet-based data streams can be used as timely and complementary ways to assess the dynamics of the outbreak.     Author Summary  In the absence of access to real-time government-reported Zika case counts, we demonstrate the ability of Internet-based data sources to track the outbreak. Our model predictions fill a critical time-gap in existing Zika surveillance, given that early interventions and real-time surveillance are necessary to curb mosquito transmission. Official Zika case reports will likely continue to be delayed in their release; thus, it is important that health and government officials have access to real-time and future estimates of Zika activity in order to allocate resources according to potential changes in outbreak dynamics. The methodologies presented here may be expanded to any country–and perhaps finer spatial resolutions–to identify changes in Zika transmission for public health decision-makers.    The authors received no specific funding for this work.          PLOS Publication Stage  uncorrected-proof    Data Availability  Google, Twitter, and epidemiologic PAHO and Ministry of Health data are publicly available, and their sources are specified within the paper. Zika-related HealthMap data is available upon written request to Emily Cohn at Boston Children's Hospital ( emily.cohn@childrens.harvard.edu ).    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005295.g003   Introduction  The rapid spread of Zika virus has led to more than 400,000 suspected cases across the Americas since its introduction to Brazil in 2014, and has triggered alerts around the globe[ 1 ]. This event has led to diverse interventions and travel warnings to affected areas, underscoring the importance of proactive disease surveillance. While cases of sexual transmission of Zika virus have been documented[ 2 ], the virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito and causes nonspecific flu-like symptoms and skin rashes[ 3 , 4 ]. Of particular concern is the possible link between Zika virus and neurological disorders such as microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies of infected pregnant women are born with abnormally small heads[ 5 – 8 ]. Over 1800 cases of Zika-related microcephaly and central nervous system disorders in newborns have been reported since the beginning of the epidemic, and the virus has spread to 70 countries globally[ 9 ]. In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika a global public health emergency[ 10 ]. With no existing vaccinations or treatment for Zika infections, control of the Aedes aegypti mosquito is critical to curb the spread of the virus, as has been observed in dengue fever studies[ 11 , 12 ]. This requires continuous and up-to-date surveillance of cases to drive vector control interventions accordingly[ 13 ].  In countries with now autochthonous transmission, the surveillance of Zika infections is predominantly passive; cases are identified on the basis of hospitalizations and clinical symptom reports. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) currently streamlines reports from ministries of health, and reports weekly confirmed and suspected cases of Zika by country[ 14 ]. The release of these reports and those produced by the ministries, however, is typically delayed by three or more weeks due to systematic processing and data collection. As a consequence, the changing dynamics of Zika are frequently hard to be assessed in a timely manner, and thus, the availability of current data on Zika to the public and public health officials is limited.  In the past decade, the near real-time availability of novel and disparate internet-based data sources has motivated the development of complementary methodologies to track the incidence and spread of diseases. These approaches exploit near real-time information from internet search engines[ 15 – 18 ], news reports[ 19 – 21 ], clinician’s search engines[ 22 ], crowd-sourced participatory disease surveillance systems[ 23 – 25 ], Twitter microblogs[ 26 – 29 ], Electronic Health Records[ 30 ], and satellite images[ 31 ] to estimate the presence of a disease in a given location.  Some of the biases and errors observed when using these alternative data sources as individual indicators of disease incidence have been recently mitigated by using ensemble approaches that combine information from multiple data sources to produce a more robust disease estimate[ 32 ]. In parallel, multiple improvements have been proposed to disease tracking methodologies based on Google searches[ 33 – 38 ]. Finally, it has been shown that in the absence of information from traditional government-lead disease reporting, the combined use of news reports and Google’s search activity of the word “zika” in Colombia led to reasonable estimates of cumulative cases of Zika[ 20 ]. To the best of our knowledge, however, no attempts have been made to date to harness these and other digital data sources for near-real time weekly forecasting of Zika infections.  Here we assess the feasibility of using Zika-related Google search queries, Zika-related Twitter microblogs, and information from news reports collected by the web-based surveillance system HealthMap[ 16 ], in the prospective monitoring of Zika in five countries: Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela, and Martinique. In addition, we evaluate the ability of a collection of multivariable models that use information from these three data sources as input, to dynamically track and forecast the incidence of Zika virus up to 3 weeks ahead of the release of reports from PAHO, using multiple evaluation metrics.    Methods   Epidemiological data  We obtained weekly reports from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) that document the number of laboratory-confirmed and suspected cases of Zika in the Americas from the website ( http://ais.paho.org/phip/viz/ed_zika_epicurve.asp ) and from weekly epidemiological updates[ 39 ]. In the absence of this information, we obtained suspected and lab-confirmed Zika cases from epidemiological bulletins produced by the national Ministries of Health (MOH) of Colombia and Martinique[ 40 , 41 ]. Throughout the manuscript, we refer to these data as “official case count”. Due to the lack of robust diagnostic capabilities across the Americas and the estimated large number of asymptomatic cases[ 4 , 42 ], the present study focuses on predicting suspected Zika cases, which can be used as a proxy for potential hospital visits in each locality. This information could be useful for public health decision-makers when designing resource allocation plans. Under PAHO criteria, cases were classified as suspected if the patient presented a rash and two or more of the following symptoms: fever, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, myalgia, and peri-articular edema[ 43 ]. The time series of suspected cases spans the entire epidemic period of each country, beginning with the earliest reported cases through the last available epidemiologic week in the data (last accessed August 3, 2016). Data profiles for each country can be seen in Table 1 .   10.1371/journal.pntd.0005295.t001  Table 1  Data profile for countries.

We identified the most highly correlated terms with the time evolution of Zika incidence in Colombia and Venezuela on Google Correlate within the time period of May 2015 to Jan 2016, and used Google Trends to identify search terms related to the term “Zika” for all five countries. The time window for the selection of these terms did not exceed the training period of each model. Because the output of Google Trends and Google Correlate consists of country-specific search terms, these are different for each country. All highly correlated terms to the query “Zika” were selected as model inputs without discrimination, including some potential misspellings of the disease such as “sika” and “sica”. We obtained weekly fractions of all identified Google search terms using the Google Trends website. The selected search terms were used as independent variables in the models and are shown in S1 Table .    Twitter microblogs  We leveraged a custom script to access the free Twitter Public API to collect the maximum allowed number of tweets (up to 1% total Twitter volume) with any geographical coordinates. We then searched these tweets by country, using Twitter’s assigned country code and restricting to tweets in which this parameter was present, for the weekly volume of Twitter micro-blogs containing any of the words “Zika”, “microcephaly”, and “microcefalia”, but only Colombia and Venezuela had relevant Zika-related tweets, within the weeks of the epidemic outbreak, to merit the inclusion of Twitter data in our models. The fraction of tweets containing the Zika-related words when compared to the total number of tweets for each country was computed for every week and used as an independent variable in the models.    HealthMap digital Zika surveillance  We obtained cumulative reported case counts of Zika virus disease in all countries via the HealthMap digital disease surveillance system ( www.healthmap.org ), which reports non-governmental media alerts of infections[ 16 ]. From these alerts, we calculated the weekly incidence of Zika infection for use as an independent variable in the models.    Relationship between cases and Internet-based data  In order to assess whether the selected Google search terms, Twitter microblogs, and HealthMap-reported cases could be useful for weekly prediction of Zika incidence, we computed the Pearson’s correlation between each predictor and the official Zika case count, first for the training period of each country and later for the entire time series. In addition, we evaluated the autocorrelation of the signal itself (as lag-1, lag-2, and lag-3 terms). To determine the optimal linear relationship between the predictors and cases, we applied a series of simple transformations to these data and selected the transformation which produced the highest Pearson’s correlation. The results of this preliminary analysis was used for variable selection and to inform the dynamic transformation of variables process within the model, detailed below.    Models  A collection of multivariable models, inspired by those introduced in the Flu prediction literature[ 30 , 37 ], were considered to estimate and forecast weekly suspected cases of Zika in the aforementioned five countries. These models used as input the weekly Google search frequencies of Zika-related terms, the fraction of Zika-related Twitter microblogs, cumulative Zika case counts as recorded by the HealthMap disease surveillance system, and the available historical official case count data at a given point in time. For consistency and comparability, all models (i) automatically select the most relevant search terms for prediction, (ii) incorporate new information on Zika cases as reports are released every week, and (iii) identify the best functional relationship between each input variable and the outcome variable, every week.  The selection of the most predictive input variables was performed using a penalized LASSO regression approach as described in[ 44 ]. While avoiding the use forward-looking information, we incorporated the most recently available information on Zika cases every week by dynamically expanding the time window of the training set of the models. Finally, at each week, we analyzed whether transforming each input variable would increase its correlation with the output variable. If this were the case, then the transformed value of the input variable producing the highest correlation with case data would be used as input for the model. As more epidemiological information becomes available, this dynamic transformation process allows the model to recursively recalibrate and incorporate changes in the relationships between the input variables and the case count information observed so far. The transformations we considered were not exhaustive and included the log(x), x 2 , and sqrt(x).  In addition to the models that used the aforementioned data streams as input, we built a collection of baseline models for comparison and context. We considered models that only used historical observation of Zika cases to predict cases on the subsequent weeks and models that incorporated information from these various data streams. Given the success of Google search terms in tracking other diseases as observed in [ 27 , 28 ], our models utilized Google search as a central predictor, and we explored the additions of Twitter and HealthMap data for the improvement of model predictions. Specifically, we considered (i) AR: a baseline lag-3 autoregressive model that used only Zika surveillance information from the prior 3 weeks to predict suspected cases, (ii) G+T: a model which used only Google search and Twitter (if available) data for prediction as introduced in[ 33 ] (iii) ARGO+T: a model which used autoregressive information and Google and Twitter (if available) data, adapted from[ 37 ], and (iv) ARGO+TH: a model which combined all data streams (Twitter if available, Google, HealthMap) with lag-3 autoregressive terms. For the two countries (Colombia and Venezuela) which had available Twitter data, we also constructed identical models (ii—iv) without this data source; that is, using Google and HealthMap data only. Our models are described by the following equation     y ^ t =   α t +   ∑ i = 1 N γ i y ( t − i ) +   ∑ j = 1 K β j X j , t + τ T t + η H t +   ε t                   ε t ~ N ( 0 , σ 2 )    where we expand an autoregressive model of lag N with the inclusion of the fraction of Google search frequency X for each term j, the fraction of Twitter volume T, and HealthMap-reported cases H. As described in[ 37 ], autoregressive terms generally help maintain predictions within a reasonable range, while Google and Twitter information help the models to respond more rapidly to sudden changes in the dynamics. Due to the novelty of the Zika outbreak, stationarity was not used as a way to assess the appropriateness of using autoregressive models as a baseline; instead, we relied on the observed high autocorrelation of the signal with recent time lags of case counts and evidence of similar mosquito-borne outbreaks modeling approaches[ 45 , 46 ].  At each week, we used our models to generate predictions for 1, 2, and 3 weeks ahead of current time. To avoid future-looking bias in our predictions, forecasts were made using only the information available to each model at each week t; and for each time horizon our case count estimate was obtained using a different model. For instance, all models with autoregressive terms are restricted, in further week-ahead predictions, from accessing weeks of case data that have not yet occurred relative to week t. Thus, 3-week ahead (t+3) forecasts for model (i) were generated using only the lag-3 term (AR3) of official cases from 3 weeks prior to t+3: that is, using the observed cases available exactly at week t. 1-week ahead (t+1) forecasts for model (i), meanwhile, utilized all three AR1, AR2, and AR3 terms, which contain information on reported cases from the strictly observable weeks t, t-1, and t-2. In other words, data that would be unavailable in real-time for predictions—in our case, data on future infections—are excluded from each model. This same rule applies to models (iii) and (iv), which also include autoregressive information. Reflecting the delay in the release of case reporting, the models do access future weeks (relative to week t of case reporting) of Google searches, Twitter microblogs, and HealthMap-reported cases, since these digital streams are available closer to real-time than are official case data.  All models were trained through the same week in the time series and evaluated over the same time window, although the number of training weeks differed based on the information required in each model. Models containing autoregressive information began training 4 weeks into each epidemic, as opposed to training from the first week of reported cases, in order to necessarily inform the one-, two-, and three-week lag terms. A summary of dates and data used by country is shown in Table 1 .  Models were fit as multiple generalized linear models with the glmnet package[ 47 ] in R v3.2.4[ 48 ], validated using k-fold cross validation, and evaluated for their out-of-sample predictive performance. For each model, we report three evaluation metrics: root mean square error (RMSE), the relative RMSE (rRMSE), and the Pearson correlation of predictions with observed cases, as detailed in[ 32 ]. Equations for each metric can be found in S1 Equations .     Results  In order to evaluate the feasibility of using Zika-related Google searches, Twitter microblogs, HealthMap news reports, and historical official case counts to track Zika, we calculated the Pearson correlation between (a) the observed suspected case counts and each input variable, and (b) the observed suspected case counts and three transformations: log(x), x 2 , and sqrt(x), for each input variable. These transformations were observed to sometimes lead to better correlation values than the original raw variables for different time periods. S1 Fig displays in each country the best transformation of each input variable and suspected Zika case counts. From the multiple panels for each country, it can be seen that at least a subset of these (transformed) variables showed potential to be useful to track Zika. Indeed, correlations ranged from 0.93 to 0.56 in Colombia; 0.90 to 0.18 in Honduras; 0.39 to 0.29 in Venezuela; 0.69 to 0.13 in Martinique; and 0.92 to 0.41 in El Salvador. The lowest-correlation predictors tended to be the lag-3 autoregressive term, HealthMap-reported cases, and non-specific Google search terms like “Virus.”  For each country, we produced out-of-sample predictions for the one, two, and three-week ahead time-horizons with the four models introduced in the previous section. We evaluated models according to the maximum number of data sources available, and thus assessed all models with Twitter data, where available (Colombia and Venezuela). In addition, we evaluated models with and without the inclusion of Twitter data. Plots comparing model predictions with the official Zika case count, by time horizon and country, are shown in Figs 1 – 3 . Table 2 summarizes the out-of-sample predictive performance of the four models for each of the three week-ahead time horizons and for all countries, as captured by the three evaluation metrics. Note that while some model predictions showed high correlation values with official case counts, their predictions showed large discrepancies with the data. As a consequence, we relied on the relative RMSE (rRMSE) to establish the quality of model prediction given the short time span of the outbreaks. The rRMSE provides an estimate of the prediction error relative to the number of true cases observed in each week over the evaluation period, and, from our perspective, allows for better comparisons across models and time horizons. We henceforth judge model performance using this metric.   10.1371/journal.pntd.0005295.g001  Fig 1   Prediction results for (a) Colombia and (b) Honduras.

Based on the rRMSE, models that combined Google (and Twitter data where available) with autoregressive information showed better predictive accuracy for 1-week ahead predictions. Meanwhile, models that only used Google (and Twitter where available) typically performed best for two and three-week ahead predictions.  The ARGO+T or ARGO+TH models outperformed all other models in 1-week forecasts for all countries with the exception of Venezuela and Martinique. In Venezuela and Martinique, the ARGO+T model (rRMSE = 38.8 and 43.0, respectively) slightly underperformed relative to the G+T model (rRMSE = 35.3 and 40.1, respectively), with a difference in rRMSE of about 3 percent points. In Colombia and El Salvador, the difference in rRMSE was less than 2% between the ARGO+TH and the ARGO+T models, with both models improving the rRMSE substantially compared to the G+T model.  In further week-ahead predictions, the Google and Twitter only (G+T) model outperformed models that also incorporated autoregressive information, exhibiting the lowest rRMSE in 3 of 5 countries for 2-week forecasts, and in 4 of 5 countries for 3-week forecasts.  Across models, prediction accuracy decreased as predictions were made further into the future, resulting in increases in rRMSE (and RMSE) and declines in model correlations across time horizons. Of all countries studied, Colombia had the best model performance in each week-ahead horizon for every model, with the exception of 3-week G+T forecasts; of all time horizons, the 1-week ahead predictions performed best in each country and model. In most cases, the autoregressive model over-predicted Zika incidence and underperformed all other models.  S2 Table shows the performance of additional versions of these models (i.e., the ARGO+T model with and without Twitter data). It can be seen that the inclusion of Twitter microblog data into our models improved or was comparable to (within 0.2 rRMSE) the performance of all models lacking Twitter data in Colombia (range of rRMSE reduction: -0.13, 1.6), and of the ARGO+T and ARGO+TH models in Venezuela (range of rRMSE reduction: 8.14, 125.1), for all time horizons. Conversely, incorporating HealthMap digital cases improved the rRMSE by no more than 3.8 points, or 7% (range: 0.06%, 6.8%) across models, time horizons, and countries, but worsened the rRMSE by up to 25.1 points, or 60% (range: 1.4%, 59.8%). The relative predictive power of each variable, as given by their standardized model coefficients, at each week in the out-of-sample predictions, is displayed in a collection of heatmaps in S2 Fig .    Discussion  We have shown that Internet-based data sources can be used to track and forecast estimates of suspected weekly Zika cases, weeks ahead of the publication of official case counts. Models that rely exclusively on Google searches have among the lowest error (rRMSE) of all models, indicating that Google search terms alone have the potential to track Zika cases. The heatmaps shown in S2 Fig confirm that Google search terms have significant predictive power in most countries and time horizons.  In Colombia and Venezuela, where robust Twitter data were available, we found that Twitter improved predictions compared to models that lacked the data source. Meanwhile, though HealthMap news reports have been found to be good estimators of Zika cumulative incidence[ 20 ], the effect of incorporating HealthMap news reports into our models was marginal across countries and generally did not reduce prediction error in any of the weeks-ahead forecasts; where it did reduce prediction error, in El Salvador, it did by less than 2% compared to the next-best model lacking HealthMap data. We noted early evidence of HealthMap’s weak predictive power in its low correlation with official case counts, as shown in S1 Fig . Likewise, the heatmaps of S2 Fig reveal that news reports data generally had low influence in models after the first several weeks of out-of-sample predictions. We noted, however, in a post-hoc analysis, that news of Zika infections were 2–3 weeks delayed with respect to the time when cases had occurred. This fact suggests that in the absence of official case count reports, one may use (a potentially lagged version) of news reports to track Zika activity as found previously by[ 20 ]. In the future, we would expect to improve model predictions by incorporating HealthMap data lagged back in time by 2–3 weeks.  As seen in flu forecasting studies[ 32 ], the quality of predictions decreased as the time horizon of prediction increased. Specifically, for one-week predictions, we found that the model that uses Google (and Twitter where available) combined with autoregressive terms (the ARGO+T model) performs best in most countries, and its performance is better than or comparable to the equivalent model that lacks autoregressive information. Thus, the use of historical case information (autoregressive terms) improves predictions in the near future, a finding that has been documented in prior studies[ 26 , 30 , 37 ]. However, for 2–3 week-ahead predictions, models that use exclusively data from Google and Twitter (G+T), without autoregressive terms, perform best. This is likely because the 2–3 week old official case information is no longer crucial to refine the accuracy of predictions, and changes in Google search and Twitter activity better respond to fluctuations in Zika dynamics. Consequently, relying on historical case data becomes less useful in making predictions further into the future. This is also observed in the low relevance of lag terms in the 2- and 3-week heatmaps of all models ( S2 Fig ). Additionally, as automatically identified by our term selection methodology (LASSO), the predictive power of Google search terms is stronger in 1 week-ahead predictions than in 2 and 3 week-ahead predictions. This can be observed in the heatmaps shown in S2 Fig . This finding confirms the appropriateness of using a real-time hidden Markov process as a modeling framework, as discussed in [ 37 ]. From this perspective, people affected by Zika will search for Zika-related terms when affected by the virus or when they may suspect risk of exposure to it. This population search behavior suggests that monitoring search activity may help track disease incidence. The decreased relevance of search activity in 2 and 3 week-ahead predictions may suggest that autoregressive case count information may have a stronger role in future occurrences.  Our models improve upon prior methodologies[ 32 , 33 , 38 ] that use internet-based data sources to track flu by adding an internal dynamic variable transformation process to reassess the relationship of all input variables with the official Zika case count each week. Indeed, the heatmaps of variable coefficients show that model forecasts depended on an ensemble of terms whose predictive power changed magnitude and direction week by week. Given that Google queries were selected on the basis of their relationship to case data or to the term “Zika” exclusively in the training period, it is likely that these relationships change and perhaps even weaken in later weeks. We thus emphasize the importance the need for dynamic transformation of the input variables to recursively reassess these relationships and readjust predictors to their best linear fit with the data.  Some of the limitations of our approach include, for example, the inherent population biases of Internet search engines and Twitter microblog users. Internet searches patterns may also reflect media coverage and situational awareness that may not coincide with the dynamics of the disease being tracked. Also, different countries and locations frequently have distinct news reporting practices. Local media in regions with endemic mosquito-borne diseases may react differently to outbreaks than regions where these diseases are less frequent. Media attention thus has the potential to dramatically influence our weekly predictions. The dynamic reassessment of the predictive power of each input variable, via LASSO and the dynamic transformation approach discussed earlier, is built in our model to mitigate these events. Terms that may peak during a week of high media attention can be thrown out of the influence of the model for the subsequent week of prediction if their relationship with case count information has weakened. Only the terms with high predictive power are selected by the LASSO. In this way, our models are self-correcting. Nonetheless, we note that since our predictions rely largely on user search and media activity, our work is meaningful only in time periods when the population is aware of the disease; to this point, it has been demonstrated that Zika virus was introduced to Brazil and the Americas at least one year before the epidemic was recognized by health ministries and the public at large[ 49 ].  Another important consideration is the time lag between peaks in Zika virus incidence and microcephaly, of up to 5 months[ 50 , 51 ]. Our models capture search activity surrounding the Zika epidemic, and thus end up using search terms like “microcephaly” as input. These terms may be related to broader awareness of Zika activity. Given the estimated lag, however, evaluating microcephaly-related queries synchronously with cases has the potential to introduce a bias in the model. Further work must explore the effect of lagging these terms compared to our synchronous use of them.  As mentioned in the Methods section, Twitter data was not sufficient for use in the models for all countries. To improve upon this, future work could explore keyword queries that incorporate symptoms of Zika infection. In addition, to increase the total volume of tweets we plan to collect historical data based on these new query strings and explore ways to geocode the data ourselves, instead of relying on the current Twitter-generated subset of tweets with coordinate information.  Another challenge lies in the prediction of very low case numbers. In several weeks of the countries studied, official case counts of Zika fell below 50 suspected cases per week; this is very low relative to the thousands of cases experienced per week at the height of the epidemics. We observe that the quality of predictions decreases during time periods with low case numbers, and the model tends to under-predict cases. Our prediction approaches worked best in locations with highest Zika incidence, independently of Internet penetration. This tendency was also observed in the assessment of the Google Dengue Trends system in[ 38 ][ 45 ].  Limitations on the use of official suspected case counts from PAHO as our prediction goal include under-reporting. Indeed, Zika has been observed to be asymptomatic in at least 80% of infected persons[ 42 ]. As a consequence, our models likely underestimate the true number of Zika infections that exist, while reasonably estimating the actual number of suspected cases that seek medical attention. Unfortunately, no surveillance system has yet reported estimates of asymptomatic Zika infections, and it is unclear whether asymptomatic infections can result in the same consequences of birth and neurological defects as do symptomatic infections.  The predictions of our model should be compared to those of SIR-type models and epidemiologic models that evaluate Zika incidence in the context of important, known drivers of Zika, such as climate and ecological factors. In this paper, we explore whether digital data streams are viable estimators of Zika cases. In future inquiry, we believe that these methods could be incorporated into, and enhance, traditional epidemiologic methods to track the virus.  Given the need of early interventions to curb mosquito-borne disease transmission, our model predictions fill a critical time-gap in existing Zika surveillance since official case count reports will, most likely, continue being published multiple weeks after the occurrence of Zika cases. Moreover, access to real-time and likely future estimates of Zika activity provide an opportunity for health and government officials to allocate resources differently when potential changes in Zika dynamics are likely to occur, even ahead of official case documentation. The models presented here show promise to be expanded to any country at any time to track Zika cases and signal changes in transmission for public health decision-makers. Our models currently predict Zika activity at the country level, which we feel is useful for national decision-makers and surveillance purposes; however, our methodology can be extended to finer spatial units, such as the regional or municipal level. Performing predictions with higher spatial resolution will allow more targeted interventions and allocation of resources to the areas with the greatest projected burden of disease.  To produce these predictions in a publicly available and timely manner, we will work to create a website that displays Zika estimates for multiple countries continuously updated in real-time, similar to content published on www.healthmap.org/flutrends and www.healthmap.org/denguetrends .

Background  Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the causative agent of Japanese encephalitis, the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. JEV transmission cycle involves mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts. The detection of JEV RNA in a pool of Culex pipiens caught in 2010 in Italy raised the concern of a putative emergence of the virus in Europe. We aimed to study the vector competence of European mosquito populations, such as Cx . pipiens and Aedes albopictus for JEV genotypes 3 and 5.    Findings  After oral feeding on an infectious blood meal, mosquitoes were dissected at various times post-virus exposure. We found that the peak for JEV infection and transmission was between 11 and 13 days post-virus exposure. We observed a faster dissemination of both JEV genotypes in Ae . albopictus mosquitoes, when compared with Cx . pipiens mosquitoes. We also dissected salivary glands and collected saliva from infected mosquitoes and showed that Ae . albopictus mosquitoes transmitted JEV earlier than Cx . pipiens . The virus collected from Ae . albopictus and Cx . pipiens saliva was competent at causing pathogenesis in a mouse model for JEV infection. Using this model, we found that mosquito saliva or salivary glands did not enhance the severity of the disease.    Conclusions  In this study, we demonstrated that European populations of Ae . albopictus and Cx . pipiens were efficient vectors for JEV transmission. Susceptible vertebrate species that develop high viremia are an obligatory part of the JEV transmission cycle. This study highlights the need to investigate the susceptibility of potential JEV reservoir hosts in Europe, notably amongst swine populations and local water birds.     Author Summary  Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. JEV is maintained in a cycle involving mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, mainly pigs and wading birds. Humans can be infected when bitten by an infected mosquito. Culex tritaeniorhynchus is the main vector of the disease in tropical and subtropical areas. The recent detection of JEV in birds and mosquitoes collected in Northern Italy has led us to evaluate the putative emergence of this arboviral disease in Europe. For this purpose, we have tested the competence of European populations of Cx . pipiens and Aedes albopictus to transmit this virus in a laboratory setting. We showed that these local mosquitoes could be infected and were capable of transmitting a pathogenic virus to mice. It is thus urgent to evaluate the risks of JEV emergence in European regions displaying a favorable environment for mosquito vectors, susceptible pigs and wading birds.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963  Seventh Framework Programme    278433-PREDEMICS   The research leading to these results and MdW received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Program for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant Agreement no 278433-PREDEMICS. website: http://predemics.biomedtrain.eu , European Commission CORDIS: http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/55956_en.html The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Up to 30% of the symptomatic cases are fatal, and long-term neurologic sequelae can occur in 30 to 50% of survivors [ 2 ]. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the causative agent of Japanese encephalitis, and is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. JEV is a member of the Flavivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family and has a positive-sense RNA genome. The viral polyprotein is processed into 10 proteins: three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. JEV strains can be differentiated into five genotypes (1 to 5) based on phylogenetic studies of the viral envelope protein sequences. Until recently, most of the strains of JEV at the origin of major epidemics in the South, East and Southeast Asia regions belonged to genotype 3 [ 3 , 4 ]. Recently a shift in prevalence from JEV genotype 3 to 1 has been observed in several Asian countries [ 5 – 7 ]. JEV genotype 5 was first isolated in Malaysia in 1952, and is genetically and serologically distinct from other genotypes [ 8 – 10 ]. No other JEV genotype 5 strain had been identified until its recent isolation from Culex spp. mosquito pools in China in 2009 [ 11 ] and in South Korea in 2010 and 2012 [ 12 , 13 ].  Most of the vectors for JEV belong to the Culicinae subfamily in the Culicidae family. In most Asian countries, the main vector is Culex tritaeniorhynchus [ 7 , 14 – 18 ], while Cx . annulirostris was identified as the main vector for JEV transmission in Australia [ 19 , 20 ]. Several secondary vectors are known to efficiently transmit JEV: Cx . annulirostris , Cx . annulus , Cx . fuscocephala , Cx . gelidus , Cx . sitiens or Cx . vishnui . The fact that JEV can be detected in field-caught mosquitoes belonging to numerous species, such as Cx . pipiens [ 12 , 17 , 21 ], Aedes albopictus [ 7 , 22 ], or Anopheles species [ 7 , 23 ], poses the question if those mosquito species could also act as secondary vectors for JEV.  The JEV enzootic cycle involves mosquitoes and amplifying vertebrate hosts, such as water birds and domestic swine [ 24 ]. Humans are considered as dead-end hosts, while they can be infected by JEV, they do not develop high levels of blood viremia, and thus cannot infect mosquitoes [ 25 ].  A fragment of JEV genome was detected in a pool of Cx . pipiens and in birds caught in 2000 and 2010 in Northern Italy [ 21 , 26 ] raising the threat of a putative emergence of the virus in Europe [ 27 ]. Recent studies have shown that Ae . detritus from England and Ae . japonicus japonicus from Germany were competent to transmit JEV [ 28 , 29 ]. These observations emphasize on the need to study the vector competence of European mosquito populations for JEV. Ae . albopictus is currently expanding its range, predominantly in temperate areas in North America and Europe, and this invasion raises a public health threat for pathogens transmitted by this vector, such as Zika and dengue viruses. Cx . pipiens is the most widely distributed species of mosquito in the world, and is typically found in temperate regions. Cx . pipiens complex mosquitoes play important roles in the transmission of several medically relevant pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV), Saint Louis encephalitis virus, and filarial worms [ 30 – 32 ].  In the present study, we evaluated the competence of Ae . albopictus and Cx . pipiens populations collected in the South of France for two representative strains of JEV, belonging to distinct genotypes. We found that both viruses could infect and disseminate to high efficiency in either vector and could be readily transmitted. We additionally evaluated the influence of mosquito salivary factors on viral pathogenesis and showed that they had no impact on the development of Japanese encephalitis in a mouse model for the disease. Overall, these findings highlight the need for investigation of the other factors that could contribute to JEV emergence in Europe.    Methods   Ethics statement  The protocols and subsequent experiments were ethically approved by the Ethic Committee for Control of Experiments on Animals (CETEA) at the Institut Pasteur and declared to the French Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche (n° 000762.1) in accordance with European regulations. Experiments were conducted following the guidelines of the Office Laboratory of Animal Care at the Institut Pasteur. Euthanasia was performed by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation. Anesthesia was performed by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Xylazine (Rompun, 5 to 10 mg/kg) and Kétamine (Imalgène, 80 to 100 mg/kg).    Mosquito rearing  Cx . pipiens form pipiens and Ae . albopictus mosquito colonies were established in the laboratory using mosquitoes collected in Montpellier and Nice, in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Eggs of each mosquito colony were hatched in tap water. Larvae were reared in plastic trays containing tap water supplemented with brewer’s yeast tablets and cat food. Adults were maintained at 27°C, 80% relative humidity with a 12 h:12 h light: dark cycle and were given continuous access to 10% sucrose solution.    Cells  Mosquito Ae . albopictus C6/36 cells were maintained at 28°C in Leibovitz medium (L15) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Baby hamster kidney-derived BHK-21 (purchased from ATCC), chicken fibroblast-derived DF-1 (obtained from Nadia Naffakh), and human kidney-derived HEK293T cells (purchased from ATCC) were maintained at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.    Antibodies  Mouse hybridomas producing the monoclonal antibody 4G2 anti-Flavivirus E were purchased from ATCC and a highly purified antibody preparation was produced by RD Biotech. The anti-mosquito saliva antibody was produced in house in rabbits exposed to mosquito bites. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch.    Production of recombinant JEV  A molecular cDNA clone of JEV genotype 3 strain RP-9 was kindly provided by Yi-Lin Ling and was modified as described previously [ 33 ]. A molecular cDNA clone of JEV genotype 5 strain XZ0934 was described previously [ 33 ].  To produce infectious virus, the molecular clones were transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFischer Scientific). At 3 days post-transfection, viral supernatants were collected and used to infect DF-1 cells in order to grow final virus stocks for experiments.    Virus infections  For infections, C6/36 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates in L15, supplemented with 2% FBS. Aliquots of virus were diluted in 200 μl of medium and added to the cells. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 28°C. Unadsorbed virus was removed by two washes with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and then 1 ml of L15 supplemented with 2% FBS was added to the cells, followed by incubation at 28°C until collection.    Focus forming assay (FFA)  BHK-21 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Tenfold dilutions of virus samples were prepared in duplicate in DMEM and 200 μl of each dilution was added to the cells. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Unadsorbed virus was removed, after which 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and antifungals, 1.6% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), 10 mM HEPES buffer, 72 mM sodium bicarbonate, and 2% FBS was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37°C for 32 h. The CMC overlay was aspirated, and the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X100 for 5 min. After fixation, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-E antibody (4G2), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. The assays were developed with the Vector VIP peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The viral titers were expressed as focus forming units (FFU)/ml.    Oral infection of mosquitoes and dissections  Seven day-old female mosquitoes were deprived of sucrose 24 h prior to the infectious blood meal. They were then allowed to feed for 2 h on blood-soaked cotton pledgets in the dark at 28°C. The infectious blood meal was comprised of washed rabbit erythrocytes (obtained from animals housed at the Institut Pasteur animal facility), viral suspension, and ATP (as a phagostimulant) at a final concentration of 5 μM. The virus titer in the blood meal was adjusted to 8 x 10 6 FFU/ml. Blood-fed females were sorted and transferred into cardboard containers covered with mosquito nets. After exposure, engorged mosquitoes were maintained at 26°C, 80% relative humidity, with a 10 h: 10 h light: dark cycle with simulation of dawn and sunset during 2 h. Mosquitoes were dissected at various time points after oral exposure. For titrations, the mosquitoes or individual organs were collected in a tube containing 0.5 mm glass beads and 300 μl of DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. The organs were ground for 30 sec at maximum speed, using a Minilystissue homogeneizer (Bertin) and stored at -80°C until analysis. Experiments were reproduced twice with 5 to 10 mosquitoes collected at each time point for dissection.    Mosquito salivation  JEV exposed mosquitoes were anesthetized at 4°C, legs and wings were removed and the bodies were attached to a glass slide using double-sided tape. The proboscis was manually inserted into a 10 μl low binding pipette tip filled with 10 μl DMEM containing 2% FBS. The tip contents were collected 30 min later in a tube. Two μl were transferred to a tube containing 2 μl SDS sample buffer and analyzed by dot-blot to verify the presence of saliva. Four μl were analyzed by FFA to determine virus titer. Ten to 20 mosquitoes were analyzed for each time point (days 11, 12 and 13 post-virus exposure) and experiments were reproduced twice.    Salivary gland extracts preparation  Five days after emerging, mosquito females were blood-fed on mice previously anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Xylazine (5 to 10 mg/kg) and Ketamine (80 to 100 mg/kg). Three weeks later, 100 salivary glands (SG) were dissected and placed in 100 μl 1X PBS. SG extracts were prepared by sonicating the SG (five times at 4 min each with a pulse ratio of 2 sec on / 2 sec off) and centrifuging the crude extract at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to clean tubes and stored at −80°C. The inocula used in our experiments contained the equivalent to a pair of SG.    Western blotting  Protein lysates were prepared by cell lysis in radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Bio Basic) containing protease inhibitors (Roche). Equal amounts of proteins were loaded on a NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gel (ThermoFisher Scientific) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). After blocking the membrane for 1 h at room temperature in PBS-Tween (PBS-T) plus 5% milk, the blot was incubated overnight at 4°C with appropriate dilutions of the primary antibodies. The membrane was then washed in PBS-T and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. After washes in PBS-T, the membrane was developed using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific) and exposed to film.    Dot-blot on mosquito saliva  The saliva collected from each mosquito was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Two μl of DMEM containing 2% FBS and 1 μg of mosquito salivary gland extract were deposited on the membrane as negative and positive controls, respectively. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS-T plus 5% milk and incubated overnight at 4°C with an anti-mosquito saliva antibody. The blots were then processed as indicated above for Western blotting.    Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA)  After dissection, midguts (MG) and salivary glands (SG) were placed on slides and the PBS removed. MG were fixed in acetone for 15 min. SG were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Both slides were dried and stored at 4°C until use. The MG and SG were then rehydrated in PBS for 15 min. The MG and the SG were incubated in Triton X100 (0.2%) for 2 h and 15 min, respectively. They were then washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 containing 1% BSA. The slides were drained and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-flavivirus protein E 4G2 antibody diluted in PBS, then washed with PBS. The slides were next incubated for 1 h with a fluorophore conjugated antibody, and washed with PBS. After washing, a drop of ProLong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific) was placed on each slide and a cover slide was added. All preparations were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan 2 Imaging, Zeiss).    Mice experiments  Three-week-old female BALB/c mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions at the Institut Pasteur animal facility. Groups of mice were anesthetized as described above, and were next intradermally inoculated with 50 FFU of JEV genotype 5 in absence or in presence of salivary gland extract or with JEV-infected saliva diluted in 100 μl of DPBS supplemented with 0.2% endotoxin-free serum albumin.    Statistical analysis  An unpaired t test was used to compare quantitative data, and a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to compare survival data. GraphPad Prism was used for all statistical analysis.    Animal handling  Rabbit and mice were housed in Institut Pasteur animal facilities.     Results   Vector competence of European strains of mosquitoes for JEV  To assess the vector competence of European mosquitoes for JEV, we decided to use two molecular clones of viruses (RP-9 and XZ0934), which are representative of two currently circulating genotypes. The well-characterized genotype 3 strain, JEV RP-9, was isolated from Cx . tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes in Taiwan in 1985 [ 34 , 35 ], while the genotype 5 strain, JEV-XZ0934, was recently isolated from Cx . tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes in China in 2009 [ 11 ]. For simplification, JEV-RP-9 and JEV-XZ0934 will be hereafter referred to as JEV g3 and JEV g5, respectively. Both viruses were produced by transfection of cDNA into mammalian cells, as previously described [ 33 ], followed by amplification of viral stocks in chicken fibroblasts DF-1 cells. Those viruses displayed comparable growth after infection of Ae . albopictus derived C6/36 cells ( Fig 1 , [ 33 ]).   10.1371/journal.pntd.0005294.g001  Fig 1   Kinetics of JEV g3 and g5 infection in vitro .  Ae . albopictus derived C6/36 cells were infected with JEV g3 or g5 at a MOI of 1. The infectious virus released to the supernatants at 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection was quantified by FFA in BHK-21 cells. The error bars represent the standard deviation between two independent experiments (in each experiment, titrations were done on duplicate experimental samples). FFU, focus forming units.     To evaluate the vector competence of European mosquito species for JEV, we exposed mosquitoes to either JEV g3 or JEV g5 by feeding on blood meals containing approximately 8 x 10 6 FFU of virus per ml. We note that the viremia in infected pigs or in birds can reach up to 10 7 PFU/ml, but is on average 10 4 PFU/ml [ 36 – 41 ]. While we offered blood meals that contained relatively high levels of virus, it is generally accepted that a greater quantity of virus is needed to infect mosquitoes orally with artificial mixtures than with viremic hosts [ 42 ]. For each experiment, 3 blood-fed mosquitoes were harvested immediately post-virus exposure, and the ingested virus titers were evaluated by FFA. The amount of ingested infectious virus was comprised between 400 and 9,000 FFU per mosquito, with an average titer of 4,000 FFU.  Previous studies on vector competence of various species of mosquitoes for JEV have shown the peak for JEV infection and transmission occurs between 5 and 23 days after peroral infection [ 23 , 29 , 43 – 48 ]. Our preliminary studies showed that, under our experimental conditions, the majority of Cx . pipiens and Ae . albopictus were infected from 10 to 15 days post-virus exposure. We chose to focus collection times around the peak of viral transmission and harvested samples at 7, 11, 12 and 13 days post-virus exposure. We note that the survival rate of exposed mosquitoes dropped considerably after 2 weeks of infection, and consequently did not analyze the levels of mosquito infection beyond this point.  First, we determined the infection rates in Ae . albopictus ( Fig 2A ) and Cx . pipiens ( Fig 2B ) mosquitoes by titrating the midguts harvested from mosquitoes. Next, we measured the levels of JEV infection in the heads of infected mosquitoes, and calculated infected dissemination rates ( Fig 2C and 2D ). We did not observe any statistically significant differences in infection rates amongst genotypes for each mosquito species or by time after the infectious blood meal. We did note that dissemination of JEV was faster in Ae . albopictus mosquitoes, when compared with Cx . pipiens mosquitoes. Notably, at 7 days post-virus exposure, we found that 57 to 90% of Ae . albopictus mosquitoes were systemically infected, whereas only 26 to 36% of Cx . pipiens were ( Fig 2C and 2D ). Last, we determined transmission rates through titration of saliva collected from blood-fed mosquitoes ( Fig 2E and 2F ). While this is a method widely used to determined transmission rates, we observed that salivation assays are highly dependent on salivation efficiency, and that the levels of virus in saliva can sometimes be below the detection limit of our titration assay. Keeping in mind that this determination of the virus transmission rates has limitations, we observed that both mosquito species transmitted JEV at rates ranging from 20 to 63% for Ae . albopictus , and from 12 to 41% for Cx . pipiens ( Fig 2E and 2F ).   10.1371/journal.pntd.0005294.g002  Fig 2   Vector competence of European strains of mosquitoes for two different JEV genotypes following feeding on infectious bloodmeals.  Infection rates in Ae . albopictus (A) or Cx . pipiens (B) mosquitoes exposed to either JEV g3 or JEV g5 by feeding on blood meals containing 8 x 10 6 FFU/ml of virus. The infection rates were determined after titration of midguts harvested from mosquitoes on days 7, 11, 12 and 13 post-virus exposure. The infected dissemination rates (C and D) were calculated by titration of the heads of infected mosquitoes. The transmission rates (E and F) were calculated by titration of the saliva collected from all blood-fed mosquitoes. The error bars represent the standard deviation between two independent experiments. The number of mosquitoes analyzed for each condition is indicated below each graph bar. An unpaired t test was employed to determine significant differences between JEV genotypes at each time point. No statistically significant differences were found (P≥0.08). n.d. not determined.       Characterization of JEV infection in European strains of mosquitoes  Next, we analyzed the levels of JEV g3 and g5 accumulation in the different mosquito organs that had been harvested ( Fig 3 ). We noted that JEV levels in the midguts slowly decreased between 7 and 13 days post-virus exposure, while viral levels in heads and salivary glands increased over time, which is consistent with patterns of viral dissemination in mosquitoes. We noted that at 7 days post-virus exposure, the rates of salivary glands infection ranged from 40 to 80% for Ae . albopictus , and from 5 to 9% for Cx . pipiens . Viral infection of salivary glands has been shown to correlate well with infection of saliva [ 43 ], and thus we hypothesize that Ae . albopictus mosquitoes were likely to transmit JEV at earlier times than Cx pipiens . Interestingly, in Ae . albopictus mosquitoes midguts, we observed a significant difference in the titers of JEV g5 when compared to JEV g3 titers ( Fig 3A ). Notably, it appeared that JEV g5 accumulated to higher levels than JEV g3 at 7 days post-virus exposure, and to lesser levels at later infection times (11 to 13 days post-virus exposure).   10.1371/journal.pntd.0005294.g003  Fig 3   Kinetics of JEV infection in European strains of Ae . albopictus and Cx . pipiens mosquitoes.  Ae . albopictus (A, B and C) or Cx . pipiens (D, E and F) mosquitoes were exposed to either JEV g3 or JEV g5 by feeding on blood meals containing 8 x 10 6 FFU/ml of virus. At 7, 11, 12 and 13 days post-virus exposure, the midguts (A and D), heads (B and E) and salivary glands (C and F) were harvested from individual mosquitoes and the levels of infectious virus in each organ was quantified by FFA in BHK-21 cells. The error bars represent the standard deviation amongst infected samples collected from two independent experiments. An unpaired t test was employed to determine significant differences between JEV genotypes at each time point (***, P < 0.001; **, 0.001 < P < 0.01; *, 0.01 < P < 0.05; only statistically significant differences are shown).     Additionally, we analyzed the distribution of JEV envelope protein in the organs of infected mosquitoes ( Fig 4 ). First, we performed immuno-localization within organs harvested from Ae . albopictus mosquitoes at 14 days post-virus exposure, which corresponds to a peak in viral transmission ( Fig 4A ). While envelope protein staining within the midgut was relatively weak, there was a strong staining of numerous cells within both lobes of salivary glands. Samples collected at 11 days post-virus exposure were also analyzed by western blotting and showed good detection of the envelope protein in midguts and salivary glands ( Fig 4B ).   10.1371/journal.pntd.0005294.g004  Fig 4   Analysis of JEV infection in mosquitoes.

Detection of JEV in infected European mosquito saliva  To evaluate the levels of virus secreted in mosquito saliva, we collected mosquitoes at 11, 12 and 13 days post-feeding on an infectious blood meal, and performed forced salivation. Since not all of the mosquitoes salivate when subjected to this assay, we also performed a survey of successful salivation. A fraction of the collected saliva was dotted on a membrane, and was next incubated with an antibody specific for mosquito saliva ( Fig 5A ). We noted that both mosquito species efficiently salivated under our experimental conditions, and that the levels of actual salivation were above 40% for either mosquitoes ( Fig 5A ). The collected saliva was then subjected to a standard infectivity assay to determine the levels of JEV transmitted in JEV-positive saliva at each time point ( Fig 5B and 5C ). We noted that for both mosquito species, higher levels of virus were secreted in saliva at later times post-virus exposure, which mirrored the increase in viral load in salivary glands ( Fig 3C and 3F ). The levels of infectious virus in saliva ranged between 2 and 200 FFU for JEV g3 (45 and 55 FFU in average for Ae . albopictus and Cx . pipiens , respectively), and between 2 and 196 FFU for JEV g5 (38 and 35 FFU in average for Ae . albopictus and Cx . pipiens , respectively).   10.1371/journal.pntd.0005294.g005  Fig 5   Analysis of salivas collected from European mosquitoes infected by different genotypes of JEV.  At 11, 12 and 13 days post-virus exposure, salivas were collected from mosquitoes via forced salivation in pipette tips. A. Individual salivation samples were analyzed in a dot-blot assay using an anti-saliva antibody, to determine the salivation efficiency for each mosquito species. The rates of salivation obtained from two independent salivation assays are given, and a representative dot blot assay is shown. B. and C. The levels of infectious virus in JEV-positive saliva were measured by FFA in BHK-21 cells.       European mosquito saliva or salivary glands do not enhance JEV pathogenesis in a mouse model for JEV disease  Next we assessed whether the virus transmitted by European mosquitoes was capable of developing a productive infection in mammalian hosts. To evaluate this, we used a previously characterized murine model for Japanese encephalitis, based on JEV g5 infection of 3-week-old BALB/c mice [ 33 ]. Three-week-old BALB/c mice were injected via intradermal route with JEV, as this mode of injection most resembles a mosquito bite. First, JEV-positive saliva samples collected from Ae . albopictus and Cx . pipiens mosquitoes ( Fig 5 ) were used as an inocula ( Fig 6A ). Saliva containing various loads of virus was used, with a titer comprised between 7 and 98 FFU. A control group of mice were similarly injected with JEV grown from C6/36 cells, using a single dose of 50 FFU ( Fig 6A ). As expected, the animals rapidly exhibited limb paralysis and encephalitis. We did not observe any significant differences in survival rates amongst the different inocula ( Fig 6A ). The survival rate was between 33 and 40%, with a mean survival time of 11 to 12.5 days.   10.1371/journal.pntd.0005294.g006  Fig 6   Effect of mosquito saliva and salivary glands on JEV infection in a mouse model.  Groups of 3-week-old BALB/c mice were monitored for survival after intradermal injection with JEV g5 ( n = 6 per group). A. Mice were injected with JEV-positive saliva collected from infected mosquitoes. The levels of virus in saliva were between 7 and 98 FFU ( Ae . albopictus : 9, 15, 22, 28, 60 and 70 FFU; Cx . pipiens : 7, 16, 24, 30, 51 and 98 FFU). Control mice were injected with 50 FFU of virus grown in C6/36 cells (C6/36 supernatants). B. Mice were injected with 50 FFU of virus, in presence or absence of one pair of salivary glands (SGP) harvested from either Ae . albopictus or Cx . pipiens mosquitoes. A Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was employed to determine significant differences between inocula . No statistically significant differences were found (P≥0.6).     The detection of JEV-specific antibodies showed that all surviving mice had been exposed to the virus ( S1 Fig ).  Since it was shown that mosquitoes can inject salivary components that influence the outcome of viral infection [ 49 – 51 ], we next evaluated the impact of European mosquito salivary glands on JEV pathogenesis in a murine model. As described above, we used the intradermal route to inject 50 FFU of JEV g5 to 3-week-old BALB/c mice ( Fig 6B ). For two groups of mice, the inoculum was mixed with salivary glands extracts obtained from Ae . albopictus or Cx . pipiens mosquitoes. In accordance with what was previously observed after injection of saliva collected from infected mosquitoes, we did not observe any significant difference in the development of JEV pathogenesis in presence of mosquito salivary glands ( Fig 6B ). Overall these experiments show that European mosquitoes are fully competent at transmitting infectious JEV, but that saliva does not facilitate the development of viral pathogenesis in a susceptible murine model.     Discussion  In recent years, the increase in locally acquired exotic arbovirus diseases in Europe can be linked to the presence of appropriate combinations of vectors and vertebrate hosts, which could ultimately lead to the establishment of these diseases in Europe [ 52 – 54 ]. Since 2010, sporadic cases of locally acquired chikungunya and dengue fevers have been noted in Europe [ 55 , 56 ]. The driving forces behind these events are viraemic travelers and the increasing presence of competent vector species, such as Ae . aegypti and Ae . albopictus , in temperate regions. Likewise, the circulation of WNV and Usutu virus–two Flaviviruses —was reported in 10 European countries [ 57 ]. Two studies in Italy reported the infection of local Cx . pipiens populations with both WNV and Usutu virus [ 58 , 59 ] and there is an increase in WNV disease incidence in Europe [ 60 ]. While JEV RNA was recently detected in mosquitoes and birds in Northern Italy [ 21 , 26 ], to date, human infections with JEV were only reported in travelers returning from endemic countries [ 61 – 63 ].  Our study shows for the first time that European strains of Cx . pipiens and Ae . albopictus are both competent vectors to transmit two genotypes (3 and 5) of JEV. High levels of infection, dissemination and transmission rates were observed in both vectors for either genotypes after oral exposure of mosquitoes to a blood meal containing virus at 8 x 10 6 FFU/ml. In the present study, we did not evaluate vector competence for viral strains belonging to the genotype 1. Strains belonging to this genotype have displaced the prevalent genotype 3 in several countries in recent years [ 5 – 7 ]. Genotype 1 and 3 strains are genetically close when compared to the more distant genotype 5 strains [ 8 – 10 ]. Since we observed equivalent vector competence of European mosquitoes for genotypes 3 and 5, we hypothesize that those mosquitoes will also be competent at transmitting genotype 1 viruses.  Several mosquitoes from the Culex genus are established vectors for JEV. Cx . tritaeniorhynchus is the main vector in the enzootic cycle of JEV in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. Interestingly, the vector competence of a Cx . pipiens molestus population from Taiwan was found to be similar to that of Cx . tritaeniorhynchus , when tested in laboratory conditions [ 46 ], which is in line with our observations. Other investigators reported that Cx . pipiens populations from other world regions ( Cx . pipiens molestus from Uzbekistan, Cx . pipiens pallens from Korea, Cx . pipiens from the United States of America) were less susceptible to JEV and were not always capable of transmitting the virus [ 50 , 64 ]. Of note, there has been some reports of isolation of JEV from field-caught mosquitoes along the years [ 12 , 17 , 21 , 65 ], and all strains of JEV isolated from Cx . pipiens mosquitoes in Korea in 2012 belonged to the genotype 5 [ 12 ]. As strains belonging to the genotype 5 were only rarely isolated, one can wonder if the transmission cycles that are involved in the maintenance of those viruses involve mosquito and amplifying host species different from the established Cx . tritaeniorhynchus / swine model. Since the currently available vaccines do not confer full protection against JEV genotype 5 strains [ 66 , 67 ], the risks of JEV g5 transmission to human populations must be carefully examined.  Similarly to Cx . pipiens , field-collected Ae . albopictus mosquitoes were occasionally found positive for JEV [ 22 , 68 ]. Various transmission rates were observed in laboratory settings, from less than 17% for Australian populations [ 69 ] to 45% for Taiwanese populations [ 22 ]. In our experiments, European Ae . albopictus was also able to transmit different strains of JEV to high efficiency, which supports the hypothesis that European mosquito populations belonging to these two species have a better vector competence for JEV than populations isolated in other parts of the world.  Our results also showed that the extrinsic incubation period (i.e. the time between ingestion of the virus and the ability of the mosquito to become infectious) for JEV is shorter in Ae . albopictus than in Cx . pipiens . We have not performed a formal analysis of the relative life span of our mosquito populations after ingestion of an infectious blood meal. If we assume that both mosquito species have similar life spans, then this would imply that Ae . albopictus mosquitoes can transmit JEV for a longer period than the French population of Cx . pipiens and therefore might be a more efficient vector. Specifically, host biting preferences may have consequences on the emergence of the disease in Europe and its transmission dynamics. Arbovirus circulation is defined by many aspects including the population dynamics of the mosquito vector, the extrinsic incubation period, and the population densities of the vertebrate amplifying hosts, all of which are influenced by environmental factors. In the case of JEV, the classic Cx . tritaeniorhynchus –pig transmission cycle was observed in Japan, a region of high pig farming density, but other species and scenarios could be invoked in regions where pig farming is less abundant, or where Cx . tritaeniorhynchus is not found [ 70 ]. An example of this is the 1995 outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Australia that involved the presence of domestic pigs and high populations of Cx . annulirostris [ 19 , 20 ]. Ae . albopictus is considered to be an opportunistic feeder: it primarily feeds on mammalian hosts (humans, wild and domestic animals) but can also acquire blood from avian sources [ 71 , 72 ]. Analysis of feeding patterns in temperate regions showed that populations of Ae . albopictus in the United States of America mainly fed on mammals and rarely on birds [ 73 ]. Cx . pipiens mosquitoes feed mostly on birds (83%) but also on mammals [ 74 ]. Interestingly, it was shown that 20% of Cx . pipiens emerging from diapause in temperate habitats fed on mammals [ 73 ]. Considering the natural cycle of JEV implying birds as reservoir and pigs as amplifying hosts, specificity in host preferences may have consequences on the possible emergence of the disease in Europe and its transmission dynamics. Favorable conditions for JEV emergence may be gathered in several places in Europe where pig breeding sites, bird sanctuaries and Ae . albopictus and/or Cx . pipiens mosquitoes coexist (Marquenterre parc, Baie de Somme, France; Camargue, Rhone delta, France; Danube delta, Roumania).  The last part of our study was to investigate the role of mosquito saliva in the transmission of JEV to mice. When insects take a blood meal, they trigger defensive responses from the vertebrate, such as hemostasis and various immune responses. The saliva proteins injected by the mosquito can counteract these defenses, through their angiogenic, anti-hemostatic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties [ 75 ]. This complex interaction may significantly affect the evolution of the disease; notably co-injection of virus and saliva was shown to potentiate infection of the vertebrate host by arboviruses belonging to various families [ 49 – 51 , 76 , 77 ]. While we did not observe any enhancement of Japanese encephalitis disease in mice, in presence of salivary gland extract or of saliva collected from either European vectors, further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of saliva on viral burden in different organs. Additionally, we cannot exclude the possibility that JEV pathogenesis might be enhanced by salivary factors of other mosquito species, or that saliva from the two species tested in the present study might enhance pathogenicity in other mammalian species.    Conclusion  In this study, we have clearly demonstrated that European populations of Ae . albopictus and Cx . pipiens were efficient vectors for JEV transmission. Conditions for a putative emergence of JEV in Europe are linked to the possibility for an enzootic cycle to take place in temperate areas. In order to complete the infection cycle, JEV must be transmitted to a susceptible vertebrate host, capable of producing sufficient viral titers for subsequent acquisition by the insect vector. It is therefore important to further investigate whether any European swine or water birds populations can be infected with JEV and produce sufficiently high viremias to infect mosquitoes that feed on them. Such knowledge is critical to assess the potential for JEV to establish local transmission cycles similar to the closely related WNV in Northern Italy.

The Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen that produces significant morbidity and mortality. To explore the contribution of alveolar macrophages (AlvMΦs) in regulating the severity of IAV infection we employed a murine model in which the Core Binding Factor Beta gene is conditionally disrupted in myeloid cells. These mice exhibit a selective deficiency in AlvMΦs. Following IAV infection these AlvMΦ deficient mice developed severe diffuse alveolar damage, lethal respiratory compromise, and consequent lethality. Lethal injury in these mice resulted from increased infection of their Type-1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells (T1AECs) and the subsequent elimination of the infected T1AECs by the adaptive immune T cell response. Further analysis indicated AlvMΦ-mediated suppression of the cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) pathway genes in T1AECs in vivo and in vitro . Inhibition of the cysLT pathway enzymes in a T1AECs cell line reduced the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection, suggesting that AlvMΦ-mediated suppression of this pathway contributes to the resistance of T1AECs to IAV infection. Furthermore, inhibition of the cysLT pathway enzymes, as well as blockade of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptors in the AlvMΦ deficient mice reduced the susceptibility of their T1AECs to IAV infection and protected these mice from lethal infection. These results suggest that AlvMΦs may utilize a previously unappreciated mechanism to protect T1AECs against IAV infection, and thereby reduce the severity of infection. The findings further suggest that the cysLT pathway and the receptors for cysLT metabolites represent potential therapeutic targets in severe IAV infection.    Author Summary  A primary feature of lethal influenza infection is viral pneumonia. Influenza viral pneumonia is caused by the direct infection of alveolar epithelial cells, which subsequently causes extensive alveolar inflammation and injury. Clinically this pathology manifests as diffuse alveolar damage leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. As alveolar macrophages are positioned in the alveoli, they are the ideally localized to be a first-line of defense against alveolar invading pathogens, such as influenza. To explore the contribution of alveolar macrophages to the development of lethal influenza pneumonia, we generated a novel mouse model with a selective deficiency in alveolar macrophages. As a result of the alveolar macrophage deficiency, these mice developed severe diffuse alveolar damage and lethal respiratory compromise after influenza infection. Lethal injury resulted from increased infection of type-1 alveolar epithelial cells, and the elimination of these infected cells by effector T cells. Further analysis indicated that in order to render type 1 cells resistant to influenza infection, alveolar macrophages suppress leukotrieneD4 production and autocrine-signaling in type 1 cells. These results suggest that alveolar macrophages play a previously unappreciated role in protecting type 1 alveolar epithelial cells against IAV infection, and thus the severity of infection.

In the United States alone, IAV infections are associated with more than 20,000 deaths and 300,000 hospitalizations annually [ 1 ]. IAV is a negative sense RNA virus that is transmitted by aerosol and fomites [ 2 ]. Upon inhalation, IAV primarily infects and replicates in respiratory epithelial cells. After completion of the replication cycle the newly formed virions are released apically from the infected cells back into the pulmonary airspaces, allowing the virions to reach the more distal cells of the respiratory tract as the infection evolves [ 3 ].  Eventually the infectious IAV virions reach the terminal airways, which are lined by type 1 and type 2 AECs (T1 and T2AEC). As T1AECs are responsible for gas exchange, extensive infection and the subsequent elimination of these cells can lead to severe pulmonary compromise [ 4 , 5 ]. In the murine model of IAV infection, one of the prominent differences between infection with highly pathogenic IAV strains and strains producing limited morbidity and mortality, is the degree to which T1AECs become infected and are subsequently eliminated [ 6 , 7 ]. Furthermore, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), defined by the presence of fibrin deposition and alveolar hyaline membrane formation, as well as viral infection of alveolar epithelial cells are frequently found in autopsies of severe clinical IAV infection [ 4 , 8 ]. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the degree of alveolar epithelium infection by IAV, and the extent of the resulting injury, is one the many crucial regulators of the outcome of IAV infection.  Recently, several reports have implicated the lung resident alveolar macrophages (AlvMΦs) as critical modulators of IAV disease severity and the development of lethal pulmonary injury [ 9 – 12 ]. However, the mechanism(s) by which AlvMΦs influence the outcome of IAV infection has yet to be clearly determined, although an inability to clear cellular debris and exudates has been implicated. AlvMΦs are classically thought to be negative immune regulators and thereby inhibit inflammatory responses to harmless inhaled antigens [ 13 ]. Conversely, their location within the terminal airways also suggests that AlvMΦs are one of the first innate immune cell types to encounter any inhaled potentially harmful microbes. Therefore, AlvMΦs are also believed to be an important initiator of the inflammatory response during bacterial infections, making them an important first line of defense against lower respiratory tract infection [ 14 ]. In the clinical setting, AlvMΦ dysfunction has been observed in multiple disease settings including asthma, allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, smoking related lung disease, and, in the complete absence of AlvMΦs, the development of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [ 15 – 19 ].  While screening mice that had genes linked to myeloid lineage development knocked out specifically in myeloid cells, we identified a mouse model in which there was a cellular deficiency selectively in the AlvMΦ compartment. In this mouse model the expression of Core Binding Factor Beta (CBFβ), which regulates the activity of the Runx family of transcription factors essential for myelopoiesis, is selectively knocked out in myeloid cells expressing Lysozyme M (LysM). This was accomplished by crossing CBFβ floxed mice with mice that express Cre recombinase driven off of the LysM promoter (CBFβ ΔLysM ) [ 20 , 21 ]. As a consequence of CBFβ gene disruption, these mice exhibit a deficiency in AlvMΦs without detectable consequences in the number or function of other LysM expressing cells in the lung and spleen, thereby allowing us to better define and elucidate the mechanisms by which AlvMΦs regulate the outcome of influenza infection.  We report here that the AlvMΦ deficient CBFβ ΔLysM mice are highly susceptible to lethal IAV infection. With the exception of their markedly reduced number of AlvMΦs, CBFβ ΔLysM mice exhibit no deficiency in innate or adaptive immune cells in the lungs prior to or following IAV infection. The AlvMΦ deficiency did result in a marked increase in susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection, resulting in the development of DAD and lethal injury following infection. Indeed, a precipitous decline in respiratory function and development of lethal injury in these AlvMΦ deficient mice was associated with the onset of the adaptive immune response in the infected lungs, and immune mediated elimination of the infected T1AECs.  We further demonstrate that the AlvMΦ-conferred T1AEC resistance to IAV infection was associated with the suppression of the genes for enzymes involved in the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) to cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) pathway in T1AECs from infected lungs. Consistent with a role for AlvMΦs in regulating the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection through control of the cysLT pathway, blockade/knockdown of cysLT pathway enzymes in T1AECs in vitro or antagonism of the cysLT pathway and the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 in vivo reduced the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection and rendered the AlvMΦ deficient CBFβ ΔLysM mice resistant to lethal IAV infection.    Results   Characterization of the Conditional CBFβ Deficient Mice  To assess the impact of disruption of the CBFβ gene in the myeloid lineage we examined the outcome of intranasal (i.n.) infection of CBFβ ΔLysM mice and wild type (WT) control CBFβ fl/fl littermates with a sublethal dose (0.1LD 50 ) of the mouse adapted Influenza A strain A/PR/8 [H1N1]. As expected, infected WT mice survived and recovered from this inoculum dose ( Fig 1a ). However, CBFβ ΔLysM mice exhibited markedly reduced survival (> 85% mortality) following infection ( Fig 1a ) suggesting that expression of CBFβ in one or more cell types of the myeloid lineage was critical for recovery from IAV infection.   10.1371/journal.ppat.1006140.g001  Fig 1   Alveolar macrophage deficient CBFβ ΔLysM mice exhibit enhanced mortality after influenza infection.

Since several cell types of myeloid origin are affected by LysM driven Cre-mediated inactivation of the CBFβ gene, we employed the ROSA26 reporter mouse system, which allowed us to identify the cell type(s) responsive to LysM-Cre by Cre driven YFP expression. As Table 1 indicates, both before and after infection, efficient recombination (YFP expression) was primarily restricted to neutrophils and AlvMΦs, each of which displayed greater than 80% LysM-Cre driven recombination. By contrast, inflammatory mononuclear cells and respiratory dendritic cells were only modestly YFP + (~ 20% or less) ( Table 1 ) (Gating strategy S1 Fig ).   10.1371/journal.ppat.1006140.t001  Table 1  Pulmonary YFP expression in LysM-Cre x ROSA26 reporter mice prior to and during IAV infection.

However, published findings indicate that the RUNX TFs are essential early during neutrophil development, but are down regulated just as LysM expression is upregulated [ 22 ]. Therefore, we did not expect pulmonary neutrophil accumulation and function to be significantly impacted by the CBFβ deletion. By contrast, examination of the CD45 + cells in the bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lungs of naïve mice revealed markedly diminished numbers of AlvMΦs (CD45 + , CD11c + , Siglec F + cells) in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice compared to their WT littermate controls (70%-80% reduction in the BAL and 50%-75% in the lung) ( Fig 1b ). In contrast to WT AlvMΦs, which are classically defined as CD11b - , the majority of the small number of AlvMΦs in the CBFβ ΔLysM BAL fluid and lungs were CD11b + , however they still maintained typical macrophage morphology ( Fig 1b and S2a Fig ). Immature AlvMΦs are initially CD11b + , but down regulate CD11b as they mature/differentiate. Therefore, since CBFβ expression supports myeloid lineage development, the small number of CD11b + AlvMΦs could represent cells at an early/intermediary stage in AlvMΦ development/ differentiation [ 23 , 24 ]. Of note, the residual AlvMΦs in naive CBFβ ΔLysM mice were sufficient to prevent the development of alveolar proteinosis as determined by BAL protein concentration and lung histology/morphology ( Fig 1c and S2b Fig ). After IAV infection there was a transient decrease in the number of AlvMΦs in the BAL of WT mice that began to recover by day 7 PI and progressively increased out to day 11 PI. In contrast, the AlvMΦ deficit in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice became even more pronounced over time with few AlvMΦs (CD11b - or CD11b + ) detectable at day 7 PI and beyond ( Fig 1d ).  As expected, we observed no difference between WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice in their lung and BAL accumulation of neutrophils (CD45 + , Siglec F - , CD11b + , Ly6G + cells) before and during IAV infection ( Fig 1e and S2d Fig ). We also detected no difference in cell surface expression of CD107a (a marker of degranulation) or in the magnitude of CD11b expression (which is elevated on activated neutrophils) on pulmonary neutrophils following IAV infection in WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice ( Fig 1f ) [ 25 ]. In summary, these data suggest that, as expected, neutrophil infiltration and function during IAV infection is unaffected in CBFβ ΔLysM mice.  There was also no deficit in the total number of pulmonary interstitial macrophages (CD45 + , Siglec F - , CD11b + , F4/80 + cells) ( Fig 1g ) or respiratory dendritic cells (CD45 + , CD11c + , MHCII + , Siglec F - , B220 - cells, either CD103 + or CD11b + ) ( Fig 1h ) in WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice. LysM driven Cre recombination activity was also detected in a minor fraction of cells making up the heterogeneous population of inflammatory mononuclear cells (IMNCs) ( Table 1 ). The absolute number of IMNCs (CD45 + , CD11b + , Siglec F - , Ly6G - cells) ( Fig 1i and S2e Fig ) and the frequency of IMNCs that express Ly6C ( Fig 1j ) before or during IAV infection were likewise unaffected in CBFβ ΔLysM mice. As there was no difference in IMNC infiltration between wild type and CBFβ ΔLysM mice, CCR2 expression by the mononuclear cells was not further evaluated. Interestingly, we also saw no difference in splenic macrophages, neutrophils, IMNCs and DCs in CBFβ ΔLysM and WT mice ( S2c Fig ). These data suggest that the disruption of CBFβ in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice had only a minimal, if any, effect on the development and effector response of these pulmonary mononuclear cell subsets and the innate immune response to IAV infection.    Characterization of Virus Clearance and the Adaptive Immune Response in IAV Infected CBFβ ΔLysM Mice  In previous reports acute depletion of AlvMΦs prior to IAV infection was shown to result in enhanced virus titers and impaired adaptive T cell responses [ 9 , 11 , 12 ]. In order to determine if the loss of AlvMΦs in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice resulted in uncontrolled virus replication, or had any impact on the IAV adaptive response, we next evaluated virus replication/clearance and the adaptive response in WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice. The CBFβ ΔLysM mice succumbed to infection between days 8 and 15 PI ( Fig 1a ), which are following the characteristic onset of the adaptive immune response and concomitant virus clearance as observed in WT mice [ 26 ]. The tempo of IAV replication and clearance in the lungs was comparable for WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice as determined by BAL fluid virus titers ( Fig 2a ). It is noteworthy that infectious virus was no longer detectable by day 11 PI, when infected CBFβ ΔLysM mice succumbed to infection. Infectious virus clearance was also confirmed by the analysis of viral gene expression in whole lung homogenates of WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice ( Fig 2b ), which was comparable, except for a statistically non-significant trend toward a slight delay in clearance of the spliced IAV M2 gene mRNA in CBFβ ΔLysM mice ( Fig 2b ) [ 26 ].   10.1371/journal.ppat.1006140.g002  Fig 2   Virus clearance and adaptive immune responses in CBFβ ΔLysM mice.  WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice were infected i.n. with a 0.1LD50 dose of A/PR/8.

For all other data, data were pooled from a minimum of 3 experiments with a total of 4–9 mice per genotype at each indicate time point. Error bars are standard error mean. A 2-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. * indicates P< .05, ** for P < .001 and *** for P < .001. L.D. is limit of detection, NS is not significant, N.D. is not detectable.     The above findings indicate that virus clearance was normal in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice, suggesting that the adaptive immune response to IAV was not affected. Indeed, following infection, BAL IAV-specific IgG antibodies ( Fig 2c ), total CD4 T cells ( Fig 2d ) and IAV-specific CD8 T cells ( Fig 2e ) in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice were comparable to WT mice. Furthermore, kinetics of effector T cell derived cytokines IFNγ, IL-10, and TNF were similar between CBFβ ΔLysM mice and their WT littermates ( Fig 2f ). Consistent with previously published observations we were unable to detect Th2 or Th17 T cell responses ( Fig 2g ) in the lungs of CBFβ ΔLysM or WT mice. A multiplex analysis of 30 cytokines and chemokines (listed in the Methods section) in the BAL fluid at days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 11 PI also gave comparable values for WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice, except for a modest elevation in CCL2 (days 7 and 11 PI) and CXCL9 (day 11 PI) in infected CBFβ ΔLysM mice. Cumulatively, these data indicate that the AlvMΦ deficiency has no demonstrable effect on the establishment of the anti-IAV adaptive immune responses and IAV clearance, or on the function and properties of the innate immune cells involved in the induction of adaptive immune responses, particularly rDCs.    IAV Infection in AlvMΦ Deficient Mice Results in Severe Respiratory Insufficiency and Marked Diffuse Alveolar Damage  The above results indicated that the quality and magnitude of the innate and adaptive host response, as well as the efficiency of virus clearance, in the IAV infected lungs were comparable between WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice. We did however observe a significant increase in erythrocyte extravasation into the airways/BAL fluid of CBFβ ΔLysM mice when analyzed at day 7 and 11 PI. In order to directly quantify the extent of vascular leak in the infected lungs, we examined the accumulation of Evans Blue dye in the airways of WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice one hour after intravenous administration. While vascular leak was comparable in WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice on day 4 PI, by day 7 PI CBFβ ΔLysM mice had markedly elevated Evans Blue dye accumulation in their airways ( Fig 3a ). These findings raised the possibility that there was substantial pulmonary capillary leak in the IAV infected CBFβ ΔLysM mice, suggesting extensive alveolar damage was occurring at the time of onset of the adaptive immune response.   10.1371/journal.ppat.1006140.g003  Fig 3   AlvMΦs regulate the susceptibility of type 1 alveolar epithelial cells to IAV infection.

Data were pooled from a minimum of 3 experiments with a total of 4–11 mice per genotype at each indicate time point. Error bars are standard error mean. For statistical analysis a two-tailed non-paired students t test, 1-way ANOVA or 2-way ANOVA was used where appropriate. * indicates P< .05, ** for P < .001 and *** for P < .001; NS is not significant.     To assess whether the elevated vascular leak in the lungs of infected CBFβ ΔLysM mice had any consequences on lung structure, we compared histopathologic changes in the lungs of infected WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice ( Fig 3b ). At day 12 PI both WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice displayed extensive interstitial inflammation and edema characteristic of severe IAV infection. However, the CBFβ ΔLysM mice additionally had extensive intra-alveolar fibrin deposition, hyaline membrane formation and loss of alveolar wall integrity, reflecting histologic features characteristics of diffuse alveolar damage ( Fig 3b ). These findings suggest that the AlvMΦ deficiency in CBFβ ΔLysM mice is linked to the development of enhanced alveolar injury following IAV infection.  A hallmark of enhanced alveolar injury with diffuse alveolar damage during severe IAV infection is compromised respiratory function, most notably diminished O 2 exchange resulting in hypoxemia. When we analyzed blood O 2 saturation in WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice following IAV infection, we observed that out to day 5 PI, O 2 saturation was comparable in both WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice ( Fig 3c ). However at day 6 PI, corresponding with the onset of the IAV specific adaptive immune response in the lungs, there was a precipitous drop in O 2 saturation in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice, which resulted in progressive severe hypoxemia on subsequent days analyzed ( Fig 3c ).  It is noteworthy that there was only a modest initial decline in blood O 2 saturation at day 4–5 PI in both WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice in spite of extensive IAV replication in the infected lungs at these early times ( Fig 2a and 2b ). The precipitous decline in O 2 saturation coinciding with the onset of adaptive immune response raised the possibility that adaptive immune-mediate clearance of IAV infected epithelial cells was responsible for the rapid decline in O 2 saturation CBFβ ΔLysM mice. Indeed, the simultaneous depletion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells at day 3 PI, thereby inhibiting the subsequent infiltration of these cells into the lungs, prevented the decline in O 2 saturation at day 7 PI in CBFβ ΔLysM mice ( Fig 3d ). By contrast, depletion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in infected WT mice had only a modest effect on O 2 saturation ( Fig 3d ). Consistent with a role for the adaptive immune T cell response to IAV in the development of respiratory compromise, infected untreated adaptive immune deficient RAG KO mice also displayed only a modest decline in blood O 2 saturation out to day 7 PI ( Fig 3d ).    AlvMΦs Regulate the Susceptibility of Type 1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells to IAV Infection  The accumulated evidence demonstrating alveolar pulmonary vascular leak, histologic changes reflecting severe alveolar damage, and compromised pulmonary function ( Fig 3a–3d ) suggested that AECs were the likely target of the effector T cells in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice. In order to determine if the T cell mediated alveolar injury in CBFβ ΔLysM mice was related to the extent of AEC infection, we infected WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice with the reporter A/PR/8–NS1-GFP strain, which allows for the identification of infected cells by GFP expression [ 27 ]. Pulmonary epithelial cells were identified as CD45 - , CD31 - and EpCAM + . Following published protocols, T1AECs were distinguished by podoplanin/T1α expression [ 28 – 31 ] and T2AECs were identified by cell surface MHCII expression, which we confirmed co-localized with intracellular pro-Surfactant Protein C staining in T2AECs from naïve lungs [ 31 – 35 ] ( S3a and S3b Fig ). CD45 - , CD31 - and EpCAM + cells that were negative for AEC lineage markers T1α or MHCII were grouped as bronchial/bronchiolar epithelial cells (referred to here as conducting airway epithelial cells) [ 35 ] ( S3a and S3b Fig ). (However, it should be noted that because of modest MHCII expression, the ratio of conducting airway cells to T2AECs might not be fully representative.) As Fig 3e demonstrates, the frequency of IAV infected T1AECs from CBFβ ΔLysM mice was significantly elevated compared to the AlvMΦ sufficient WT mice at both day 4 & 7 PI. Importantly, while the frequency of infected T1AECs from the CBFβ ΔLysM mice remained high at day 7 PI, the total number of infected T1AECs did decrease from day 4 to day 7 PI ( Fig 3e ), consistent with T cell mediated elimination of these virally infected cells at the latter time point.  In contrast, the susceptibility of the conducting airway cells and T2AECs from CBFβ ΔLysM mice to IAV infection was increased at day 4 PI, but returned to WT levels by day 7 PI, before the death of the CBFβ ΔLysM mice ( Fig 3f and S3c Fig ). Again, the total number of infected pulmonary epithelial cells decreased with the onset of the adaptive immune response in both AlvMΦ deficient CBFβ ΔLysM mice and AlvMΦ sufficient WT mice. Given the three-fold increase in infection of T1AECs in CBFβ ΔLysM mice, the two-fold increase in T2AEC infection by IAV was not unexpected ( Fig 3e and S3c Fig ). However, while both conducting and T2AEC infection rates returned to WT levels by day 7PI, the rate of T1AEC infection selectively remained high throughout infection in the AlvMΦ-deficient CBFβ ΔLysM mice ( Fig 3e and 3f and S3c Fig ).  To determine if restoring AlvMΦs to CBFβ ΔLysM mice would likewise restore resistance of T1AECs to IAV infection we employed two strategies. Firstly, we adoptively transferred 5x10 5 WT AlvMΦs into CBFβ ΔLysM mice by the i.n. route, one day prior to IAV infection. Transfer of AlvMΦs into CBFβ ΔLysM mice rescued the resistance of their T1AECs to IAV infection, but had no impact on the susceptibility of T1AECs from WT mice ( Fig 3g left panel). Importantly, this transfer of AlvMΦs into CBFβ ΔLysM mice, which conferred resistance of T1AECs to infection, also rescued CBFβ ΔLysM mice resistance to lethality after IAV infection ( Fig 3g right panels).  Secondly, we constructed mixed bone marrow chimeric mice in which irradiated WT (CD45.2 + ) mice were reconstituted with either CD45.1 + WT bone marrow, CD45.2 + CBFβ ΔLysM bone marrow, or a mixture of 90% CBFβ ΔLysM and 10% WT bone marrow (Mix). Since the CBFβ ΔLysM donor bone marrow would not be able to fully regenerate AlvMΦs in the irradiated recipients, a 10% WT bone marrow supplement was employed in the 90:10 mixed chimeras to selectively reconstitute the AlvMΦ compartment with WT cells, while all other bone marrow derived cell types would be primarily CBFβ ΔLysM bone marrow derived.  Seven weeks after reconstitution, AlvMΦs in irradiated WT bone marrow reconstituted recipients were exclusively of donor bone marrow origin ( S3d Fig ). In the 90:10 mixed bone marrow recipients, the AlvMΦs were the only myeloid cells in the lungs that were derived from WT bone marrow at a frequency greater than 10% ( Fig 3h ), reflecting a partial restoration of AlvMΦ numbers ( Fig 3i ). Following IAV infection, the T1AECs from the mixed bone marrow chimeric mice with the partial AlvMΦs rescue demonstrated an enhanced resistance to IAV infection, which was comparable to the control irradiated WT bone marrow chimeras ( Fig 3j ).  Lastly, since neutrophils, like AlvMΦs, strongly express LysM ( Table 1 ) we evaluated the impact of acute neutrophil depletion (by administration of the neutrophil depleting antibody IA8) on the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection. We observed no effect of neutrophil depletion on T1AEC susceptibility to IAV infection ( S3e Fig ). In sum these data further support the concept that CBFβ ΔLysM mice have a selective quantitative deficiency in AlvMΦs, and that this deficit in AlvMΦs results in enhanced susceptibility of T1AECs cells to IAV infection.    AlvMΦs Act Early in IAV Infection to Regulate the Susceptibility of T1AECs  Since, even in WT mice, AlvMΦ numbers are diminished by day 4 PI, ( Fig 1d ), we sought to determine when AlvMΦs conferred resistance of T1AECs to IAV infection. To do so, we employed a mouse model in which the diphtheria toxin (DTx) receptor is expressed under control of the CD11c promoter (CD11c-DTxR), allowing for the depletion of CD11c + cells, including AlvMΦs, following DTx administration. DTx was administered prior to or up to 48hours following IAV infection. The susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection was evaluated at day 4 PI, prior to the onset of the adaptive immune response in the lungs, and therefore, before the impact of DTx administration on the elimination of rDCs would manifest. Similar to T1AEC from CBFβ ΔLysM mice, T1AECs from CD11c-DTxR mice displayed enhanced susceptibility to IAV infection at day 4 PI when diphtheria toxin was administered i.n. on day -1 or day 1 PI ( Fig 4a ). On the other hand, when AlvMΦs were eliminated at day 2 PI, T1AEC susceptibility to IAV infection was comparable to T1AECs from DTx treated WT control mice ( Fig 4a ). These findings suggested that AlvMΦs function between days 1 and 2 PI to confer resistance of T1AECs to IAV infection. This is a time when there is minimal recruitment of other CD45 + cell types into the parenchyma or airways, and therefore, when AlvMΦs are the predominant CD45 + cell type in the airways.   10.1371/journal.ppat.1006140.g004  Fig 4   AlvMΦs function early in infection to confer resistance of type 1 alveolar epithelial cell to IAV infection.  a) CD11c-DTr+ and WT control littermates were given 40ng of DTx i.n. at the indicated time points pre or post infection with NS1-GFP A/PR/8.

Data were pooled from a minimum of 3 experiments with a total of 4–6 mice per genotype at each indicate time point. Flow plots are representative from 5 mice. Error bars are standard error mean. For statistical analysis 2-way ANOVA test were used. * indicates P< .05, ** for P < .001 and *** for P < .001.     To directly determine whether AlvMΦs were exposed to IAV at the time they were conferring resistance of T1AECs to infection, we evaluated the kinetics of AlvMΦ infection. As Fig 4b demonstrates, while viral genes were not detected in AlvMΦs isolated from the BAL prior to or on day 1 PI, cell surface HA and intracellular NP proteins were readily detectable by day 2 PI. This finding suggested that the regulation of T1AEC susceptibility by AlvMΦs was associated with AlvMΦ exposure to IAV.    AlvMΦs Confer Resistance to IAV Infection by Regulating Expression of a Leukotriene Pathway in T1AEC  Type I and III Interferons (IFNs) are important mediators of resistance to IAV infection and AlvMΦs have been implicated as one source of IFNs during infection [ 36 ]. Both Type I and Type III IFNs were detected at comparable levels in the BAL fluid of the AlvMΦ deficient CBFβ ΔLysM and WT mice days 0–2 PI ( Fig 5a ). This is during the time frame in which AlvMΦs were demonstrated to confer resistance of T1AEC to IAV infection. Furthermore, there was no difference in the expression of representative IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) in whole lungs or sorted T1AECs isolated from CBFβ ΔLysM and WT mice at day 2 PI ( Fig 5b and 5c ). Taken together, these findings suggested that, while IFNs are essential in controlling IAV infection, AlvMΦs were not utilizing IFNs to protect T1AEC from IAV infection.   10.1371/journal.ppat.1006140.g005  Fig 5   AlvMΦs suppress T1AEC expression of arachidonic acid metabolism pathway genes.  a-e) WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice were infected i.n. with a 0.1LD 50 of A/PR/8. a) IFNα and IFNλ protein in the BAL fluid prior to and during IAV infection.

Statistical analysis is a) 2-way ANOVA, c) a linear regression analysis or f) 1-way ANOVA. * indicates P< .05, ** for P < .001 and *** for P < .001. N.S. is not significant.     To gain insight as to why T1AECs in the presence of AlvMΦs were more resistant to IAV infection, we carried out transcriptomic profiling (RNAseq) on T1AECs isolated from the lungs of the AlvMΦ deficient CBFβ ΔLysM mice and AlvMΦ sufficient WT mice at day 2 PI, after AlvMΦ mediated resistance to infection had been conferred ( Fig 4a ).  RNAseq revealed that no genes were preferentially down regulated in the day 2 T1AECs from CBFβ ΔLysM mice, but a number of genes were preferentially upregulated. Pathway analysis on the genes over expressed in the CBFβ ΔLysM T1AECs using the NIH DAVID database revealed that nine of the genes were enzymes/co-factors involved in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway ( Fig 5d ) [ 37 , 38 ]. Four of the genes encode molecules involved in the cytochrome P450 (CYP4F18, CYP4F16), Thromboxane (Tbxas1) and 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism ( Fig 5e ). The other five genes (ALOX5, ALOX5ap, Cotl1, GGT1 and DPEP2) encode enzymes or co-factors involved in the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) pathway that generates the cysLT metabolites: leukotriene C4 (LTC4), leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and leukotriene E4 (LTE4) ( Fig 5e ). Of note, the gene encoding the sixth enzyme in this pathway, leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), also trended at greater than a two-fold enhancement in expression in the CBFβ ΔLysM T1AECs, but lacked statistical significance.  Due to the current lack of mouse models that would allow us to selectively probe T1AECs in vivo , as well as the inability to sustain T1AECs in culture ex vivo , we utilized the recently created and characterized T1AEC cell line of C57Bl/6 origin, LET1 cells, to explore any link between AlvMΦ mediated resistance of T1AECs to IAV and the expression of these arachidonic acid pathway enzymes in T1AECs [ 28 ]. We first confirmed publish results that podoplanin positive LET1 cells can be infected with A/PR/8 NS1-GFP IAV as determined by GFP expression ( Fig 5f ) [ 28 ]. Consistent with our in vivo findings, primary AlvMΦs co-cultured directly with LET1 cells (or separated by a membrane barrier in transwell cultures) significantly reduced the infection of LET1 cells by IAV ( Fig 5f ). Co-culture of LET1 cells with splenic CD11c + cells resulted in only a minimal increase in resistance of LET1 cells to infection, suggesting that the effect of the AlvMΦs on the LET1 cells was not due to a simple change in the MOI of the T1AECs in culture. We next utilized the LET1 and AlvMΦ co-culture system to determine if AlvMΦ mediated resistance to IAV was linked to the transcriptional inhibition of these arachidonic acid pathway enzymes in T1AECs. As Fig 5g demonstrates, consistent with our findings in vivo , the expression of genes encoding the arachidonic acid metabolism enzymes were reduced in infected LET1 cells co-cultured with AlvMΦs.  To determine if the activity of one or more of these arachidonic acid metabolism enzymes facilitates IAV infection of T1AECs, we examined the impact of small molecule inhibitors targeting these enzymes on the susceptibility of LET1 cells to IAV infection. Inhibition of thromboxane synthase enzymatic activity in LET1 cells with the inhibitor Ozagrel had minimal or no impact on IAV infection of the LET1 cells ( Fig 6a ). On the other hand, inhibition of enzymes along the cytochrome P450 F and A family pathway (by the small molecule inhibitor HET0016) resulted in a modest, statistically significant impact on IAV infection of LET1 cells ( Fig 6a ). Furthermore, inhibition of the activity of the 5-LOX pathway enzyme ALOX5 by Zileuton also produced a similar significant reduction in LET1 cell susceptibility to IAV infection ( Fig 6a ). We next examined the impact of inhibition of the activity the two enzymes downstream of ALOX5 in the cysLT pathway that were likewise upregulated in T1AECs from the AlvMΦ deficient mice. Inhibition of the activity of gamma glutamyl transferase-1 (GGT1) (which converts the metabolite LTC4 to LTD4) in LET1 cells alone with the drug Acivicin markedly reduced the susceptibility of LET1 cells to IAV infection. Conversely, inhibition of the enzyme DPEP2 (which converts LTD4 to the less biologically active metabolite LTE4) with the inhibitor Cilastatin had no effect on T1AEC susceptibility to infection ( Fig 6a ), suggesting that LTD4, but not LTE4, may regulated the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection.   10.1371/journal.ppat.1006140.g006  Fig 6   Inhibition of the 5-LOX pathway or blockade CysLT1 renders T1AECs resistant to IAV infection.  a) Infectivity of LET1 cells infected with NS1-GFP A/PR/8 in the presence of the specified treatment. b) Lentivirus shRNA knockdown of GGT1 (left panel) and the impact LET1 cell infectivity (right). c) WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice were infected i.n. with NS1-GFP A/PR/8 and treated i.n. with 2.5mg/kg of Acivicin or vehicle at 5 and 29hours post infection.

Statistical analysis is a either a 2-way ANOVA, 1-way ANOVA, or a two-tailed non-paired students t test. * indicates P< .05, ** for P < .001 and *** for P < .001.     AlvMΦs, which render T1AECs resistant to IAV infection in vivo and in vitro , also reduced GGT1 expression in vivo and in vitro ( Fig 5b and 5c ). Inhibition of GGT1 enzymatic activity in T1AECs by Acivicin, likewise, decreased T1AEC susceptibility to IAV infection. Because Acivicin is not a selective GGT1 inhibitor, we next determined if knockdown of GGT1 expression in LET1 cells would also reduce their susceptibility to infection. As Fig 6b shows, compared to cells expressing control-scrambled shRNA, partial knockdown of GGT1 expression by GGT1 shRNA lentivirus treatment ( Fig 6b left panel) also reduced the susceptibility of shRNA treated LET1 cells to IAV infection ( Fig 6b right panel).  Although the interaction of AlvMΦs with LET1 cells in vitro recapitulated the effect of AlvMΦs on the susceptibility of T1AECs in vivo , this in vitro interaction likely does not reflect the full impact of AlvMΦs on T1AECs during IAV infection in vivo . Therefore, in order to determine if LTD4 production impacted the susceptibility of T1AECs in vivo , we evaluated the effect of Acivicin administration to WT and CBFβ ΔLysM mice on the susceptibility of T1AEC. Acivicin was administration at 5 and 29 hours PI i.n. to inhibit early LTD4 production. These time points are prior to the large influx of CD45 + inflammatory immune cells into the lung, which can also be a significant source of cysLT metabolites [ 26 ]. In vivo Acivicin treatment markedly reduced the susceptibility of T1AEC from CBFβ ΔLysM mice to IAV infection. Of note, Acivicin had only a minimal effect on the susceptibility of T1AECs from the AlvMΦ sufficient WT mice ( Fig 6c ). This latter finding suggests that the ability of Acivicin to reduce the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection is not due to nonspecific suppression of IAV infection.  The above evidence supported a link between the activity of the 5-LOX/cysLT metabolic pathway in T1AEC and their susceptibility to IAV infection. This is of interest as elevated levels of LTE4, the stable terminal metabolite of the cysLT pathway, has been reported to correlate with increased severity of IAV infection in both humans and mice [ 39 ]. LTD4 signals by engaging the cell surface Cysteinyl LT receptors (CysLT1 and/or CysLT2). The aforementioned RNAseq analysis revealed that at day 2 PI T1AECs express CysLT1 with twenty-two-fold higher FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase Mapped) than CysLT2 ( Fig 6d ). This is of particular interest as CysLT1 has higher affinity for LTD4 than CysLT2.  In order to explore the possibility that LTD4 engagement of CysLT1 on T1AECs was responsible for the enhanced susceptibility of T1AECs in the AlvMΦ deficient CBFβ ΔLysM mice, we administered the CysLT1 antagonist Zafirlukast to these mice. As Fig 6e demonstrates, like Acivicin, i.p. administration of Zafirlukast on days 0–3 PI, markedly reduced T1AEC susceptibility to IAV infection in CBFβ ΔLysM mice. Consistent with this data, Zafirlukast administration also rendered the treated CBFβ ΔLysM mice resistant to lethal IAV infection ( Fig 6f ). These data are consistent with the concept that AlvMΦs act, at least in part, to suppress the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection by inhibiting cysLT pathway, possibly in T1AECs, which in-turn suppresses LTD4 signaling through CysLT1 on T1AEC.  The above findings suggest that engagement of CysLT1 on T1AECs enhances the susceptibility of these cells to infection by IAV. It has previously been reported that the initial enzyme in the Arachidonic Acid Metabolic Pathway, Phospholipase D, may facilitate IAV uptake [ 40 ]. Furthermore, key signaling molecules activated downstream of LTD4’s engagement of CysLT1 (ROCK1 and RAC) have been demonstrated to facilitate endocytic uptake of IAV [ 41 , 42 ]. Therefore, we next sought to determine if AlvMΦs, which inhibit the arachidonic acid metabolism and cysLT pathway, also modulate endocytosis in T1AEC by evaluating receptor-dependent endocytic uptake of transferrin. As Fig 6g demonstrates, IAV-infected AlvMΦs, but not naïve AlvMΦs, decreased LET1 cell receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis of transferrin that was labeled with the pH-sensitive dye pHrodo Red. Similarly, inhibition of GGT1 activity with Acivicin also decreased LET1 cell endocytic uptake of pHrodo Red labeled transferrin ( Fig 6g ). These findings are consistent with our data demonstrating AlvMΦ-mediated suppression of the cysLT pathway and protection of T1AECs from IAV infection in vitro and in vivo .     Discussion  In this report we have evaluated the contribution of AlvMΦs to the host response in experimental IAV infection. We observed that mice with a genetic deficiency selectively in AlvMΦs (CBFβ ΔLysM mice) are highly susceptible to IAV infection. This deficiency in AlvMΦs resulted in increased susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection that could be rescued by transferring WT AlvMΦs into the CBFβ ΔLysM mice, suggesting that AlvMΦs are important mediators of T1AEC resistance to IAV infection. Along with increased numbers of infected T1AEC, the IAV infected AlvMΦ deficient mice also exhibit severely compromised pulmonary function and morphologic evidence of diffuse alveolar damage, which are compatible with severe lethal IAV pneumonia. While Type I and Type III IFNs are essential for respiratory epithelial cell resistance to IAV infection (including T1AEC), AlvMΦ-mediated protection of T1AECs was IFN-independent. Rather, our data strongly implicates that AlvMΦ-mediated transcriptional suppression of the cysLT pathway enzymes in T1AECs is one possible mechanism that mediates T1AEC resistance to IAV infection. Consistent with this resistance mechanism, inhibition of the cysLT pathway enzymes, in particular GGT1 reduced the susceptibility of T1AECs in CBFβ ΔLysM mice to infection, as did antagonism of the cysLT receptor CysLT1.  Earlier reports evaluating the host response to IAV infection demonstrated a critical role for AlvMΦs in modulating the severity and outcome of IAV infection [ 9 – 13 , 19 ]. While AlvMΦ phagocytosis of IAV particles, cellular debris and clearance of edema fluid undoubtedly contributes to AlvMΦ-mediated protection during IAV infection, a direct link between AlvMΦ function and the development of lethal pneumonia was not established in these reports. While it is currently not possible to directly assay cysLT metabolite production exclusively by T1AEC in vivo or ex vivo , to probe T1AEC CysLT receptor activity in vivo or ex vivo , or to disrupt this arachidonic acid metabolic pathway specifically in T1AECs in vivo , our results strongly suggest that there is a link between AlvMΦ-mediated resistance of T1AECs to IAV infection and AlvMΦ-mediated suppression of the expression of genes evolved in the cysLT pathway in T1AECs. This was evident both in vivo , where T1AEC from infected AlvMΦ deficient mice exhibited elevated expression of genes encoding cysLT pathway enzymes, as well as in vitro , where co-culture of T1AEC with AlvMΦs during IAV infection reduced both the expression of cysLT pathway genes and IAV infection. Additional support for a role of the cysLT pathway enzymes in regulating the efficiency of T1AEC IAV infection came from the effect of inhibiting 5-LOX (by the inhibitor Zileuton) and GGT1 (by the inhibitor Acivicin) specifically in LET1 cells. Even more compelling was the finding that treatment of infected CBFβ ΔLysM mice and WT mice with Acivicin within the first two-days post infection significantly reduced the frequency of infected T1AEC in the AlvMΦ deficient CBFβ ΔLysM mice, but had minimal effect on infection of T1AEC from infected WT mice. While our findings most likely reflect the impact of a quantitative deficiency in the number of AlvMΦs in the lungs of the CBFβ ΔLysM mice, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that there is a subtle change in the function of the few residual AlvMΦs detected in the lungs. Likewise, we also cannot formally exclude that alterations in the function of other LysM expressing cell types lacking CBFβ could also affect the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection, and therefore the outcome of infection in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice. However, findings on the effect of AlvMΦ transfer into CBFβ ΔLysM mice, as well as the effect of acute depletion of AlvMΦ in the CD11c-DTR model, strongly implicate AlvMΦs as having a primary role and mediating resistance of T1AECs to infection.  The timing of AlvMΦ-mediated protection, along with the timing of cysLT gene activation and the brief, early timeframe in which Acivicin treatment worked have two important implications. First is that in vivo T1AECs are protected at a time point when AlvMΦs would be the predominant, if not exclusive, cell type in the alveoli to detect the infection and confer resistance to T1AEC. Therefore, it is formally possible that AlvMΦs are not the only CD45 + cell type capable of providing protection to T1AECs, and that it is their proximity to the AECs at this early time point that allows them to confer protection. Second, many of the CD45 + cell types that have been classically established as the cysLT producers have yet to substantially accumulate in the lungs or reach the airways by day 2 PI, which, once again, is when our data, particularly on Acivicin administration, strongly suggests that the cysLT metabolites are acting on the T1AECs to enhance their susceptibility to IAV infection. The finding that T1AECs may produce cysLTs is further supported by a growing body of literature demonstrating that, while initially in vitro data indicated that only myeloid cells express 5-LOX and therefore produce cysLTs [ 43 ], in vivo non-hematopoietic cell types as diverse as neurons, epithelial cells and endothelial cells are capable of expressing 5-LOX and producing cysLTs [ 44 – 50 ].  Methylation of the ALOX5 gene promoter has been reported in cell lines where the cysLT pathway is inactive. Therefore, methylation of ALOX5 has been suggested as the mechanism of gene silencing that accounts for the lack of 5-LOX expression and cysLT production by these cell types [ 48 – 50 ]. Since AlvMΦs prevent the upregulation of the cysLT pathway genes in T1AECs, AlvMΦs may confer resistance of T1AECs to infection by maintaining the ALOX5 promoter in a methylated state. As far as we are aware, there is minimal information concerning mechanisms to account for suppression, particularly transcriptional suppression of the cysLT pathway beyond methylation of the ALOX5 gene. We therefore attempted to identify the suppressive factor by screen the BAL fluid for inflammatory mediators that maybe differentially represented in the CBFβ ΔLysM mice at day 2 PI when the 5-LOX and the cysLT pathway is suppressed by AlvMΦs. However, as noted above ( Results ), a 30-plex-cytokine/chemokine survey revealed no detectable differences in the inflammatory mediators present in the BAL at days 0 and 2 PI.  Activation of the cysLT pathway results in the synthesis of the cysLT metabolites LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4. A role for LTD4 engagement of CysLT1 on T1AECs was supported by the evidence that blockade of CysLT1 through Zafirlukast administration markedly reduced T1AEC susceptibility to IAV infection and prevented IAV associated mortality in CBFβ ΔLysM mice. These findings raise the possibility that T1AEC production of the CysLT metabolite LTD4 may support cellular uptake or replication of IAV in T1AEC by signaling through cysLT receptors displayed by T1AEC.  Engagement of CysLT1, a G-protein coupled receptor, by LTD4 results in the mobilization of intracellular calcium. IAV has been reported to utilize calcium dependent activation of the ROCK-1 and RAC-1 signaling pathways in cells to facilitate IAV virion uptake and internalization [ 41 , 42 ]. Constant with this work, we found that IAV-infected AlvMΦs were able to suppress LET1 cell endocytic uptake of transferrin. Signaling through CysLT receptors can also result in calcium-dependent activation of PI-3 kinase and CAM kinase in cells, which in turn enhances IAV gene expression in cells infected with certain IAV strains [ 41 ]. Thus the enhanced susceptibility of T1AEC to IAV infection in the absence of AlvMΦs may reflect both increased efficiency of virus uptake and the extent of virus replication as a result of CysLT1 engagement.  While we observed an increase in the frequency and absolute number of infected T1AEC in CBFβ ΔLysM mice, overall lung virus titers in these animals only trended towards a slight enhancement and were only modestly elevated compared to lung virus titers in WT mice. This was in contrast to earlier reports in other mouse models [ 12 ] where an AlvMΦ deficiency resulted in elevated pulmonary virus titers. This discrepancy is perhaps not unexpected as the deficiency in AlvMΦs numbers is quantitative in our model, and T1AECs, while capable of productive IAV infection, are not as efficient in virion production as conducting airway epithelial cells [ 28 ]. Therefore, the 3-fold increase in infected T1AECs in the AlvMΦ deficient mice may not significantly impact the level of detectable virions in the infected lungs. We also demonstrate that the enhanced mortality of CBFβ ΔLysM mice after IAV infection is likely not a direct result of virus mediated destruction of the increased number of IAV infected cells. Rather, our results suggest that the increased number of infected T1AEC rendered these cells more susceptible to adaptive-mediated elimination, and as a consequence, the development of lethal diffuse alveolar damage.  In conclusion, we have identified a novel role for AlvMΦs in modulating the severity of IAV infection by regulating the expression of the cysLT pathway in T1AECs and, as a consequence, the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection. In addition to the mechanism proposed in this manuscript, AlvMΦs are likely to act though other IFN-dependent and—independent mechanism to limit IAV severity. However, our findings raise the possibility that therapeutic strategies to limit the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection, including blockade or antagonism of CysLT receptor signaling, early in infection could limit the development and severity of lower respiratory tract IAV infection.    Materials and Methods   Ethics Statement  This study was carried out in strict accordance with the Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 91–579) and the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (OLAW/NIH, 2002). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Virginia Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC; Protocol Number 2230) [ 26 ].    Mice and Infection  All mice were breed and housed in a pathogen-free environment and used at 7–14 weeks of age for all experiments. NS1-GFP virus was a generous gift from the Adolfo Garcia-Sastre laboratory. Influenza A viruses PR8 (H1N1) and NS1-GFP [ 27 ] were grown in the allantoic cavity of day 10 chicken embryos as described previously [ 26 ]. Mice were infected with 250 EID 50 units of PR8 (0.1LD 50 ), or 10 5 EID 50 NS1-GFP [ 26 ]. All infectious doses were administered i.n. in 50μL of serum-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) following ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. For i.n. transfer of cells, 500,000 AlvMΦs were given in 50uL of serum-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) following ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. Irradiation and bone marrow transplantation mice were irradiated with 9.5 Gy and, within 24hours, i.v. injected with RBC-lysed bone marrow cells (1–3 × 10 6 ) [ 26 ]. For AlvMΦ depletion CD11c-DTr+ and CD11c-DTr- BALB/C littermates were given 40ng of DTx i.n. following ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. Acivicin was diluted in serum-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) and 2.5mg/kg was given i.n. in 50uL following ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. 10mg/kg of Zafirlukast was given daily on days 0–3 PI by i.p. injection in 1mL of saline with 1%DMSO and 2% hydroxypropyl-β- cyclodextrin (HPCD).    Sample Preparation  Mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation. Lungs were then perfused with PBS via the heart. Lungs were enzymatically digested with Type II collagenase (37°C for 30 minutes; Worthington) for analysis of hematopoietic cells. For epithelial cell analysis lungs were inflated and digested with Dispase 2 (37°C for 30 minutes; Invitrogen). Digestion was followed by passage through a steel mesh screen to remove tissue fragments. Red blood cells in the cell suspensions were lysed using ammonium chloride. Cells were enumerated using a hemocytometer. Cells were re-suspended in FACS buffer containing PBS, 2% FBS, 10mM EDTA, and 0.01% sodium azide for Ab staining or MACS buffer containing PBS, 2% FBS, and 10 mM EDTA.    Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (Cytokine, Viral Titer and Anti-Influenza IgG)  We obtained BAL fluid by flushing the airways three times with a single inoculum of 500uL sterile PBS introduced via a trachea incision. BAL fluid cytokine content was determined using the Luminex 100 IS system maintained by the UVA Flow Cytometry Core. The 30-factors assayed were: Eotaxin, GM-CSF, IFNg, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL12p40, IL-12-70, LIF, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IP-10, KC, MCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, M-CSF, MIP-2, MIG, RANTES, TNF. Viral titer was determined via endpoint dilution assay and expressed as tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) units as previously described [ 26 ]. We incubated MDCK cells (ATCC collection) with tenfold dilutions of BAL fluid in serum-free trypsin supplemented DMEM culture medium. After 3–4 day incubation at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 , culture supernatants were collected and mixed with a half- volume of 1% chicken red blood cells (University of Virginia Veterinary Facilities) to detect virus replication by hemagglutination. Detectable hemagglutination indicated virus replication was used as the calculate sample TCID50 values [ 26 ]. Influenza specific IgG antibodies in the airspaces were quantified by coating ELISA plates with A/PR/8 and incubating with tenfold dilutions of BAL fluid from influenza virus-infected mice. After washing, anti-mouse IgG was used to detect the amount of influenza specific IgG antibodies that where present in to BAL fluid at day 11 PI.    Flow Cytometry Staining, Analysis, and Sorting  All FACS antibodies are purchased from BD Biosciences or eBioscience. The dilution of surface staining antibodies was 1 in 200 for 30 min at 4°C. After antibody staining, we examined cells using a six or eight-color FACS-Canto system (BD Biosciences) and the data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Treestar) and FMO or isotype controls were used to set gates. We characterized the epithelial cell types as follows: Conducting airways (CD45 - CD31 - T1α - EpCAM + MHCII - ) and T1AECs (CD45 - CD31 - T1α + EpCAM + ). AlvMΦs were isolated from whole lungs by MACS enrichment for cells expressing either CD11c or Siglec F according to manufactures protocol generating around a 90% pure AlvMΦ population. T1AEC sorting was done using a modified protocol for sorting cells from culture for RNAseq analysis [ 51 ]. Briefly, T1AECs were stained and sorted directly into Trizol LS from whole lung suspensions in the presence of RiboLock using the Becton Dickinson Influx Cell Sorter and DEPC treated 1XPBS.    Quantitative Reverse-Transcription PCR  We isolated RNA from the lungs via Triazol (Invitrogen) and treated it with DNase I (Invitrogen). We used random primers (Invitrogen) and Superscript II (Invitrogen) to synthesize first-strand complementary DNAs from equivalent amounts of RNA from each sample. We performed real-time RT-PCR in a 7000 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Data were generated by the comparative threshold cycle (ΔCT) method by normalizing to HPRT [ 26 ]. Forward and reverse primers amplifying are as follows, respectively:  M2 :5′GAGGTCGAAACG CCT 3′ & 5′CTGTTCCTTTCGATATTCTTCCC3′, CYP4F18: 5′ AGAGCCTGGTGCGAACCTT 3′ & 5’ TGGAATATGCGGATGACTGG 3’, CYP4F16: 5’GGAGTGGCTTCCTGGATTTT3’& 5’ATGCAGGGTCAACAATCCTC3’, TBXAS1: 5’AGGCTTCTGAAAGAGGTGGACCT3′ & 5′TGAAATCACCATGTCCAGATAC3′, ALOX5: 5′ATGCCCTCCTACACTGTCAC3′ & 5′CCACTCCATCCATCTATACT3′, ALOX5ap: 5’CTCCCAGATAGCCGACAAAG3’ & 5’CAGAACTGCGTAGATGCGTA3’, COTL1: 5’GATGAGGGCAAACTTGGATCT3’ & 5’GAGCAGATTACCAGCACTTCA3’, GGGT1: 5’AGGAGAGACGGTGACT3' & 5' GGCATAGGCAAACCGA3', DPEP2: 5’CTGACCTTTCTCTGCCACA3’ &5’GAATCTTCCTGATGACCTCCTG3’    Evans Blue Dye  At the indicated day after infection with influenza, approx. 20mg/kg of Evans Blue dye in 500uL of 1X PBS was administered via the i.v. route. One hour later bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained as described above. The absorbance of the dye at 620nm and 740nm was measured in BAL following removal of cells and debris and quantified with a standard curve obtained at the same time.    Histology  Lungs were inflated with air using a sterile syringe and an intra-tracheal incision. The inflated lung was tied of and placed into Bouin’s Fix Solution for at least three days. Fixed lungs were taken to UVA’s Research Histology Core for Paraffin-embedding, slicing and Hematoxylin and Eosin staining.    Measurement of Pulmonary Function  The MouseOx Pulse-oximeter (Starr Life Sciences, Oakmont PA) was used to measure blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ). Prior to infection thigh hair of all mice was removed. Following ketamine and xylazine anesthesia, the thigh clamp was placed on the mouse and reading where taken on each mouse until it recovered from anesthesia. Oxygen saturation measurements were taken during recovery from anesthesia when oxygen saturation measurements had plateaued and only reading deemed successful by the software were used in our analysis.    LET1 Cell Culture, Infection and Treatment  Let1 cells (a gift from Paul Thomas, St. Jude Hospital) were cultured and infected as previously described [ 28 ]. Briefly, 50,000 LET1 cells/ well were allowed adhere to wells of a 24 well tissue culture plate for 18hours in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. Cell monolayers were then washed with OptiMEM to remove serum and non-adherent cells and then infected with A/PR/8 NS1-GFP in OptiMEM at an M.O.I. of ~100 to insure maximum infection of cells. Infection was carried out for 24hours, after which cells were liberated from the wells by manual manipulation. Two wells were pooled for each sample and live cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for T1α and GFP expression. For co-culture of Let1 cells with AlvMΦs, 100,000 AlvMΦs were added directly onto the LET1 cells or into transwell inserts at the time of LET1 plating and the same infection protocol mentioned above was followed. All drugs were introduced into the LET1 cell cultures at the time of infection at the specified concentrations, with or without DMSO, in OptiMEM. For stable knockdown of GGT1 in LET1 cells, lentiviral particles with control scrambled or GGT1 targeted shRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-35474-v) and used according to the manufactures protocol. Briefly, after an overnight incubation in 12 well plates, media containing Polybrene and 5 or 10uL of lentiviral particles was added. Cells were incubated overnight at 37°C and stable infection was selected for by maintaining the cells in media containing Puromycin dihydrochloride at 5ug/mL. For transferrin experiments, AlvMΦs were exposed to virus for 15 minutes at 4°and 20min at 37°. After virus was washed off the AlvMΦs were added to inserts and co-cultured with serum starved LET1 cells for one hour. pHrodo Red labeled transferrin (molecular probes) was then added to LET1 cells as per the manufacture’s protocol for 10 minutes at 16° followed by a 30 minute incubation at 37°. Fluorescence intensity was determined by flow cytometry.    RNAseq  Cells were sorted as described above, stored at -80°C and shipped to BGI Americas in trizol. There, RNA was isolated, enriched by poly-A-selection, and amplified. Following this samples were barcoded and sequenced using a 101PE lane on a HiSeq 2000 sequencer by Illumina.  Data were processed with the Tuxedo Suite software package [ 52 ]. Paired-reads were aligned and mapped to the GRCm38 mouse genome assembly, followed by differential expression analysis. Gene expression pathway analysis was carried out using the DAVID bioinformatics database [ 37 , 38 ]. GEO accession number GSE93085.    Statistical Analyses  Data are means ± SEM. We used non-paired Student's t test, one-way ANOVA or two- way ANOVA for statistical analyses. We considered all P values >0.05 not to be significant.

The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication.      Phylogenetic inference is an attractive means to reconstruct transmission histories and epidemics. However, there is not a perfect correspondence between transmission history and virus phylogeny. Both node height and topological differences may occur, depending on the interaction between within-host evolutionary dynamics and between-host transmission patterns. To investigate these interactions, we added a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations and examined if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. Our ABC framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic. Finally, we applied our ABC inference on two different outbreaks from the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic.    Author Summary  Over the past few years, epidemiological models for infectious diseases have incorporated network structure: each individual has a set of contacts to whom they can pass the infection. However, collecting data to develop a good representation of the network is very challenging. The increasing availability of sequence data provide additional information: previous work has shown that it is possible to recover social network features from viral phylogenies. Until now, however, it was assumed that within-host evolution is negligible in the reconstruction. Here, we propose an approach based on approximate Bayesian computation to infer network structure from a virus phylogeny, explicitly including a model for within-host evolution. In addition, we incorporate other important heterogeneity factors such as individual-based transmission rates and infectivity varying by disease-stage. We show that in some situations the within-host virus diversity adds valuable signal to identify network structure, but in other situations it muddles the underlying contact structure.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002  National Institutes of Health    RO1AI087520   Thomas Leitner        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359  Vetenskapsrådet    340-2013-5003   Tom Britton     This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (grant number 340-2013-5003) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (grant number R01AI087520).

The structure of these networks is a major determinant of the pathogen transmission dynamics and possible control strategies [ 1 ]. For example, it has been suggested that human sexual contact networks are characterized by a power-law-like degree distribution [ 2 – 4 ] which, in a specific range of the scaling exponent, results in an infinite variance of the network’s degree distribution. This implies the absence of an epidemic threshold, making prophylactic strategies for sexually transmitted diseases very challenging.  The main issue with contact network-based epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual- and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population’s contact structure. This has led to an interest in methods to infer information about host contact networks from epidemiological data. Previously, Britton and O’Neill [ 5 ] estimated the parameters of an Erdős-Rényi network and a stochastic epidemic process on it using recovery times of infected hosts, and Groendyke et al. extended the approach to exponential-family random graph models [ 6 ] using covariate information [ 7 ].  The use of other common epidemiological measures such as the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ), epidemic peak size, duration and final size, has been shown to be effective in classifying the degree of heterogeneity in a population’s unobserved contact structure [ 8 ].  During the course of an epidemic, the pathogen spreads over a subset of edges in the social network forming a subgraph that is the realized transmission history. Keeping track of who transmits to whom and assuming that every individual may be infected only once and by only one other individual, such a transmission history can be represented as a rooted tree ( transmission tree ) [ 9 ]. However, full transmission histories are rarely observed and commonly available epidemiological data such as diagnosis-recovery times of infected people may provide information on who was infected, when, and for how long, but it provides limited information on who acquired infection from whom [ 10 ].  Since pathogens evolve over a transmission history, the analysis of pathogen genetic sequences taken from different hosts provides a way to infer the most likely donor and recipient [ 11 ] introducing constraints on the space of possible transmission trees, which are a trace of the underlying contact network. Phylodynamics [ 12 ] focuses on linking methods of phylogenetic analysis with epidemiological models under the assumption that if the evolution of a pathogen occurs sufficiently fast, transmission histories become “recorded” in the between-host pathogen phylogeny ( phylogenetic tree ).  Phylodynamic analyses of HIV-1 have shown that asymmetry in viral phylogenies may be indicative of heterogeneity in transmissions [ 13 ]; networks with more heterogeneous degree distributions yield transmission trees with smaller mean cluster sizes, shorter mean branch lengths, and somewhat higher tree imbalance than networks with relatively homogeneous degree distributions. However, it has been argued that these direct effects are relatively modest for dynamic networks [ 14 ] or if only a small fraction of infected individuals are sampled [ 15 ]. Also, factors other than contact rate, such as high infectiousness during acute infection, may have a more dramatic impact on asymmetry [ 15 ].  However, previous studies as well as more recent papers [ 16 – 18 ], assume that the unobserved transmission tree is identical to the reconstructed time-scaled phylogeny ( virus genealogy ), i.e. the internal nodes of the genealogy correspond to transmission events between hosts over time and within-host diversity is fundamentally ignorable. This is unrealistic since all coalescent events in a pathogen phylogeny occur within hosts, pushing the genealogy node heights further back in time than the nodes of the transmission tree, known as the pre-transmission interval [ 19 ]. In addition, the order of coalescent events may not correspond to the order of transmission events but rather reflect within-host dynamics [ 20 – 22 ].  The objective of this study was to include within-host evolution, disease stage, and individual specific transmission rates to improve the realism of social network reconstruction. We simulated epidemic spread on three prototypic network types and investigated the behavior of several tree statistics, including both topological imbalance measures and tree-based distance measures. In addition, we investigated the effect of varying epidemic size, varying sampling proportion, as well as heterochronous sampling on the tree statistics. Finally, we analyzed data from two different epidemiological scenarios of spread among injecting drug users (IDU) in the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for network model choice and parameter inference following the algorithm defined in [ 23 ]. We found that virus geneaologies can differ from the underlying transmission tree in both topology and branch length and, therefore, that meaningful inference of social networks needs to take within-host evolution into account.    Materials and Methods   Simulation of transmission history   Networks  We considered three prototypic network models to represent population contact structure: the Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graph [ 24 ], the Barabási-Albert (BA) graph [ 25 ] and the Watts-Strogatz (WS) graph [ 26 ] with low rewiring probability ( Fig 1 ). These three networks are characterized by different degree distributions and amount of clustering. The degree of a node in a network is the number of connections to other nodes it has and the degree distribution is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network.   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.g001  Fig 1   Prototypic network structures.  A. Erdős-Rényi network (ER), B. Barabási-Albert network (BA), C. Watts-Strogatz network (WS). To illustrate the typical configurations, all networks have the same size (50 nodes) and they are characterized by the same mean degree (6). The rewiring probability is 0.01 in WS.     The ER model generates networks with Poisson degree distributions (in the limit), i.e. p  (  k  )  =  e  -  θ  θ  -  k  k  ! . The BA model is generated by using a linear preferential attachment algorithm that produces scale-free networks with a power-law degree distribution p ( k ) ∝ k − α with α = 3. The WS model has a Dirac degree distribution centered at K (all nodes have the same degree) when the rewiring probability tends to 0. If the rewiring probability tends to 1, the degree distribution is Poisson. For intermediate values, the shape of the degree distribution has a pronounced peak at k = K and decays exponentially for large | k − K |. A WS network is characterized by a relatively homogeneous structure, as all nodes have more or less the same degree, and by a high degree of local clustering as opposed to ER and BA networks. The networks were simulated using the igraph package in R [ 27 ].    Epidemic model  We simulated outbreaks from a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) type dynamic [ 28 ] of HIV-1 spread in the susceptible population on each type of contact network. We compared differences among the transmission trees obtained by simulating epidemic spread under four increasingly more realistic transmission ( S1 Fig ) and evolutionary model specifications ( S2 Fig ):  The first model specification assumed that the rate of transmission per contact between a susceptible and an infected individual, λ , is constant over time. The removal rate of infected individuals γ is also constant over time and includes both diagnosis and death. We denoted with p the probability of being sampled at the moment of diagnosis (DNA sequences obtained from the virus of the diagnosed patient). We assumed that (i) diagnosis coincides with treatment start, (ii) the rate of transmission after treatment start is negligible, and (iii) nobody goes off treatment. We believe these assumptions to be reasonable for our analysis since Sweden has already achieved the 90-90-90 target set by UNAIDS in 2014 [ 29 ] according to which (i) 90% of all people leaving with HIV will know their HIV status, (ii) 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and (iii) 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression [ 30 ].  In the second model specification we considered three stages of HIV infection (acute, chronic, and pre-AIDS). Here, the transmission rates are dependent on the disease stage of the infected individual and denoted λ 1 , λ 2 , and λ 3 ( S1 Fig ). We assumed the removal rate to be independent on the disease stage. The acute stage was assumed to last 30 days for each individual [ 31 ], the chronic stage had variable length described by an exponential random variable T 2 with a mean of 8 years [ 32 ], and the pre-AIDS stage lasted until death or diagnosis. The three transmission rates were calculated to preserve the individual total infectivity during their infectious period in order to make results comparable with the first model specification. This derivation is shown in S1 Text .  In the third model specification we modeled individual variability of transmission rates. We did that by multiplying the constant transmission rate λ (as in the first model specification) with a log-normal variable Z i for each i individual (node) with location parameter − σ 2 /2 and scale σ in order to preserve the mean of λ (i.e. E( λ i ) = λ since E( Z i ) = 1).  Finally, the fourth model specification combines stage-specific infectivity with individual heterogeneity. The sampling process is modeled explicitly in each model specification.  We used Gillespie’s next-reaction method [ 33 , 34 ] to simulate disease spread according to the above outlined model specifications until there are no more infectives or until a predefined number of samples. Keeping track of who-infects-whom, each epidemic simulation yields a transmission history.     Within-host evolution model  The phylogeny of pathogens such as HIV-1 collected from infected persons in an epidemic reveal a considerable amount of information about the underlying transmission history since mutations are typically accumulated faster than transmission occurs. The common assumption that the internal nodes of a phylogeny correspond to transmission events between hosts over time is, however, unrealistic because transmitted lineages must already exist in the donor at the time of transmission. Thus, neglecting the time difference between the common ancestor and the transmission event (i.e. the pre-transmission interval, [ 19 ]) will bias the estimated time of transmission backwards in time.  Furthermore, new infections may come from HIV-1 variants derived from a latent reservoir (lineages can persist for long time in the host [ 35 , 36 ]), and the order of coalescent events may not correspond to the order of transmission events but reflect instead within-host dynamics [ 21 ].  To address these issues, we used a two-phase coalescent model described by a linear growth from a single transmitted variant (transmission bottleneck) to a maximum population size followed by either stabilization or decline of the effective population size [ 21 ].  Let N ( t ) denote the viral population size at time t since infection (expressed in days), such that N  (  t  )  =  α  1  +  β  1  t  ,  t  ≤  t  x  α  1  +  β  1  t  x  +  β  2  (  t  -  t  x  )  ,  t  >  t  x where α 1 is the population size (i.e. the number of virus variants in a given host) at the moment of infection, β 1 is the rate of population size increase until t x (time at maximum diversity), and β 2 the rate of decline after the maximum. We assume α 1 = 1, β 1 = 3, t x uniformly distributed between t a = 2 and t b = 8 (years) and β 2 ∼ U ( ϕ , 0) where ϕ = ( N min − α 1 − β 1 t a )/( t M − t a ) with N min being the minimum population size, (assumed to be 100) and t M the maximum sampling time (20 years) ( S2 Fig ).  Virus genealogies conditional on a transmission history are simulated by generating random coalescence times for each person in the tree. Random coalescence times are generated from the inverse cumulative density function (derivation in [ 21 ]) F − 1 ( u ) = 1 − ( 1 − u ) b ( k 2 ) ( a + b t ) b − 1 where u is a uniform random variate on (0, 1), t is the current time along the forward time axis, b is the linear rate of change ( β 1 or β 2 depending on the phase), a is the starting population size (1 in the first phase and β 1 t x in the second phase) and k is the number of extant sampled lineages in a given host. For each host we draw random values of t x and β 2 from the prior distributions. Starting at the last transmission or sampling event, we first move to the next event along the reverse time axis, which is either a transmission event, a rate change, or the time at which the current host was infected. If the event is a transmission event, then k is incremented and a random coalescence time is generated. If that time occurs before (along the reverse time axis) the next event, then two random extant lineages in the sample are selected to coalesce; or if not, then time is moved to the time of the next event. At t x , when the rate changes, the parameters of the inverse cumulative density function are changed to correspond to the first model-phase and the process continues until the transmission time of the current host is reached. In the rare instance where more than one sampled lineage exists at the time of infection, the existing lineages are randomly coalesced with zero length branches. Finally, each individual sub-tree is joined into a single viral genealogy according to the transmission history.  The 4 model specifications introduced in the previous section were used for simulations until the “end” of each outbreak, i.e. when there are no infectives left. We compared outbreaks of similar final size and multiple realizations of virus genealogies for each transmission history. All simulations were implemented using the statistical software R [ 37 ].    Tree statistics  Transmission trees and virus genealogies are complex objects. Therefore, in order to evaluate and compare them we used a number of summary statistics ( Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.t001  Table 1   Summary statistics computed on time scaled trees (transmission trees and virus genealogies).            Tree statistics  Definition      Sackin’s Index [ 38 ]  The average number of splits or ancestors from a tip to the root of the tree.    Colless Index [ 39 ]  At each internal node, partition the tips that descend into groups of sizes r (to the right) and l (to the left), and compute the sum of absolute values | r − l | for all nodes.    Cherries  The number of clades with two taxa.    External/internal branch length ratio  The ratio between the mean external branch length (branch that ends with a sampling event) and the mean internal branch length (branches between coalescence events).    Tree height  The time from the first infection/coalescence (after the index case) to the last sampling event.    Topological distance  Twice the number of internal branches defining different bipartitions of the tips.    Number of lineages through time [ 40 ]  The number of lineages across the tree. If all infected individuals are sampled, it corresponds to the prevalence curve.    Branch length growth rate over time  The average branch length obtained at several time points, divided by the tree height evaluated at the same.       These tree statistics include topology measures, branch length summaries, and lineages through time progression. The Sackin’s index can be normalized according to a reference model (we used the Yule model) in order to obtain a statistic that does not depend on the tree size. Both Sackin’s index and Colless index depend only on the topology of the tree, and they are invariant under isomorphisms and relabeling of leaves. They reach their maximum value at caterpillars (ladder-like trees), and their minimum on the maximally balanced trees. A binary tree is considered to be perfectly balanced if each internal node in the tree divides the leaves descending from it into two equally sized groups. The expected number of cherries in a tree with n taxa under a Yule model is n /3. In an asymmetric tree (more ladder-like trees), tips tend to coalesce with branches deeper in the tree, and there are fewer cherries than expected. The number of cherries and Sackin’s index complement each other well, as the number of cherries captures asymmetry in the recent evolutionary past, while Sackin’s index captures asymmetry over the entire evolutionary history of the sample. These two measures are only weakly correlated [ 15 ]. A high ratio of internal branch to external branch length occurs in ‘star-like’ trees. The tree height in a virus genealogy represents the time from the first infection to the last sampling event. Since epidemics progress at different speed on different networks, heterogeneities in tree heights are expected.  The topological distance, obtained as twice the number of internal branches defining different bipartitions of the tips. A topological distance that takes branch lengths into account was also considered (the sum of the branch lengths that need be erased to have two similar trees.) The number of lineages through time was normalized in time and by the maximum number of lineages [ 40 ]. We used the package R package ape (Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution) [ 41 ] to create and plot the phylogenies and the package apTreeshape [ 42 ] for the evaluation of some tree statistics.    Approximate Bayesian Computation for network model selection  To further investigate how well time-scaled phylogenies can estimate the epidemic process and identify the underlying contact network, we applied an inference framework for model selection and parameter estimation based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). ABC is a methodology to estimate model parameters replacing the likelihood function with a simulation-based procedure and a distance function to measure the similarity between simulated and observed data. Various ABC algorithms have been proposed, from the simple ABC-rejection [ 43 ] to ABC Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [ 44 ] and ABC based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods [ 23 , 45 ].  Here, we use ABC-SMC as proposed by Toni et al. [ 23 ] because it addresses some of the potential drawbacks of previous ABC algorithms, such as slow convergence rate, by sampling from a sequence of intermediate distributions. The SMC sampler introduces a number of intermediate steps decreasing iteratively the tolerance threshold ϵ for samples acceptance. At the first iteration, N particles θ ′ (representing the parameters of interest) are generated from the prior distribution and data are simulated from the model based on θ ′. The proposed parameters are accepted if the difference between the summary statistics of the simulated data D ′ and the observed data D is below the threshold ϵ 1 . At iteration t > 1, the particles are drawn from the previous population of the accepted samples at the iteration t − 1 (with threshold ϵ t −1 ) with slight perturbations. In our work, data (observed virus genealogy) and simulated trees are compared through the use of summary statistics which correspond to the above listed tree statistics ( Table 1 ).  The three network models M = { WS , ER , BA } were used to simulate outbreaks using the stage-varying infectivity profile with ratio 10:1 acute:chronic and patient infectivity variation ( σ = 3). We assumed that network model and one network parameter were unknown. For ER, the network parameter of interest was the probability of drawing an edge between two arbitrary vertices; for BA it was the number of edges to add in each time step of the generating algorithm, and for WS it was the neighborhood within which the vertices of the lattice are connected. We also estimated the removal rate γ and the infection rate in the acute phase λ 1 (infection rates in the chronic and immuno-compromised stage can be obtained deterministically from the acute phase infection rate). Therefore, θ consists of 3 parameters for each type of network and they are model specific. All remaining parameters characterizing both the network structure and the epidemic process were considered known.  The output of the algorithm were the approximations of the model M marginal posterior distributions P ( M | D ) which is the proportion of times that each model is selected in N samples, and the marginal posterior distributions of parameters P ( θ | D , M ) for the candidate models. We used a discrete uniform distribution from 1 to 3 as model prior π ( M ).  We chose to decrease the tolerance values following an exponential decay such that ϵ t = ϵ 0 exp(−0.5 t ) where t is the current sequential step, as proposed in [ 46 ]. A pilot run of 100 simulations for each model in M was used to define the initial thresholds. Convergence was assumed when the acceptance rate of newly proposed particles had dropped below 1 in 100, and visual inspection of the posterior distribution showed no change in the last iterations We found that convergence was achieved with T = 10 iterations and N = 1000 particles per iteration. The prior distributions on the parameters λ 1 and γ were Uniform (0.0001, 0.1) and (0.00025, 0.1), respectively. The computation time of the algorithm depended on the tree size and sampling fraction and it took between 1 and 2 hours in a parallel implementation on 8 processors. Further details of the algorithm and its computational cost can be found in S2 Text .    Real epidemiological data and genealogical reconstruction  We applied the ABC inference method to the analysis of two HIV-1 DNA sequence sets sampled from different IDU transmission epidemics in Sweden [ 47 , 48 ]. To reconstruct the time-scaled virus phylogenies from the DNA sequences we used a Bayesian Skyline coalescent model in BEAST 1.8 [ 49 ]. The general time reversible nucleotide substitution model was used with an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock and a discretized gamma distribution with four categories was used to model rate heterogeneity across the sequence. For the log-normal relaxed clock parameters, a uniform prior on the positive axis was assumed for the mean, and an exponential with mean 1/3 for the standard deviation. A Uniform prior on (0, 1) was used for the nucleotide frequencies. The MCMC was run for 10 million iterations, with a 10% burn-in period and samples saved every 10000 iterations. We selected the maximum credibility tree and the negative branches were set equal to zero.     Results  To compare our simulation results, we used networks with the same mean degree (8) and a constant rewiring probability ( ρ = 0.01) for the WS networks. The SIR-type models were characterized by a transmission rate of 0.01 per contact, a removal rate γ = 2.8 year −1 and sampling probability p = 1, unless specified otherwise.   Within-host evolution affects inference of contact networks  The within-host model generates virus genealogies that are consistent with a given transmission history, but not necessarily identical to it. An example of the impact of the within-host evolutionary process in a small size network/epidemic is shown in Fig 2 . This figure shows a transmission history (A), its transmission tree representation (B), and four compatible virus genealogies (C-F). The genealogies display branch elongation/compression as compared to the transmission tree but also changes in topology. For instance, lineage 5, sampled in individual 5 infected by 2 soon after 2’s own infection, appears consistently on the top part of the simulated virus genealogies and its branch can only be elongated by a small amount (because the pretransmission interval is small). On the other hand, lineage 10, infected later by 2, is located in different parts of the possible genealogies, thus indicating changes in the virus genealogy topology versus the underlying transmission tree. This happens because longer time implies an increase in the virus diversity in 2, i.e. more lineages are available in the donor. Therefore, as many virus trees are possible under any transmission history, it is important to evaluate the additional variation within-host diversity inflicts on the epidemiological inference. An epidemic can spread faster on ER and BA networks, thus the resulting transmission tree from a WS network includes longer times resulting in taller trees ( Fig 3A ). This is mainly because WS has higher clustering than ER or BA. Both the unobservable transmission tree and the observable virus genealogy show the same tree height information. Other tree statistics, however, show different patterns of network discrimination based on transmission tree or virus genealogy. The proportion of cherries per taxa is slightly less informative on virus genealogies than on transmission trees ( Fig 3A ). In particular, while there is a decrease for ER and WS (less balanced in virus genealogies than transmission trees), it increases for BA (more balanced in virus genealogies than transmission trees). A similar pattern is seen using Sackin’s Index or Colless’ Index (ER and WS less balanced in virus genealogy, BA more balanced ( Fig 3D and 3E )). Overall, differences between BA and WS become more evident in virus genealogies. Because Sackin’s Index and Colless’ Index are highly correlated we will only report Sackin’s Index from now on.   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.g002  Fig 2   Relationship among transmission history, transmission tree and virus genealogy.  For a given transmission history between hosts (A), we can construct a binary representation, i.e. the transmission history (B). The lower panels (C) show 4 possible virus genealogies of this transmission history invoking our within-host population model.      10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.g003  Fig 3   Box plots of tree statistics on transmission trees ( red ) and reconstructed virus genealogies ( light blue ).  Tree height (A), number of cherries per taxa (B), mean internal/external branch lengths ratio (C), Colless Index (D), Sackin’s Index (E), mean branch length (F). The boxes correspond to the first and third quartiles. The upper/lower whisker extends from the third/first quartile to the highest/lowest value which is within 1.5 IQR from the box, where IQR is the inter-quartile range.     An epidemic spreading on an ER network is similar to a population random mixing model. Therefore, it is expected to generate a balanced transmission tree [ 13 , 15 ]. The average number of people infected by an individual in the ER network show little variance and therefore the within host evolution model will add some heterogeneity producing small changes in the tree topology leading to an increase in the unbalancedness in the resulting virus genealogy. In BA models, instead, the presence of superspreaders generate transmission histories that are very unbalanced [ 13 ]. When a donor infects two or more recipients within a short interval, the order of transmissions along with infection times become impossible to accurately reconstruct; all splits are within the donor, describing within-host evolution in the donor (also shown in [ 21 ]). Overall, the pretransmission interval associated with each and every transmission is a random draw from the possible coalescence times in the donor’s viral population. Therefore, in BA networks the virus genealogy will show larger changes in the tree topology with respect to the underlying transmission trees and result in more balanced trees. The ratio of the mean internal to external branch lengths is informative about the type of network (smallest for BA, higher for ER, highest for WS). While the trends were similar in transmission trees and virus genealogies, the expected ranges overlapped for ER and WS in transmission trees, and virus genealogies showed generally smaller ratios ( Fig 3C ). Branch lengths increase linearly as a function of tree height during epidemic spread on both ER and BA networks. Deviations from linearity are observed for epidemic spread on WS ( S3 Fig ). At the end of an epidemic, the mean branch length is constant among networks but longer in virus genealogies rather than in transmission trees ( Fig 3F ). Overall, trees from ER and WS networks are more imbalanced based on virus genealogies. However, as an epidemic spreads much faster in a BA network, the resulting virus genealogy will instead become more balanced because the virus does not have time to evolve time-structure between transmission events.    Contact network heterogeneity becomes less evident under stage varying infectivity  Infectivity is known to vary across HIV-1 pathogenesis [ 50 , 51 ]. Thus, rather than assuming a constant transmission rate throughout an infected person’s disease stages, we tested 7 different infectivity profiles varying the ratio between the acute and chronic transmission rates and measured how they affected network model discrimination. The transmission rate in the pre-AIDS stage was held constant. Tree height becomes much less informative of network type the bigger the difference is between acute and chronic stage infectivity ( Fig 4A ). This is because higher acute stage infectivity causes more infections in the acute phase and consequently the epidemic spread is faster. Since infection happens so rapidly, the external branches become very long compared to the internal branches, as all internal nodes are pushed to the root the higher the ratio between acute and chronic stage infectivity. Therefore, the total tree height is dominated by the external branch lengths (which are on average 1/ γ ). Similarly, mean internal over external branch lengths, which was an important index when constant infectivity was assumed, is less informative if we assume high acute/chronic stage infectivity ratios. Differences observed between ER and BA assuming a constant infectivity profile diminish ( Fig 4D ). Hence, branch length and tree height measures are less informative of network type when differences in acute-chronic infectivity are considered. Topological tree measures, i.e., cherries per taxa, and Sackin’s Index, were less affected by differences in acute-chronic infectivities ( Fig 4B and 4C ). Both these measures, calculated on the possible virus genealogies, still informed about the underlying contact network structure that HIV spread upon.   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.g004  Fig 4   Box plots of tree statistics on virus genealogies under varying infectivity profiles.  Tree height (A), number of cherries per taxa (B), Sackin’s index (C), mean internal/external branch lengths ratio (D). Box plots limits are as in Fig 3 .       Variability in individual infectivity may affect network discrimination  The next stage of introducing realistic host evolutionary dynamics is to model patient specific differences. We did that by introducing variability in the overall infectivity level while keeping the acute-chronic ratio at 10:1 ( σ = 0, 3, 10). While it was clear that introducing a non-constant infectivity profile diminished genealogical differences between underlying contact network structures, it was less obvious what effect introducing between-patient variation had ( Fig 5 ). While tree height remained with no power to discriminate between networks, internal to external branch length ratios became more discriminative (BA had lowest ratio, ER intermediary, and WS high). Individual variability seems to affect tree symmetry near the root more than towards the tips, since the Sackin’s Index shows much more variation than the number of cherries per taxa. However, they both improved their power to discriminate between contact network structures, and Sackin’s Index could differentiate WS from BA and ER networks. Thus, these simulations showed that the complex interactions that affect the resulting tree statistics when multiple levels of variability interact (within-host coalescence process, timing of infections relative to disease- and epidemic-stage, disease-stage infectivity differences, and patient individual variation), may induce non-trivial dynamic patterns.   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.g005  Fig 5   Box plots of tree statistics on virus genealogies for different assumptions on individual heterogeneity.  Tree height (A), number of cherries per taxa (B), Sackin’s index (C), mean internal/external branch lengths ratio (D). Box plots limits are as in Fig 3 .       Tree statistics change as epidemics develop  If no influx of susceptibles occurs, the mean branch length increases as trees grow taller because it takes longer time to find uninfected hosts later in an epidemic ( Fig 6A and 6B , see also S4A Fig ). At 100% sampling of infecteds at any time during an epidemic, the mean branch length increases as a function of total number of sampled infecteds (number of taxa, Fig 6B ). BA typically produces shorter tree branches than ER and WS as more individuals are sampled. Thus, if it were possible to sample everyone at time of infection, then the trend of adding longer tips towards the end of the epidemic becomes more pronounced ( Fig 6A ). The internal to external branch length ratios typically decrease as the epidemic progresses ( S4B Fig ). This is mainly explained by the depletion of susceptible neighbors for individuals infected late in an epidemic, thus generating very long external branches. In addition, branches added later in the epidemic, resulting from chronic donors, divide already existing branches into shorter segments. BA trees show lower ratios than ER and WS throughout the epidemic, but WS and ER are less distinguishable during an epidemic. On the topological level, the Sackin’s Index typically decreases as an epidemic matures ( Fig 6C ). At the end of an epidemic ( Fig 3 ), BA and ER show more unbalanced trees throughout an epidemic and the most imbalanced trees come from WS networks ( Fig 6C and 6D ). Simulations on networks of size 5000 show similar results: for comparison, see Fig 6 with S5 Fig and S4 Fig with S6 Fig . Thus, while these statistics are indicative of the underlying contact network, they are confounded by epidemic stage and the size of the susceptible population. Consequently, to be able to infer the underlying contact network from genealogies we must also know what stage an epidemic has reached and the number of susceptibles.   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.g006  Fig 6   Distance based and topological tree statistics on virus genealogies as epidemic progresses on a network of size 1000.  Mean branch length (MBL) as function of the number of infected individuals (A) and as function of the number of taxa (sampled infected individuals) (B) for simulated outbreaks on networks of size 1000 as epidemics progress. Note that there is a time interval between infections and diagnoses (which correspond to removal/sampling times).

The curves are obtained using local regression (LOESS). WS ( red ), ER ( green ), BA ( blue ).       Sample fraction affects tree statistics  While a genealogical tree grows as an epidemic matures, the sampling fraction has no real effect on mean branch length, albeit with smaller sample fractions the estimation becomes somewhat more uncertain due to stochastic effects ( S7 Fig ). Interestingly, lower sampling fraction increases mean branch lengths derived from any underlying contact network ( S7 Fig ). This happens because the remaining branches in the genealogy represent increased numbers of infected hosts. However, this effect does not cause additional confusion over that caused by epidemic stage, as the differences between BA, ER, and WS networks are distinct at all epidemic stages and number of infected. On the other hand, we do not usually know at what stage an epidemic is (i.e., number of actually infected) but only the number of sampled hosts. The mean branch length as a function of number of taxa ( Fig 7 ) could mislead the inference of underlying contact network, especially for small sample fractions. In fact, any branch length or tree height index would be affected by mistaking number of sampled hosts with stage of the epidemic because the number of infected grows faster than the number of sampled early in an epidemic.   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.g007  Fig 7   Mean branch length as function of the number of taxa varying sampling fraction.  Mean branch length as function of sampled hosts, with varying sampling fraction (p = 1-0.25). The envelopes represent 95% confidence intervals around the medians. The curves are obtained using local regression (LOESS). Note that for smaller sampling fractions the envelopes include fewer taxa. WS ( red ), ER ( green ), BA ( blue ).     The topological indices were also affected by sampling fraction. While general trends ( Fig 3 ) remain constant through the cumulative number of samples over an epidemic, it is again important to know at what stage an epidemic is at time of sampling. Similar to branch length indices, topological indices can be misleading if sampling faction and stage of the epidemic are unknown.    ABC inference of transmission network type  We illustrate the performance of the ABC inference on 100 simulated viral genealogies for each network type of size 1000. The parameters were chosen so that the mean degree of each network type was 8, the diagnosis rate was 2.8 years −1 (derived from the average time from seroconversion to diagnosis in Sweden estimated in [ 52 ]), and infection rate in the acute phase was λ 1 = 0.005. The sampling probability p was set at 0.5 because the data from the general HIV Swedish epidemic have coverage of around 50% [ 52 – 54 ].  To investigate model selection performance of the ABC algorithm, we record the number of times that the true model has the highest posterior model probability P ( M | D ) among the three models for the 100 simulated datasets. The algorithm was able to discriminate among the network models quite well. For the first network model (ER), in 78 out of the 100 simulated datasets, the true model had the highest posterior probability among the 3 different network types. For the second model (BA), similar results were obtained; 76 out of the 100 simulated datasets identified BA. Outbreaks on the WS network were misclassified only 1 time out of 100. The corresponding network parameters were estimated reasonably well in most cases ( Table 2 ). For illustration, we report the results of a randomly chosen experiment where the observed data were obtained from an epidemic spread on an ER network ( Table 2 ). The parameters to estimate are the mean degree, diagnosis and infection rate for an outbreak on an ER network. The estimation of the removal (i.e. diagnosis) rate was sometimes skewed towards the upper bound, which probably is due to branch elongation induced by the within-host evolution model.   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.t002  Table 2   Parameter estimation for one epidemic spread on an ER network.

In principle, it would be possible to add the rewiring probability, ρ , of the WS network in the ABC inference and estimate it. However, the rewiring probability of the WS networks turns out to be quite difficult to identify in the model choice setting. This is because for large values of ρ a WS network becomes indistinguishable from a ER network S1 Table . At ρ < 0.1 there was typically still a good chance ( P ( M = m | D ) = 0.70 − 0.95) to identify the correct network structure m .    Application to data from real epidemics  Inference of epidemic parameters as well as network type becomes more complex in real outbreaks. We consider two genealogies from separate IDU-associated HIV-1 CRF01 and subtype B epidemics in Sweden, respectively. The CRF01 tree was sampled from a rapid outbreak that was imported from Finland [ 48 ] around 2003, which was quiescent until the outbreak started in 2006. The subtype B tree was sampled from the more slowly, and typical, spreading IDU epidemic in Sweden [ 47 ].  While tree indices were different between the trees from the Swedish HIV-epidemic ( Fig 8 ), and superficially in line with what one might expect comparing an outbreak scenario to a more endemic situation, e.g., mean branch lengths were 279 and 913, and tree height 4176 and 10527, respectively, they cannot be directly compared because these trees represent different stages in the respective epidemic. Furthermore, real data is rarely sampled at 100% of all infected or even diagnosed, so comparisons to our simulated overall network differences are difficult to evaluate. Thus, to evaluate genealogies from real epidemics we must consider epidemic stage and sampling fraction (Figs 6 and 7 ).   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.g008  Fig 8   Time-scaled HIV-1 phylogenies from the Swedish epidemic among IDU.  A. The genealogy from a rapid CRF01 outbreak, and B the genealogy from a slower spreading subtype B epidemics. Trees were inferred by a Bayesian skyline coalescent model using BEAST 1.8 [ 49 ].     In the ABC analysis of the two IDU HIV-1 transmission chains among IDU we have assumed the same epidemiological model as in the simulations (stage-varying infectivity profile with ratio 10:1 acute:chronic, patient infectivity variation ( σ = 3)) and a sampling fraction of 50%. For the CRF01 IDU outbreak, the susceptible population was assumed to be 200 and in the Swedish subtype B ongoing epidemic it was set to 3000. Results are shown in Table 3 .   10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005316.t003  Table 3   Network type posterior probability for the two Swedish outbreaks.               WS  ER  BA      CRF01  0.16  0.39  0.45    subtype B  0.34  0.57  0.09       Overall, convergence was more difficult to achieve in the analysis of the real data and the tolerance levels ϵ had to be set to higher values than in the simulation studies. However, the posterior model probabilities seem to indicate that the two outbreaks display different associations to the three network models considered even though there is no single model (among the three network models considered) that can be used to appropriately describe each outbreak.  For the CRF01 outbreak, there is weak evidence (45%) in favor of the BA network type although the ER was also supported with a posterior probability of 39%, with small differences in the parameter estimates. The infection rate in the acute phase was λ 1 = 0.018(0.009, 0.031) vs λ 1 = 0.023(0.0015, 0.036), γ = 0.001(0.0006, 0.002) vs γ = 0.001(0.0005, 0.002) and the mean degree was 3.2(2.4, 3.6) vs 3.7(2.2, 4.1) in the BA and ER respectively. The HIV-1 subtype B outbreak was mostly (57%) associated with an ER network type. However, there was considerable uncertainty in the parameter estimates: λ 1 = 0.0025(0.001, 0.004), γ = 0.0003(0.0003, 0.001) and the mean degree 1.4(1.3, 2.1).     Discussion  In this study we addressed several outstanding factors that could affect HIV phylogenetic tree shape in addition to the underlying contact network upon which HIV spreads. While previous studies have evaluated how contact networks affect the resulting tree [ 13 , 14 , 16 ], they ignored differences between transmission trees and virus phylogenies, varying infectivity over disease progression, among patient infectivity variation, sampling fraction, and epidemic stage. Here, we show that all these factors put further restrictions on what type of phylogeny one can expect, but also that these additional factors may confound the inference of contact network.  Transmission histories are not perfectly reconstructed by virus phylogenies. In fact, it has been previously shown that virus phylogenies have a time bias that elongates external branches, shifts internal nodes backwards, and may cause lineage disordering relative to the transmission history [ 19 ]. In this study we account for these factors by sampling (many) possible virus genealogies from a transmission history using a recently developed within-host coalescent model [ 21 ]. Because many virus genealogies may be consistent with one single transmission history, one would expect this factor to add uncertainty to the network inference. However, there is also added signal about transmission times because the within-host diversity changes over the time of infection. Thus, because the degree distributions are different for each network type ( Fig 1 ), transmissions happen after different lengths of infection time, which affects the phylogenetic tree shape. Indeed, we show that the contact network inference from virus genealogies can be quite different than that from transmission trees, and that tree balance differences in fact may be more informative using virus phylogenies. Besides, transmission histories or trees can never be observed, or only partially and then with great uncertainty, which is the main reason for turning to phylogenetic reconstruction in the first place.  It is well known that infectivity is not constant over disease progression, albeit the literature is uncertain about how big the difference is between acute and chronic stage infectivity [ 51 , 55 ]. Indeed, we find that varying infectivity affects the expected phylogeny under different contact networks. In fact, this factor alone seems to diminish phylogenetic differences between contact networks. Somewhat surprisingly, patient variation in infectivity works in the opposite direction, i.e., it seemed to amplify differences in the contact network structures. The result is that virus genealogies do carry a signal of what type of contact network HIV spread upon, but the expectations are different than what one would expect from a naïve model where no virus diversity exists and all hosts are described by an identical constant infectivity over their pathogenesis.  We do not investigate systematically if there is one factor that explains the expected genealogies simulated under the different network assumptions. Rather, the complex dynamic interaction of the heterogeneity factors included implies that a single cause for the differences observed may not exist. However, we compare only epidemic spread on three network types with the same mean degree and we used tree statistics to assess the differences. In certain settings, ER and BA behaved similarly (and differently from WS). In this case, it is likely that the difference is due to clustering, since there is no large difference between the degree distributions in the ER and WS, whilst WS is the only network (among the three considered) allowing clustering. In some other scenarios, WS and ER behaved more similarly (and differently from BA). This is most likely due to the different degree distributions.  We show that any tree index that one would measure is affected by sampling fraction and the stage of the epidemic. We show that phylogenies cannot be meaningfully interpreted without this additional knowledge, as tree statistics otherwise may mislead the inference of contact network. While our results relate to epidemic situations relevant to HIV epidemics, they may also be relevant to other measurably evolving pathogens such as hepatitis C and influenza.  The developed ABC inference framework for network identification and parameter estimation showed discriminatory power and ability to recover epidemiological parameters when applied to simulated data. The model used for validating the ABC algorithm included stage varying infectivity, individual, and within-host variability. For complex models such as epidemic spreads on networks the likelihood function is computationally costly to evaluate and ABC offered a way to perform likelihood-free statistical inference. Furthermore, the use of summary statistics allowed us to study the relationship between readily measurable tree statistics and complex transmission dynamics. The analysis of the two outbreaks from the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic showed that inference on real datasets is typically much harder. As is to be expected, real world networks do not match perfectly with the simplified models considered in this study, that were chosen for comparability with previous studies [ 13 , 14 , 16 ]. In fact, in the ABC algorithm, the proposed parameters values are accepted if the simulated data based on them are close enough to the observed data. If the observed data were generated from a rather different or more complex model, then the simulated data from the candidate model probably will be far away from the observed data. Hence, very few proposed parameter values will be accepted. More realistic models, such as dynamic networks, may be able to better capture the features of the outbreaks, especially those occurring over a long period of time. Another class of network models that could be suitable in modelling these outbreaks is the configuration model which are flexible and have been studied extensively in the literature, or exponential random graph models (although in general slower to fit to data) which include a broader spectrum of degree distributions and clustering levels rather than the three simple networks considered here. The ABC inference scheme can also be extended to take into account uncertainty in the phylogenetic reconstruction, as shown in [ 56 ]. Each summary statistics calculated on the simulated trees would then be compared to the distribution of the same statistics calculated on the posterior distribution of virus genealogies. Romero et al. [ 56 ] apply this procedure investigating transmission between a heterosexual couple. However, the outbreaks we are analyzing in this paper are bigger in size and the whole algorithm would be more computationally expensive. Lastly, this work could be further extended to integrate other sources of network data coming from social surveys and/or public health intervention studies, as recently outlined in a review paper by [ 57 ] to improve network analysis in HIV epidemiology.

The use of fragment libraries is a popular approach among protein structure prediction methods and has proven to substantially improve the quality of predicted structures. However, some vital aspects of a fragment library that influence the accuracy of modeling a native structure remain to be determined. This study investigates some of these features. Particularly, we analyze the effect of using secondary structure prediction guiding fragments selection, different fragments sizes and the effect of structural clustering of fragments within libraries. To have a clearer view of how these factors affect protein structure prediction, we isolated the process of model building by fragment assembly from some common limitations associated with prediction methods, e.g., imprecise energy functions and optimization algorithms, by employing an exact structure-based objective function under a greedy algorithm. Our results indicate that shorter fragments reproduce the native structure more accurately than the longer. Libraries composed of multiple fragment lengths generate even better structures, where longer fragments show to be more useful at the beginning of the simulations. The use of many different fragment sizes shows little improvement when compared to predictions carried out with libraries that comprise only three different fragment sizes. Models obtained from libraries built using only sequence similarity are, on average, better than those built with a secondary structure prediction bias. However, we found that the use of secondary structure prediction allows greater reduction of the search space, which is invaluable for prediction methods. The results of this study can be critical guidelines for the use of fragment libraries in protein structure prediction.

This is primarily due to the difficulties and costs associated with experimental techniques, such as NMR and X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, genomes are sequenced at relatively low cost, increasing the gap between known sequences and known structures motivating the development of computational tools for protein structure prediction (PSP). Among such tools, comparative modeling yields the best results when the target sequence has a high degree of sequence similarity with proteins available in structural databases. When such homologous structures are not available, an ab initio approach is required.  Ab initio methods consist in predicting the native structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence alone. It is a formidable computational challenge usually associated with hundreds of degrees of freedom and complex energy functions in an attempt to model the intricate interplay of forces stabilizing the protein structure. The computational cost for sampling and evaluating a very complex energy landscape to identify the global minimum is too high even for small proteins.  The description of the secondary structures [ 2 , 3 ] and regular turns [ 4 , 5 ] helped to reduce the complexity of the PSP problem. Later, the pioneering work of Jones and Thirup [ 6 ] lead to the discovery that a single portion of a protein could be modeled using fragments from other proteins, regardless of any apparent evolutionary correlations. The fragments structures varied from secondary structures and simple coils to parts of two secondary structures joined by a loop [ 7 – 9 ].  Currently, many successful PSP methods such as ITASSER [ 10 – 12 ], ROSETTA [ 13 ] and QUARK [ 14 ] use fragment libraries to boost the accuracy and reduce the number of degrees of freedom during the conformational search. The combination of ab initio prediction and fragment libraries is only possible because fragments are not restricted to closely related proteins [ 15 ]. Han and Baker [ 16 ] suggested that a single structure can be associated with more than one sequence, and found a pattern which correlates sequences of fragments to local motifs. The authors showed that motifs were coded by sequences of amino acids sharing common properties such as charge, the presence of aromatic residues and, mainly, hydrophobicity.  Although fragments are stable throughout different proteins and protein families, as they are part of a protein rather than an isolated molecule, they are subject to different forces when the chemical environment is changed. Therefore, the same sequence may code for different structures. This multiplicity of structural states for a single sequence and the fact that the same structure can be found in various non-homologous proteins [ 17 , 18 ] are the key to PSP methods using fragments. Since a fragment represents a likely local minimum of the potential energy function, its use allows the protein to jump from one conformation to another, thus exploring the energy landscape more effectively than a gradient-based optimization or a molecular dynamics simulation [ 13 ].  Fragment libraries are also considered valuable tools for loop predictions. Loop structure prediction is regarded as a difficult task since loops are subject to more structural diversity, as they are the main components of protein surfaces and are frequent in binding sites. Some authors report promising results in loop prediction using smaller fragments because, although not optimally representing an entire loop, they helped reduce the number of conformations to be evaluated [ 19 , 20 ].  Levitt [ 21 ], Kolodny and collaborators [ 22 ] successfully rebuilt a protein from a collection of small fragments. Holmes and Tsai [ 23 ] evaluated the ability of different fragment libraries to model the native structure concerning cost and accuracy of building models in Cartesian space versus torsion space, and the effects of the first and last angles of the inserted fragment on the overall structure. The authors also showed a significant increase in model quality when fragment bond angles and bond distances were added to the models, as opposed to solely using dihedrals. There is also evidence that no fragment size is ideal, and it has been suggested that one needs libraries with different fragment sizes.  Xu and Zhang [ 24 ] investigated several criteria for optimal fragment libraries, such as predictions of residue–residue contacts derived from distance profiles, torsion angle prediction, optimal number of fragments per position, secondary structure prediction and sequence similarity. Among these, the most relevant were proven to be secondary structure prediction and sequence similarity. The author concluded the fragment of 10 residues lead to the best results and that the library should have least 100 fragments per position.  In search of the optimal fragment length, Handl and collaborators report that larger fragments are surprisingly useful, and it has been proposed that fragments of smaller sizes should be derived from them [ 25 ]. The work also supports the importance of smaller fragments in refining the structure, in particular, β -sheets, and recommends further investigation on which attributes result in a better fragment library. From a set of 1261 non-redundant proteins, Baeten and collaborators [ 19 ] derived the Brix database composed of 4-14 residues long fragments. Brix contains 1000-2000 conformations for each fragment length. Using only the backbone Root Means Square Deviation (RMSD) as a scoring function and without any fragment selection criterion, i.e., using the whole fragment database, close to native structures were built. They showed that loop regions could be better reconstructed using smaller fragments, although regular secondary structures were best approximated by larger fragments. Later, it was reported that the variability of loops connecting helices is greater than those connecting β -strands [ 26 ].  To further integrate structural constraints, it has been proposed that better fragment selection could be achieved if protein class information were taken into account [ 27 ]. The authors integrated class annotations predicted from sequence alone to fragment libraries and used the Rosetta ab initio protocol to model native structures, reporting up to 7% improvement in model quality.  To sample as many feasible conformations as possible, a library must contain as many structurally diverse fragments as possible, avoid redundancies and, if possible, include fragments that, at least locally, strongly correlate with the target sequence. Usually, the score from a substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM) is used to select which fragments will be contained in a library, and several PSP methods use secondary structure predictors as an additional criterion to select fragments. One of the most commonly used secondary structure predictor is PSIPRED [ 8 ], which has been especially successful since CASP4 when it reached an 80.6% success rate for 40 protein domains [ 28 ]. However, to our knowledge, it has never been fully evaluated how or to which extent secondary structure prediction increases the predictive potential of fragment libraries.  Fragment libraries have been shown to work well in practice by greatly improving the quality of the predicted structures, but considering how current PSP methods rely on fragment libraries, it is important to obtain guidelines for their use and construction. Despite being commonly used, some essential aspects of fragment libraries that influence the correct modeling of native structures remain to be determined. This study investigates some crucial features of a fragment library in the reconstruction of the native structure, isolated from the limitations of ab initio methods, such as an imprecise energy function and optimization algorithms. Concretely, we addressed the extent to which the following features affect the assembly of tertiary structures: (1) secondary structure prediction guiding fragments selection, (2) different fragments sizes and (3) the structural clustering of fragments within libraries. All the simulations were performed with fragments excised from structures that are non-homologous to the targets, therefore emulating a free-modeling prediction.    Results and Discussion  For each protein in the test set, 30 models were built from libraries comprising fragments of 3 to 20 residues long, selected by their sequence similarity with the target protein (given by the score of BLOSUM62) combined with their secondary structure prediction (given by PSIPRED confidence). These libraries were built using the Profrager server [ 29 ] ( https://www.lncc.br/sinapad/Profrager ).  We adopted the RMSD of the main chain atoms (N, C α , C) against the structure deposited in the PDB as the measure to evaluate the accuracy of the models. For small proteins, a model is often regarded as good if the RMSD is below 3 Å, acceptable when below 5 Å and uninformative when above 5 Å [ 30 ].   Single-size fragment libraries  The distribution of RMSDs of the models created by each individual library shows smaller fragments have the potential to generate more accurate results ( Fig 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g001  Fig 1   RMSDs of the best models of single-length, PSI libraries.  The blue line marks the RMSD cutoff for an acceptable model. Libraries on the left of the green line generated at least 50% models below the RMSD cut-off. Outliers not shown.     Our data shows that none of the models done with 12-mers or larger, and few of the models done with 10-mers to 12-mers meet the RMSD criterion for acceptable models. Even though longer fragments may bring more empirical information into the model, thus further constraining the search space and speeding the convergence towards the native state, the models built purely from longer fragments were of lesser quality than those built from smaller fragments.  There are two possible reasons for the inferior quality of the models assembled with longer fragments. The first is that they might be insufficiently well-represented in databases since the structural diversity grows with the number of residues [ 19 ]. Fragments in regions of α -helices have more quality when compared to those of regions of β -sheets, which probably makes longer fragments unsuitable to correctly model β -sheets [ 31 ]. Ergo, longer fragments are of lesser quality because known proteins lack a suitable structure for the target sequence.  The second reason is that the insertion of a longer fragment when the conformation is close to native may bring changes that, though locally favorable, could be too drastic for the rest of the structure. Taken together, the lack of diversity and the stronger perturbation may account for the less accurate models obtained using longer fragments.  Fragments with 9 residues or smaller generated satisfactory models for at least half of the proteins studied ( Fig 1 ). Fragments larger than 9 have been supported elsewhere, but the tests always involved a combination of large fragments of many different sizes, as well as smaller fragments ([ 14 , 19 , 24 ]). Our data reveals the use of fragments that large may have been overrated in the literature as they show limited predictive capacity when used isolatedly.  Given that fragments longer than 9-mers may be disregarded in fragment libraries, there is also the question of whether it is possible to remove other sizes without negatively impacting the overall quality of the final models. There is a significant difference between the results of 3-mers and 9-mers ( p < 0.01), which means that larger fragments cannot reproduce the native structure with the same accuracy as smaller fragments. Nonetheless, 9-mers have been shown to improve model accuracy when combined with fragments of other sizes. Rosetta, for example, is a well-established method for protein structure prediction that traditionally uses 9-mers and 3-mers in their ab initio predictions. However, there are no significant differences between the RMSDs of the models generated by 4-mers to 8-mers ( p = 0.011), suggesting a certain degree of structural redundancy in these fragments. These results could prove valuable for simulations with mixed libraries, ie , libraries that combine several fragment sizes.    Mixed libraries  A series of different works demonstrate the use of fragments of different sizes generates closer to native models [ 14 , 32 ]. In this section, we focus on the analysis of the mixed-size libraries to obtain some insights about how to construct them, based on the results of the tests with the single-size libraries.  Since 3-mers and 9-mers are statistically apart from each other, we selected the 9-mer to represent the ″large fragment‶ and 3-mer to represent the ″short‶. Because 3-mers and 9-mers generate models that are significantly different, we found prudent to bridge the gap between them with a fragment of intermediate size. In view of the fact that fragments with 4 to 8 residues do not produce models that are significantly different, any size is equally fit to be considered ″medium‶. We selected a 6-mer as the medium-sized fragment.  To verify if a mixed library exclusively composed of 3,6,9-mers is adequate to reproduce the native structure, we generated a new set of models and compared them with those produced by mixed libraries with 3-mers to 20-mers. The comparison of the RMSDs of the best models created with 3,6,9-mers shows no significant difference to those created with 3-20-mers ( Fig 2 , p = 0.14), which indicates there is no need to add different sizes and that three different fragment sizes are sufficiently diverse to satisfactorily rebuild the native structure.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g002  Fig 2   Comparison of best models.  3-20: RMSD distribution of the best models assembled by PSI fragments of 3 to 20 residues long. 3,6,9: RMSD distribution of the best models assembled by 3-mers, 6-mers and 9-mers of PSI libraries.     This proves only a few fragment sizes are enough to model the native structure. All other sizes only seem to add structural redundancy without bringing any useful information that is worth a costly extension of the search space. When the Ramachandran plot of 3-mers to 20-mers and 3,6,9-mers are superposed, 3,6,9-mers cover most of the Ramachandran of libraries with sizes 3-20 ( Fig 3 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g003  Fig 3   Ramachandran plot.  Left: Ramachandran plot for 1E0L of PSI libraries 3-20-mers. Middle: Superposition of the Ramachandran plot for 3-20-mers (blue) and 3-mers (purple). Right: Superposition of the Ramachandran plot for 3-20-mers (blue) and 3,6,9-mers (purple). Similar plots are obtained for all the other protein fragment libraries.     In this case, we have shown 3,6,9-mers sufficiently cover the associated fragment conformational space, but this is by no means restricted to this specific combination of fragments. Perhaps other authors may find a different combination of sizes more suitable for a particular PSP methodology. It is also worth mentioning that with the increase of data deposited in the PDB, it is expected the barrier for greatest fragment size to surpass 9. For all evaluations in the following sections, we discarded all fragments other than 3,6,9-mers.  The fact that the majority of the best models are obtained with mixed libraries indicates that mixed libraries combine desirable properties of longer and shorter fragments [ 19 , 20 , 23 , 33 , 34 ]. Despite the disadvantages of 9-mers when compared to 3-mers and 6-mers, our findings suggest they have desirable, seemingly indispensable properties for better model accuracy when used in combination with different fragment sizes. Considering that it is theoretically possible to obtain a 9-mer by stringing three 3-mers, it seems counterintuitive that models built exclusively from 3-mers do not have the same quality of those built from mixed libraries. This is because simply adding 3-mers together does not necessarily lead to a naturally existing, clash-free 9-mer. Moreover, if there are 200 fragments per position and three positions, searching the correct 9-mer from a set of 3-mers requires 200 3 evaluations instead of 200 evaluations.  In a previous work by Handl and collaborators [ 25 ] it was shown that longer fragments worked well for most proteins, which lead to the suggestion that small fragments such as 3-mers should be derived from the longer. However, extracting shorter fragments from the longer could greatly scale down structural diversity, thus undermining the usefulness of short fragments. Our simulations with the mixed libraries corroborate there is no ideal fragment size. Rather, the best approach seems to be the combination of different sizes, as it allows shorter fragments to compensate for shortcomings of the longer, and vice-versa.  The superiority of the mixed libraries is confirmed by the tests for which single-length libraries were incapable of generating proper protein models ( Fig 4 ). Whereas models up to 50 residues built from 3-mers have approximately the same quality of those built from mixed libraries, the RMSDs for models built exclusively from 3-mers increase greatly with the target length ( Fig 4 ). Such significant loss of quality is not observed for the mixed libraries.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g004  Fig 4   RMSDs of the best models.  Comparison of the RMSD of the best models built only from 3-mers (upper left), only 6-mers (upper right), only 9-mers (bottom left) and 9,6,3-mers (bottom right).     As mixed libraries contain fragments of all three sizes, it is important to describe how these fragments are used to built the best models. We observed that the best models constructed with mixed libraries were obtained by assembling 9-mers, followed by 6-mers and finally 3-mers ( Fig 5 , S1 Fig ). In the course of the simulations with mixed libraries, 9-mers are especially inserted during the first stage of the optimization, because they bring more empirical information into the model, enabling the optimization algorithm to bias the structure towards the global minimum basin. However, 9-mers are expected to become less useful as the model approaches the native conformation possibly because they might cause structural changes that are inconvenient for the latter stages of the algorithm when more subtle changes are required.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g005  Fig 5   Relative frequency of fragment insertion.  The bars show the relative amount of use of each fragment size (9-mers, 6-mers and 3-mers) in different stages of the algorithm when mixed libraries are used.     As the simulation progresses, smaller fragments begin to play a major role, and in contrast, 9-mers start losing their importance. Because the global optimization is implemented to take into consideration the whole structure, the fragments used in this stage are somewhat likely to avoid radical conformational changes. Thus, smaller fragments become more suitable for PSP methods. As 6-mers are the most used fragments during global optimization, they apparently represent the best trade-off between the amount of information brought by larger fragments while still allowing for the minimal perturbation that is expected of smaller fragments.  As previously stated, the further into the simulation, the smaller was the fragment size, so it was expected that the final stage was characterized by the predominance of the smallest of all sizes, the 3-mer. In fact, the algorithm inserted 3-mers almost exclusively, indicating they are ideal to local structural refinement ( Fig 5 , S1 Fig ).    Use of secondary structure prediction  To verify how useful secondary structure prediction is for fragment libraries, we compared the models created by assembling fragments ranked according to sequence similarity alone (BLO) and fragments that combine sequence similarity and secondary structure prediction (PSI).  Secondary structure prediction is widely used by nearly all the successful PSP methods as it has been found to unequivocally ameliorate model quality. Thence, it came as a surprise that the majority of our PSI libraries models are less accurate than the BLO models (Figs 6 and 7 , S1 Table ). It is important to notice that this is true regardless of the quality of PSIPRED prediction even when its success rate is close to 100% ( Fig 8 ). Certainly, PSI models are expected to have lower quality when the PSIPRED predictions are inaccurate, as is the case with 1AMB, where only 14% of the PSIPRED prediction is correct, but PSIPRED had over 50% success ratio for all tested proteins.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g006  Fig 6   RMSDs of the best models.  Models were built from a combination of different fragments length (9, 6 and 3-residues long) and scores (BLOSUM62, shown in white; PSIPRED+BLOSUM62, in gray).      10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g007  Fig 7   Best models obtained with the simulations with the mixed libraries.

If the difference is greater than zero ( Dif RMSD > 0) it means the use of PSIPRED is harmful to the prediction. Diff RMSD = Difference between the RMSD of PSI and BLO62 models.     The quality loss of the PSI models compared to BLO models despite the high rate of success in PSIPRED predictions strongly indicates the exclusion of essential fragments and raises questions over the ubiquitous use of secondary structure prediction in fragment selection.  Are there any advantages in using secondary structure prediction in a PSP method? The search space of the problem of assembling a native structure from overlapping fragments consists of the many combinations of the dihedral angles found in the library. When fragment selection is biased by PSIPRED, a library with less structural diversity is created ( Fig 9 ), so it spans a narrower search space. Despite the loss of desirable fragments, a more limited search space allows optimization algorithms to perform better.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g009  Fig 9   Secondary structure distribution profile for Profrager generated libraries with fragments containing 3 and 9 residues, target T0551.  The horizontal axes represent each residue in the sequence. Vertical axes show secondary structure percentages among the fragments at each residue (position): H = helix, C = coil and E = extended. Left panel: BLO libraries built using only sequence similarity. Right panel: PSI libraries built using sequence similarity score and secondary structure prediction agreement score. These graphics are automatically generated by Profrager.     The fragments were clustered based on their structural similarity to evaluate to which extent the use of secondary structure prediction allows the optimization algorithm to constrain the search space and how it influences protein modeling. Structural clustering consists in grouping the fragments according to a distance function (e.g.: RMSD, DME) when the value is within a cutoff. The expectation is to reduce the search space with a negligible loss in accuracy. The libraries were clustered by structural similarity, and new models were built using only the fragments with the greatest score from each cluster (referred to as leader ).  Since PSI libraries are structurally less diverse, clustered PSI libraries resulted in approximately half the number of leaders of the BLO libraries ( Fig 10 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g010  Fig 10   Number of clusters for each single-sized library of 3-mers, 6-mers, 9-mers.     There is a minor loss (at most 1.39 Å, Table 1 ) in accuracy when models are generated using only leaders, but such loss is compensated by the notable reduction of the search space from 200 fragments per residue to approximately 20 ( Fig 10 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.t001  Table 1   RMSD difference between models from clustered and unclustered libraries.

While most state-of-the-art protein structure prediction software use one or more secondary structure prediction methods, our previous results of unclustered PSI and BLO ( Fig 6 ) shows that the use of secondary structure prediction has no effect in selecting better fragments. However, clustered PSI libraries resulted in fewer clusters while maintaining similar accuracy when compared to BLO models. In a template-free prediction scenario, the use of PSIPRED allows the optimization algorithm to explore the conformational landscape more efficiently due to the resulting smaller number of clustered fragments.  By comparing the results of clustered and unclustered libraries, we suggest that the use of secondary structure prediction does not rank fragments in a way that selects closest-to-native local conformations. Instead, we suggest the use of secondary structure prediction is relevant to PSP methods because it effectively reduces the search space by sparing only the fragments with a similar secondary structure. The fact that BLO unclustered libraries are superior to PSI unclustered libraries indicates that occasionally the use of PSIPRED sacrifices potentially relevant fragments. However, regarding cost-effectiveness, using PSIPRED for fragment selection is a beneficial strategy due to the relatively smaller number of clusters obtained from PSI libraries.    Validating libraries with Rosetta  As Profrager outputs files that are compatible with Rosetta, Rosetta was used to simulate a real ab initio scenario with BLO, PSI (9,3-mers, as used by Rosetta) and Robetta fragments. Robetta libraries were built using the Robetta server ( http://robetta.bakerlab.org/fragmentsubmit.jsp ).

PSI: built using sequence similarity score and secondary structure prediction agreement (PSIPRED library). Robetta: libraries built using Robetta server.     The comparison of the GDT-TS of the best structures created by Rosetta shows no statistical difference between PSI and Robetta ( p = 0.37). This means PSI libraries, generated by Profrager, are a suitable replacement for Robetta as they allowed Rosetta to model the native structure with similar accuracy. Moreover, the rate of correct secondary structures (given by STRIDE [ 35 ]) is indistinguishable in practice for these libraries. ( Fig 11 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.g011  Fig 11   Ratio of correct secondary structures.  Percentage of residues with the correct secondary structure in each fragment library of 3-mers (left) and 9-mers (right). For each residue, on the native structure, its secondary structure is compared to all corresponding fragments from the libraries.     Although BLO fragments were shown to potentially lead to better results ( Fig 6 ), the comparison of the GDT-TS of Robetta and BLO (ANOVA, p = 0.0007) shows a significant difference. These results confirm that, in a real ab initio scenario, fragment selection is better when biased by secondary structure prediction due to the limitations of the search algorithm. This suggests that the full potential of BLO libraries could not be fully explored by the protocol used by Rosetta and corroborate the view that secondary structure prediction is of special importance in current prediction methods.  Despite the inferior results of the BLO fragments, our analysis of the accuracy of secondary structures demonstrate that the advantages brought by ranking fragments with the aid of PSIPRED are limited to structured regions ( Fig 11 ). Both PSI and Robetta use secondary structure prediction to assemble their fragment libraries, and both had better results for helices and extended conformations (strands) when compared to BLO. Contrastingly, BLO libraries are more accurate in coil regions. Better results in structured regions are obtained when the fragment selection relies on secondary structure prediction (e.g.: PSI, Robetta), but such libraries are prone to exhibit a noticeably smaller structural diversity, to a point where some positions have only one type of secondary structure ( Fig 9 ). Such limited fragment diversity apparently interfered with their ability to model coils correctly, making BLO the proper library for the task of modeling regions that are rich in loops, such as some binding sites.  A useful fragment library should contain all possible conformational states for a local segment of the target protein, albeit without making the search space unfeasible. Local conformational diversity is a desirable trait, as it increases the chance of sampling the correct structure, but too many fragments may cause the search space to become too large for the search algorithm. In short, every position should have as few fragments as possible, but not fewer. Thence, the ideal fragment library combines both BLO and PSI fragments but uses PSI fragments to rebuild regions rich in helices and sheets, while leaving loops to be modeled by BLO fragments.     Methods  One of the most well-known servers for fragment libraries creation is the Robetta server [ 36 , 37 ] ( http://robetta.bakerlab.org/fragmentsubmit.jsp ), which has proven useful for protein structure prediction and protein structure design. However, Robetta does not allow for the customization level we seek to assess in this work, such as varying scoring functions, different fragment sizes and fragment selection method. Therefore, we developed a highly customizable method for fragment library generation to be used by prediction methods. Different fragment libraries can be generated for a target sequence depending on the customization options, which include (i) fragment selection criterion, (ii) fragment length and (iii) number of fragments per library.   Fragment library creation  The PISCES (Protein Sequence Culling Server [ 38 ]) was initially used to extract a non-redundant, and non-homologous, subset of 4365 structures (X-Ray or NMR-determined, 2.0 Å or better resolution) from the RSCB PDB data bank. We used a strict criterion of at most 20% sequence similarity to construct the database. Thus, structural diversity is guaranteed by avoiding the selection of several fragments from homologous proteins.  Fragment libraries were created using the software Profragger ( www.lncc.br/sinapad/Profrager/ ). Each residue is represented by three dihedral angles ( ϕ , ψ and ω ) and three bond angles [ 23 ] (N-C α -C, C α -C-N, and C-N-C α ) extracted from the non-redundant database. Fragments were excised exclusively from structures non-homologous to the target sequence (PSIBLAST E-value > 0.05).  Fragment libraries are expected to comprise fragments from non-homologous structures that correctly model a sequential, local segment. Profrager searches the best local structures by aligning overlapping fragment sequences with the query sequence and estimates the likelihood of the fragment via an amino acid substitution matrix. Although Profrager allows the user free choice of the substitution matrix, in this work, we used the BLOSUM62 matrix as it is the de facto matrix for protein alignment.  Profrager creates a list starting at every residue of the target sequence, resulting in n-f+1 lists for a target sequence, where n is the number of residues and f is the fragment length. Each list contains 200 fragments that better fit the local structure according to the scoring function. For the sake of comparison, two different scoring functions were used to select the fragments. The first function estimates the likelihood of local fit according to the sequence similarity between the target and the fragment sequences. This similarity is given by the BLOSUM62 matrix entries for each pair of residues. ∑  i  =  1  n  B  (  t  i  ,  f  i  )  (1) where B is the value of BLOSUM62 for the residue pair, t i is the i th residue of the target sequence, f i is the i th residue of the fragment, and n is the number of residues of the fragment.  The second function tested combines the sequence similarity score with the agreement between the fragment structure prediction for the target sequence, using the PSIPRED prediction confidence ( Eq 2 ). ∑  i  =  1  n  P  (  t  i  ,  f  i  )  ,  P  (  t  i  ,  f  i  )  :  c  i  ,  if  s  s  f  i  (  H  ,  E  ,  C  )  =  s  s  t  i  (  H  ,  E  ,  C  )  -  c  i  ,  else  (2) where ssf i (H,E,C) is the secondary structure observed experimentally for the i th residue of the fragment (given by STRIDE), sst i (H,E,C) is the secondary structure predicted to the i th residue of the target sequence, c i is the PSIPRED confidence, t i is the i th residue of the target sequence.  The final score is calculated according to Eq (3)  ∑  i  =  1  n  B  (  t  i  ,  f  i  )  +  P  (  t  i  ,  f  i  )  (3)  The weights of B() and P() were determined via trial runs, where some proteins were selected and 10 runs of the algorithm were performed. The best RMSDs were obtained when the weights were 1:1 ( S2 Table ).  Robetta creates two different sets of fragments for each overlapping position of 3 and 9 residues long, respectively. As Profrager creates fragments of any size, we introduced a fragment of intermediate size (6-mers) because the distance between 3 and 9 is too broad.  For each fragment length, two different ranks were used: the first uses only the sequence similarity score given by Eq (1) and the second uses the score given by Eq (3) . As it is a common practice by many PSP algorithms to combine fragments of different lengths, we also investigated the effects of using mixed libraries , containing the three fragment lengths.    Model construction by fragments assembly  A greedy algorithm was used to assemble the native structure solely from overlapping fragments to evaluate the most fundamental aspects of better fragment libraries. A cost-function based on the protein structure was used as it allows fast convergence towards the native structure.   Cost function  The Distance Matrix Error (DME, Eq 4 ) is used as the cost-function. DME = ∑ i = 1 , j > i N ( p i j − q i j ) 2 N ( N − 1 ) 2 ,  (4) where N is the number of backbone atoms (N, C α and C) and p ij (respectively, q ij ) denotes the distance between atoms i and j on the predicted (respectively, experimental) structure.  Two versions of DME are used in different stages of the algorithm. The local DME refers to the DME of a section of the protein, for example, a fragment of 9 residues at some position, while the global DME is the DME of the whole structure.    Search algorithm  For a n -residue long protein, there are 200 n-f+1 models that may result from all the possible combinations of the f -residue long fragments in a library, making an exhaustive approach unfeasible even for the smallest proteins. We developed a greedy algorithm to assemble the fragments in the close-to-native model, that is composed of three different stages (i) local optimization; (ii) global optimization and (iii) refinement.  The protein starts from a stretched conformation, that is, the backbone dihedral angles are set to 180°. One position on the target sequence is randomly selected and the fragment that minimizes local DME is inserted. The fragment insertion consists in replacing the backbone dihedral and bond angles of the model by those of the fragment. Another position is randomly selected among the positions left, and its fragments are tested for local fit.  start    until stop criterion     while j < n residues      select random position among n-j      while i < n fragments       evaluate fragment i       if DME local , current < DME local , best        insert fragment       end if      end while     end while  end  For the global optimization, the algorithm was modified to allow the structure to escape local minima and sample other possible conformations. This is done by testing fragments for two different positions at the same time, and inserting both if the global DME is improved. The global optimization can be summarized as follows: two positions are randomly selected and one fragment is randomly chosen for each position. For each two selected positions, 200 pairs are tested for global DME and the pair that minimizes the global DME is inserted. These positions are marked so they are not sampled again, and two new positions are randomly selected. After the entire sequence has been sampled, the global optimization restarts using the model built as a starting point. The stop criterion is fulfilled when DME is not updated after an iteration, i.e., if the algorithm runs through the entire target sequence and does not insert any pair.  start    until stop criterion     while j < n residues      select two random positions (a, b) among n-j      while i < 200       randomly select fragment a and fragment b       evaluate fragments       if DME local , current < DME local , best        insert fragments       end if      end while     end while  end  Even though the protein is already folded in a close-to-native conformation after the global optimization, the model can usually be further refined. We introduced a refinement stage that is similar to the local optimization, but the cost-function used is the global DME instead of local DME. The algorithm starts with the conformation left by the global optimization and randomly selects a position of the target sequence. All the 200 fragments are tested for global fit, and the best is inserted. The selected position is marked not to be repeated and a new position is randomly selected. After all positions have been selected, the algorithm restarts with the conformation left by the previous iteration and repeats the procedure. The stop criterion is fulfilled when global DME is not updated after an iteration.  When mixed libraries are used, few modifications are introduced on the standard algorithm. A fragment length is randomly selected at the beginning of each stage. The optimization is then performed using only the fragments of the selected length. A new fragment length is then randomly chosen among the options left and the optimization is performed again. For each optimization stage, each fragment library is used only once, in random order.  For each library, 30 runs of the optimization algorithm were performed.     Fragment clustering  To reduce the search space, we used an algorithm to cluster fragments and verified the effect of rebuilding the native structure solely from the fragments with the highest score in each cluster (called cluster leader ).  A DME cutoff distance is defined and each fragment is compared to the leader in descending score order. If a fragment does not meet the cutoff, it becomes the leader of a new group; if a fragment meets the cutoff with any existing leaders, it leaves the library and is represented by that leader. This procedure is carried out for each target sequence position. We adopted a DME cutoff of 0.05, 0.7 and 1.5 Å for the 3-mers, 6-mers and 9-mers, respectively.   Test set  Tests were carried out in a set of 20 proteins divided among mainly- α , mainly- β and α + β classes, ranging from 20 to 129 residues ( Table 3 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170131.t003  Table 3   Test set.

It is only possible to test Profrager 9-mers and 3-mers as these are the only fragment sizes used by Robetta.  A set of 48 proteins ranging from 54 to 148 residues was selected from the CASP9 experiment ( Table 2 ) and for each we generated 1000 models using the ab initio -relax protocol (Rosetta v3.4). The quality of the structures was evaluated by GDT-TS (Global Distance Test Total Score [ 39 , 40 ], given by TM-score [ 41 , 42 ]) and only the best model (greater GDT-TS) was considered during comparisons.    Statistical test  In each test, the best models for each protein were compared. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with the aid of Scipy package (v.0.18.1-1) for the Python language (v.3.5.2). The corresponding p-values for each test are cited on the Results section. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.01.     Conclusion  Despite the fact that fragment libraries are commonly used in protein structure prediction, some of its underlying features have never been fully investigated. To have a clearer view of how distinct factors associated to fragment generation and use affect protein structure prediction, we isolated the process of model building by fragment assembly from some common limitations associated with prediction methods, e.g., imprecise energy functions and optimization algorithms, by employing an exact structure-based objective function under a greedy algorithm.  Firstly, we assessed the effect of varying fragment sizes in libraries and found that, when considered separately, shorter fragments produce better models than longer fragments. Notwithstanding, combining fragments of all sizes into a mixed library proved to be the best strategy. When mixed libraries are used, longer fragments are invaluable at the beginning of the simulation because they bring more empirical information into the model. These findings suggest the best approach is to use a library with different fragment sizes and to diminish their size as the simulation advances to fully exploit them.  A library composed of 3,6,9-mers has the potential to reproduce the native structure with the same degree of accuracy of a library with fragments of sizes 1 to 20 residues. There is a high degree of structural redundancy among fragments of similar sizes, which makes it possible to remove them from the library and, by consequence, to explore the search space more thoroughly.  Secondly, the fragment libraries were evaluated regarding the fragment selection criteria. Fragments could be selected exclusively by sequence similarity given by a BLOSUM62 score (BLO libraries) or by combining the BLOSUM62 score to the secondary structure prediction confidence provided by PSIPRED (PSI libraries). The former approach yielded closest to native models. Despite the common reliance on PSIPRED predictions, our results strongly indicate that its use in fragment ranking can exclude useful fragments, thus casting reservations on the widespread utilization of secondary structure prediction for fragment libraries construction.  Libraries assembled with the aid of PSIPRED were found to be less diverse, and while they may exclude some useful fragments, they allow better structural clustering and a much greater reduction of the search space. The relatively smaller number of clusters of PSI libraries shows that using secondary structure prediction for fragment selection is more suitable to an optimization problem where the conformational sampling is the main limiting aspect of the model construction process, as is the case of ab initio prediction.  Finally, though lacking conformational diversity PSI libraries can lead to better results in structured regions (helices and sheets). Altogether, these results suggest that fragment libraries should couple PSI and BLO fragments to model structured regions and loops, respectively.  Profrager PSI libraries proved to be a suitable replacement for Robetta, as it generates fragment libraries that allow Rosetta to recreate the native structure with similar accuracy.  The results shown will guide the development of strategies for generation and use of fragment libraries in our protein structure prediction methods [ 43 ]. Furthermore, these results prompt the development of novel strategies to build fragment libraries by mixing the best features of sequence similarity based and secondary structure based libraries. Such strategy could be the construction of a library that increases the weight of the sequence similarity score in regions where the probability of coils is detected to be high. Another possible approach could be the use of a multi-objective strategy to select the fragments, such as a Pareto strategy.

Dittrichia viscosa (L . ) W . Greuter is a pioneer species belonging to the Compositae family. It is widespread in the Mediterranean basin, where it is considered invasive. It is a source of secondary metabolites, playing an important ecological role. D . viscosa plant extracts showed a phytotoxic activity on several physiological processes of different species. In the current study, the allelopathic potential of D . viscosa VOCs, released by its foliage, was evaluated on seed germination and root growth of lettuce. The VOCs effect was also studied on lettuce adult plants in microcosm systems, which better mimicked the open field conditions. D . viscosa VOCs inhibited both seed germination and root growth of lettuce. The VOCs composition revealed a large presence of terpenoids, responsible of the effects observed. Moreover, D . viscosa VOCs caused an alteration on plant water status accompanied by oxidative damages and photoinhibition on lettuce adult plants.

Greuter (syn . Inula viscosa (L . ) Aiton ., Cupularia viscosa G . et G . ) is an evergreen perennial shrubby-weed belonging to the family Compositae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and it is considered a ruderal species due to its abundance in anthropic altered areas [ 1 ], and in particular, in metal-polluted sites [ 2 ]. D . viscosa has a remarkable pioneer nature since it colonizes different habitats in the Mediterranean basin where it often creates large monospecific communities [ 3 ]. In Australian and some European countries, this species is considered an important environmental weed for its high seed production and spreading, and for its resistance/adaptation to adverse conditions [ 3 , 4 ]. D . viscosa is characterized by a quite substantial root apparatus and the ratio between below- and above-ground biomass is 0.24 [ 5 ]. The canopy is very dense reaching 150 cm of height and total leaf area per plant comprises 200 cm 2 [ 6 ]. Glandular hairs, which produce a sticky resin from which derives “viscosa” name, cover the entire plant conferring its strong typical fragrance [ 3 ].  D . viscosa has allelopathic potential and, in particular, its extracts caused phytotoxic effects on several species, inhibiting roots and causing root anatomical abnormalities [ 7 ]. Interestingly, these extracts did not cause autotoxicity phenomenon conferring to this species a competitive advantage over other species [ 8 ]. Moreover, leaf epicuticular substances were also considered strong allelopatic agents for N 2 -fixing soil cyanobacteria, decreasing dramatically the photosynthetic assimilation of CO 2 and increasing the heterocyst-to-vegetative cell ratio and most likely the assimilation of N 2 of the cyanobacteria [ 9 ]. Finally, the effect of several extracts was assayed on crops and weeds, pointing out that D . viscosa allelopathic potential seems to be attributed mainly to leaf leachate [ 10 ]. This effect could be attributable to the presence of many secondary metabolites such as flavonoids [ 11 ], sesquiterpene lactones and acids [ 12 – 14 ] and triterpenoids [ 15 , 16 ], biologically active compounds. In particular, formulated leaf extracts of D . viscosa exhibited nematicidal [ 17 , 18 ], insecticidal [ 19 , 20 ] antifungal [ 21 , 22 ] activity.  Although many information is available regarding the in-vitro phytotoxic potential of the D . viscosa extracts, the activity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), released by foliage, was never assessed. The presence of allelochemicals in aromatic shrub has been already established [ 23 ] playing a pivotal role especially in arid and semi-arid conditions where they act in the vapor phase [ 23 , 24 ]. Several studies demonstrated that plant volatiles are potent seed germination inhibitors, reducing seedling establishment and growth in ecosystems [ 25 – 27 ]. For example, the VOCs produced by Artemisia vulgaris [ 26 , 28 ], Calamintha nepeta or perennial groundcovers [ 29 – 32 ] suppressed weed seedling growth.  The VOCs are generally composed by terpenes, which provide to species a large number of ecological advantages [ 33 ] including plant reproduction, pollinator attractants, herbivores protection and plant–plant communication. These features make these compounds determinants for the vegetation patterning [ 34 , 35 ].  In the current paper, the allelopathic potential of D . viscosa VOCs, naturally released from its foliage, was assessed on Lactuca sativa L. The VOCs effect was assayed on seed germinatin and root growth of lettuce. Furthermore, the response of lettuce adult plants to VOCs was also studied in microcosm systems, in order to better mimic the open field conditions. Furthermore, the metabolome profile of lettuce adult plants, in response to VOCs released by a donor species, was here analyzed for the first time.    Materials and Methods   Plant material  Aerial parts of D . viscosa were sampled on September 2015 in Calabria (Southern Italy). The plant material was collected in experimental fields belonging to the University Mediterranea of Reggio Calabria (Italy) (latitude N 38°7’ 40.883”, longitude E 15°40’ 36.375”) and its collection did not require any specific permission.    In vitro VOCs bioassays  The in vitro volatiles bioassay was carried out as previously described by Araniti et al. [ 29 ], with some modifications. Freshly harvested greenish branches were evaluated for the bioactive volatile activity allowing only atmospheric contact between the test and the donor species. The aerial parts (0, 25, 50, 100 and 200 g of entire branches) of D . viscosa (donor species) were daily collected and immediately placed on the bottom of a 4.5 L jar capped with a plastic net ( S1 Fig ). A Petri dish (6 cm Ø) was filled with a double layer of filter paper, moistened with 2 ml of sterile deionized water and gently laid on a porous surface on the top of cut plant material ( S1 Fig ). The jar was then transferred in a ventilated climatic chamber settled with a temperature of 25±1°C and a 16:8 (light:dark) photoperiod. For each petri dish, 10 sterilized seeds of L . sativa L. (var. Parris Island COS), were sown. Germinated seeds were counted every 6 hours for 48 hr, considering germinated those seeds showing ≥ 1 mm of root protrusion from seed coat. According to Chiapusio et al. (1997), at the end of the observations, the total germination rate [G T (%)] and the average speed of germination (S) were calculated as follow:   Total germination rate:       G T   ( % ) = 100 * ( N T / N )     where T indicates the last observation and N is the total number of seeds sown.   Average speed of germination:       S = ( N 1 * 1 ) +   1 / 2 ( N 2 − N 1 ) + 1 / 3   ( N 3 − N 2 ) + …. + 1 / n   ( N n − N n − 1 )     where N 1 , N 2 , N 3 , N n-1 , N n is the number of germinated seeds at each counting time.  Root growth [TRL (cm)] was evaluated on five pre-germinated seedlings, grown as previously described for seed germination, after 48 hr of treatment. D . viscosa plant material was daily changed to mimic field conditions.   Head space GC-MS analysis of plant volatiles  The D . viscosa VOCs were chemically characterized using a Thermo Fisher gas chromatograph apparatus (Trace 1310) equipped with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer (ISQ LT). The capillary column was a TG-5MS 30 m×0.25 mm×0.25μm the gas carrier was helium with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Injector and source were settled at 200°C and 260°C, respectively. The sample (1 g of fresh plant material) was incubated for 1 minute at 40° and 1 μl of the head space was injected in split mode with a split ratio of 60. The following temperature was programmed: isocratic for 7 minutes at 45°C, from 45°C to 80°C with a rate of 10°C×min, from 80°C to 200°C with a rate of 20°C×min, then isocratic for 3 minutes 200°C. Mass spectra were recorded in electronic impact (EI) mode at 70 eV, scanning at 45–500 m/z range. Compounds identification was carried out comparing the relative retention time and mass spectra of molecules with those of the libraries (NIST 2005, Wiley 7.0 etc.).     Bioassays on adult plants   VOCs bioassay on adult plants  The VOCs bioassay on lettuce adult plants was carried out as previously described [ 36 ]. Lettuce plants (30 days old) were exposed to D . viscosa VOCs, produced by 50 g of living plant material, for 12 days. During this period plants were daily irrigated with a half strength Hoagland solution. As for germination and root growth bioassays, D . viscosa plant material was daily renewed.    Photosynthetic pigments and Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements  Chlorophyll a (Chl a ), chlorophyll b (Chl b ), and carotenoids (Ct) content were determined according to Wellburn [ 37 ]. In particular, 100 mg of frozen plant material were extracted with 1.5 ml of pure methanol and centrifuged at 170 g at 4°C for 5 min. Five hundred μL of supernatant were then collected and diluted with 500 μL of methanol. The absorbance of the pigment extract was determined at 470, 653, 666 and 750 nm. Pigment content was evaluated according to Wellburn’s equations [ 37 ].  The fluorescence of the chlorophyll a emitted by plants (three per treatment) exposed to VOCs was determined as described by Araniti et al. [ 36 ] with some modifications. Chlorophyll fluorescence was monitored using the Maxi-Imaging-PAM Chlorophyll Fluorescence System fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany), and monitored every three days for 12 days. The following parameters were calculated: the maximum quantum efficiency of dark-adapted photosystem II (F v /F m ); the maximum quantum efficiency of lighted photosystem II ( Φ II ); the regulated energy dissipation in the form of heat ( Φ NPQ ); the nonregulated energy dissipation ( Φ NO , fluorescence emitted) and the estimated electron transport rate (ETR). The photosynthetic response was monitored for 5 min, and fifteen measurements were obtained for each parameter at each measuring time.    In situ semi-quantitative determination of H 2 O 2  Hydrogen peroxide was determined according to Araniti et al. [ 38 ] with some modifications. Four fully expanded leaves were cut and fixed for 8 h in 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (1 mg mL -1 ) solution (pH 3.8). The incubation was carried out in dark condition and pigments were successively removed rinsing leaves twice in pure ethanol. Bleached leaves were stored in 80% glycerol. Stained areas were determined by image analysis with the software Image ProPlus v.6.0 (Media Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA).    Lipid peroxidation  Lipid peroxidation was determined as described by Araniti et al. [ 36 ], measuring the increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the sample. Liquid nitrogen powdered plant material (100 mg) was homogenized in 80% cold ethanol solution (1 ml) and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and incubated for 25 minutes at 95°C with 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) containing 0.01% hydroxytoluenebutylate, with and without 0.5% thiobarbituric acid (TBA). After incubation, the reaction was stopped in ice and the samples were centrifuged at 3000 g at 15°C for 10 minutes. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 440, 532 and 600 nm.  The equivalents of MDA were calculated using the equations proposed by Hodges et al. [ 39 ].    Total protein content  Total protein content of lettuce leaves exposed for 12 days to D . viscosa VOCs was determined according to Bradford [ 40 ], using bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein content was expressed as micrograms per gram of dry weight.    Fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), DW/FW ratio, leaf relative water content (RWC), leaf osmotic potential [Ψ (π)] and leaf membrane stability index [MSI (%)]  At the end of the experiment, four plants were collected and their FW was evaluated. Plants were oven dried for one week at 60°C in order to get DW and to calculate DW/FW ratio parameter.  Leaf relative water content (RWC) was estimated as previously reported by Mullan and Pietragalla [ 41 ] with some modifications. One leaf for each replicate was weighted (FW) and incubated for 24 h at 4°C in 50 ml falcon tube filled with 15 ml of ultrapure water. After incubation the turgid weight (TW) was taken and leaf samples were transferred in an oven and dried at 60°C for 48 h and successively weighted (DW). RWC parameter was evaluated using the following equation:     R W C = [ ( F W − D W ) / ( T W − D W ) ] * 100     Leaf Ψπ was measured at the end of the experiment on four leaves per treatment (0 and 50 g cut plant material) as described by Araniti et al. [ 36 ]. Lettuce leaves were collected and frozen at -20°C. After 24 hours, leaves were squeezed into a syringe (the first drop was thrown away), the extract was collected and the Ψπ was measured with a cryoscopic osmometer (Osmomat 030, Gonatec).  The MSI was determined indirectly as reported by Saìram et al. [ 42 ] with some modifications. Leaf discs with uniform size were transferred in falcon tubes containing 10 ml of ultrapure water and heated at 30°C for 30 minutes. Then electrical conductivity was measured (C1) and the samples were immediately transferred at 100°C, for 30 minutes. Samples were cooled in ice and the electric conductivity was newly measured (C2). MSI index was obtained using the following equation:     S I   ( % ) = ( 1 −   C 1 / C 2 ) * 100       Extraction, identification and quantification of primary metabolites in lettuce leaves  Extraction, identification, and quantification of metabolites from lettuce leaves were performed as reported by Shi et al. [ 43 ], whereas sample derivatization were performed as Lisec et al. [ 44 ]. The derivatizated extract was injected into a TG-5MS capillary column using the single quadrupole gas chromatographer coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) (Thermo Fisher), as previously described.  Injector and source were settled at 250°C and 260°C temperature, respectively. One μl of sample was injected in splitless mode with a flow of 1ml/min using the following programmed temperature: isothermal 5 min at 70°C followed by a 5°C/ min ramp to 350°C and a final 5 min heating at 330°C. Mass spectra were recorded in electronic impact (EI) mode at 70 eV, scanning at 45–500 m/z range.  The extracted metabolites were identified comparing every retention time index-specific mass with reference spectra in mass spectral libraries (NIST 2005, Wiley 7.0 etc.). Relative metabolites quantification was based on a pre-added internal standard (ribitol at 0.02 mg/ml) added during the extraction process.    Experimental design and statistical analysis  A completely randomized design with four replications was applied in all the experiments except for chlorophyll a fluorescence that was replicated 3 times. Data were first checked for normality through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and then tested for homogeneity of variances with the Levene’s test. Differences among group means were statistically evaluated by analysis of variance followed by Least Significant Difference tests (LSD) in the case of homoscedastic data, and by Tamhane’s T2 test in the case of heteroscedastic data ( P ≤ 0.05).  All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS ver . 6.1 software (Insightful Corporation, USA). Speed Germination, Total Germination and Total Root Length responses to different doses of plant material were evaluated by a nonlinear regression model using a log-logistic function in order to calculate the ED 50 values as reported by Araniti et al. [ 45 – 47 ].  Metabolite concentrations were checked for integrity and missing values were replaced with a small positive value (the half of the minimum positive number detected in the data). Data were successively normalized by a pooled sample (Creating a pooled average sample from control groups), transformed through “Log normalization” (to make the metabolite concentration values more comparable among different compounds) and scaled through Pareto-Scaling (mean-centered and divided by the square root of standard deviation of each variable) [ 48 ]. Data were then classified through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), metabolite variations were presented and samples clusterized through a heatmap. Differences between treatments were considered significant when the P ≤ 0.05 (Student’s t -test).  Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed with MetPA, a web-based tool for pathway analysis & visualization metabolomics. MetPA is a module of Metaboanalyst that combines results from powerful pathway enrichment analysis with the pathway topology analysis to help researchers in identifying the most relevant pathways involved in the conditions under study. Compound ID associations were determined by matching to HMDB, PubChem and KEGG. Then, the pathway library, the algorithm for pathway enrichment analysis, and the algorithm for topological analysis were selected and performed to evaluate the possible biological impacts on the perturbed pathways [ 48 ].      Results   Experiments on lettuce seeds and seedlings   In vitro VOCs bioassay  The results pointed out a strong phytotoxic potential of D . viscosa VOCs on both lettuce seeds germination and seedling growth. In particular, chemicals released from plant material strongly reduced, in a dose dependent manner, both speed (S) and total germination (G T ). Interestingly, the S parameter was significantly inhibited (≈ 12%) even at the lower treatment (12.5 g), increasing up to 86% at 100 g of plant material ( Fig 1 ). Conversely, the lowest treatments (12.5 and 25 g) did not affect the G T parameter, while 50 g treatment caused 18% of inhibition, reaching the 82% at 100 g and 100% at the highest concentration ( Fig 1 ). The nonlinear regression fit of both S and G T raw data gave 69.02 g and 71.98 g ED 50 values, respectively ( Fig 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170161.g001  Fig 1   Effects of Dittrichia viscosa volatiles on germination and root growth.

The nonlinear regression fitting of all the dose-response curves pointed out a significance level of P < 0.001. Different letters along the curve indicate statistical differences with P ≤ 0.05 (LSD). AU = arbitrary units. N = 4.     A stimulation of TRL in lettuce root seedlings, at the lowest concentration (12.5 g), was observed, whereas 25 g did not affect this parameter. On the contrary, higher doses strongly affected lettuce root growth causing 41%, 81% and 85% of inhibition at 50 g, 100 g and 200 g of plant material treatment, respectively. The non linear regression fit of TRL raw data pointed out 51.33 g ED 50 value ( Fig 1 ).    Head space GC-MS analysis of plant VOCs  The VOCs characterization released by Dittrichia viscosa leaves allowed the identification of 39 compounds, most of which belong to the terpenoids class ( Table 1 ). In particular 4 aldehyde, 2 alcohols and 1 ester were identified ( Table 1 ). Among terpenes, 16 monoterpenes (among them one monoterpenic ester and three monoterpenic alcohols), 1 homoterpene and 15 sesquiterpenes were identified ( Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170161.t001  Table 1  Chemical characterization of Dittrichia viscosa VOCs.

Experiments on lettuce adult plants   In vivo Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements and photosynthetic pigment content  The monitoring of chlorophyll a fluorescence, emitted by lettuce adult plants exposed to D . viscosa VOC, pointed out strong inhibitory effects on photosynthetic activity (Figs 2 – 4 ). In particular, plants treated showed a high significant reduction on the photochemical quenching Φ II from day 4 (T 2 ) onwards ( Fig 2 ), whereas Φ NPQ parameter was significantly reduced only from day 6 (T 3 ) until the end of the treatment (T 4 ) ( Fig 2 ). Conversely, the fluorescence parameter Φ NO was significantly stimulated after 4 day (T 2 ) of treatment ( Fig 2 ). Finally, both F v /F m and ETR parameters were significantly reduced after 4 days (T 2 ) of treatment onwards ( Fig 3 ). Interestingly, in the treated plants the F v /F m clearly declined in the older peripheral leaves, which viability was irreversibly compromised, while the central vascular bundles and the youngest leaves were not affected ( Fig 4A–4D ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170161.g002  Fig 2   Effects of Dittrichia viscosa volatiles on photochemical quantum yield of the PSII, the quantum yield of light-induced nonphotochemical quenching and chlorophyll fluorescence.

Furthermore, 12 days of VOCs exposition caused a significant reduction of all the pigments content ( Fig 4E ). In particular, chlorophyll a and b were reduced by 23% and 30%, respectively. Interestingly, carotenoids were the most affected by VOCs exposition with 35% of reduction ( Fig 4E ).    FW, DW, DW/FW ratio, RWC, leaf Ψ (π), MSI (%), MDA (%), in situ semi-quantitative determination of H 2 O 2 and protein quantification  Treatment of lettuce adult plants with D . viscosa VOCs (from 50 g plant material), for 12 days, caused 19% of FW reduction but did not significantly affect DW parameter ( Fig 5A and 5B ). Conversely, the DW/FW ratio significantly increased in treated plants (21%) ( Fig 5C ). Furthermore, the treated plants showed 22%, 32%, and 43% of reduction in RWC, protein content and MSI compared to control, respectively ( Fig 5D, 5F and 5H ). However, the Ψ(π) parameter was significantly stimulated (18%) ( Fig 5E ) as well as the lipid peroxidation (≈ 24%), indirectly determined by the increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) ( Fig 5G ). Finally, a high accumulation of H 2 O 2, which was present on almost the 44% of leaf surface, was observed ( Fig 6 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170161.g005  Fig 5   Effects of Dittrichia viscosa VOCs on several morphological and physiological parameters.

Metabolomic experiments  To gain more insights into the modulation of metabolic homeostasis caused by D . viscosa VOCs exposition, GC-MS analysis were performed to identify differentially expressed metabolites. Fifty-four metabolites, including 10 amino acids, 23 organic acids, 9 sugars, 1 sugar acid, 5 sugar alcohols, 3 amines, 2 fatty acid and 1 glycan were examined in non-treated and treated plants.  Metabolomic data were then analyzed through principal component analysis (PCA). In Fig 7A is reported the PCA score plot, which allowed samples separation and outliers detection basing on their metabolite profiles, whereas in Fig 7B is reported the PCA loading plot that allowed the identification of metabolites that contributes to the separation of samples reported on the score plot. This separation between control and treated samples was achieved using the principal components (PCs) PC1 vs PC2, which explained a total variance of 81.9%. In particular, PC1 explained the 71.6% of the variance while PC2 the 10.3%.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170161.g007  Fig 7   PCA analysis carried on the metabolite identified and quantified after Dittrichia viscosa VOCs treatment.

Both score and loading plots were generated using the first two PCs, PC1 vs PC2, with the explained variances shown in brackets; C) Overlay heat map of metabolite profiles in plants exposed to D . viscosa VOCs released by fresh aerial parts in comparison with control plants. Each square represents the effect of plant VOCs on the amount of every metabolite using a false-color scale. Red or green regions indicate increased or decreased metabolite content, respectively.     The PCA loading plot in Fig 7B shows that PC1 was dominated by D-Glucose, L-Aspartic acid and Palmitic acid, whereas PC2 was dominated largely by 3-α-Mannobiose.  PCA and heatmap visualization of metabolomic data showed distinct segregation between the control and the treated plants ( Fig 7 ). Finally, the t-test analysis revealed 35 out of 55 significantly different metabolites between treated and non-treated samples ( S1 Table ).  A detailed analysis concerning the pathways and networks affected by the VOCs treatment was performed by MetPa. The “pathway analysis” of the results allowed to identify treatment impact on plant metabolism. Interestingly, several pathways were significantly affected ( S2 Table ), but the most effective and recurrent effects were mainly related to amino acids and sugars metabolism ( S2 Table and Figs 8 and 9 ). In particular, L-aspartic (Asp) and L-glutamic (Glu) acids were reduced by 80.5% and 67.5%, respectively ( Fig 8 ). Conversely, all the other amino acids were highly stimulated by VOCs exposition ( Fig 8 ). In particular, L-leucine (Leu) and serine (Ser) content was ~ 80% higher than control, whereas an increase ranged between 40% and 63% of isoleucine (Ile), L-threonine (Thr), γ-aminobutiric acid (GABA) and L-valine (Val) content was observed. Finally, proline (Pro) was the most stimulated amino acids reaching values 1.8 folds higher than control ( Fig 8 ). Among the sugars, sucrose (Suc) and glucose (D-Gu) content were reduced by ≈ 37% and 82%, respectively ( Fig 9 ). Similarly, arabinose (25%), β -gentiobiose (3%), D-xylose (23%) and myoinositol (55%) where significantly reduced by the treatment ( Fig 9 ), whereas D-lactose (140%) and Galactinol (5%) content was stimulated ( Fig 9 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170161.g008  Fig 8   Effects of Dittrichia viscosa volatiles on amino acids content.

Discussion  Consistent with previous results [ 9 ], the allelopathic potential of D . viscosa was confirmed through a bioassay that imitated natural environmental conditions of allelochemical VOCs release. For this reason, lettuce seeds, seedlings and adult plants were placed in open containers included in a ventilated growth chamber, and exposed to D . viscosa VOCs, directly released by plant parts. In particular, the effects of D . viscosa VOCs were demonstrated on lettuce seed germination and root growth, physiological processes largely employed to establish the secondary metabolites phytotoxicity [ 49 ] and the allelopathic potential of species [ 50 ].  In vitro results showed that D . viscosa VOCs had a strong inhibitory activity on both seed germination and root growth of lettuce resulting in low ED 50 values. Similar effects were previously reported with Calamintha nepeta VOCs on germination and root growth of both crops and weeds [ 29 ], with Salvia leucophylla VOCs on root apical meristem of Brassica campestris [ 24 ] and with VOCs released by several selected ground covers on seeds [ 31 ]. Moreover, in agreement with several authors [ 51 – 53 ] the results clearly demonstrated that the seedlings establishment is more sensitive than germination to allelochemicals.  The effects of D . viscosa VOCs on seed germination were also analyzed comparing G T (%) and S indexes. In particular, the G T (%) parameter indicated that VOCs inhibited lettuce germination at relatively high concentrations. Conversely, the S index was significantly affected even at low concentrations. Juglone and trans -cinnamic acid caused similar effects on A . thaliana seeds [ 50 ]. The S reduction, which indicates a seed germination delay after VOCs exposure, is an important ecological effect because it represents a competitive advantageous strategy for D . viscosa in an ecosystem [ 54 ]. In fact, the germination delay could compromise, in the early stages of the seedlings life, the survival of the neighboring species. At this stage, a short period of inhibition could strongly reduce the ability of species to compete with others on their establishment [ 55 , 56 ]. This could explain the ability of D . viscosa to create monospecific communities in its habitat.  Phytochemical analysis of D . viscosa VOCs revealed a strong presence of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, well known as allelopathic compounds, able to affect plant growth generally causing oxidative stress followed by a cascade effect on many physiological processes of receptor plants [ 57 ]. Both of them affected mitochondrial respiration [ 58 , 59 ] and microtubule distribution and organization [ 38 , 60 ], destroyed cell membranes [ 61 ] and altered hormone balance and plant water status [ 36 , 62 ]. The sesquiterpenes trans -caryophyllene was able to affect the germination and growth of several weeds as well as of Arabidopsis adult plants inducing the alteration of plant water status [ 36 ]. Graña et al. [ 62 ] observed similar effects with the monoterpene citral. Singh et al. [ 63 ] reported that α- Pinene was able to inhibit root growth of several weeds causing oxidative stress and destroying cell membrane integrity. Moreover, Hussain et al. [ 64 ] demonstrated that the terpenoid artemisinin was able to inhibit photosynthetic efficiency, to cause oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in roots as well as to interfere with calcium and nitrogen content in Arabidopsis .  Moreover, terpenoids, at non-phytotoxic concentrations, might act synergistically and become extremely phytotoxic [ 65 ], corroborating the hypothesis that allelopathic phenomenon is due to the combined action of different molecules, and underlining the complexity of plant interactions in natural- and agro-ecosystems.  Interestingly, the D . viscosa VOCs affected plant bio-membranes through the induction of lipid peroxidation resulting in a reduction of membrane stability (reduced MSI) and the semi-quantitative analysis of H 2 O 2 further confirmed the presence of the oxidative damages. These effects were generally induced by allelochemicals, which inhibited the antioxidant enzymes activity increasing the level of free radicals, and consequently causing membrane lipid peroxidation and membrane potential alteration [ 66 – 70 ].  Under allelochemicals exposure, the oxidative stress was induced by plant water status alteration [ 36 , 62 ]. For example, menthol and camphor, two terpenoids, enhanced the transpiration of Arabidopsis thaliana fully developed rosette dewaxing the lipophilic layers at leaf surface. As consequence, plants showed a dramatic effect characterized by water loss, necrosis and plant death, demonstrating that the lipophilic layers of leaf surface and stomata were primary targets of these monoterpenes [ 71 ]. Conversely, lettuce plants exposed to D . viscosa VOCs were extremely damaged without showing necrosis and/or plant death. This milder effect could be due to the different growth conditions, which ensured a greater air movement to plants avoiding VOCs accumulation.  Nevertheless, as suggested by Shultz et al. [ 71 ], high content and variability on terpenoids released by D . viscosa VOCs could affect leaf water status of lettuce, FW, DW/FW ratio, accompanied by the RWC reduction and the increase of Ψπ, typical of water status alteration.  The metabolomic profile of treated plants further confirmed this hypothesis, showing a high impact on amino acidic pathways, which results in an increment of several amino acids content, involved in osmotic adjustment. Among them, quaternary ammonium compounds [ 72 – 74 ] and amino acids such as proline, asparagine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [ 75 – 77 ] play a pivotal role in the recovery of plants from stress [ 77 ] such as osmotic stress [ 78 – 80 ]. In particular, proline accumulates to high levels in species adapted to arid and saline environments, in plant tissues withstanding severe desiccation, in response to allelochemicals [ 36 , 62 , 81 , 82 ] and in cellular redox regulation, protecting proteins and membranes and scavenging reactive oxygen species [ 83 , 84 ]. As well as proline, GABA, involved in many plant responses to stress, such as nitrogen storage, pH regulation, plant defense and osmotic adjustments [ 85 ], increased in treated plants. High increment of both proline and GABA could be correlated with the reduction of glutamic acid, a precursor of their synthesis [ 85 , 86 ]. Indeed, previous experiments carried out with labeled ( 14 C) gluthamic acid pointed out that water stressed shoots of bermuda grass readily accumulated much more proline newly synthesized from glutamic acid [ 87 ]. As well as glutamic acid, the aspartic acid content was also significantly reduced in plants exposed to D . viscosa VOCs, while a significant increment of its derivative threonine and isoleucine was observed. Previous studies demonstrated that aspartic acid and the derivative lysine, threonine and isoleucine represented building blocks for stress-specific proteins [ 88 – 90 ], allowing to justify their fluctuation in treated plants.  Interestingly, significant increase in leucine, valine concentration as well as in isoleucine, observed in treated plants, generally occurred under protein degradation, as in aged leaves before abscission or in plant cell resting cultures [ 91 , 92 ].  Finally, oxidative stress, sucrose content reduction and strong increase of serine level in leaf suggested that plants are experiencing with the photorespiration rate increase as suggested by Bourguignon et al. [ 93 ]. In particular, serine was strongly involved in the photorespiratory cycle [ 93 ].  Plants exposed to D . viscosa VOCs reduced the levels of chlorophyll a and b as well as carotenoids, which are known to be accessory pigments with the important role as free radical scavengers protecting plants from photoinhibition [ 94 ]. The reduction of these pigments could enhance the ROS-mediated photodegradation of chlorophyll and the induction of photoinhibition [ 94 , 95 ]. Therefore, plants, in order to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from photoinhibition, could adopt two strategies: first, the thermal dissipation of the energy in excess in the PSII antennae (nonphotochemical quenching), and second, the ability of PSII to transfer electrons to various acceptors within the chloroplast (photochemical quenching) [ 96 ]. If plants are not able to apply at least one of the two strategies, photoinhibition occurs. The monitoring of some photosynthetic parameters supported this hypothesis. In fact, plants exposed to D . viscosa VOCs reduced the light adapted photosystem II efficiency (Φ II ) accompanied by an increase in the emission of non-regulated energy dissipation (Φ NO ) and a reduction of the ETR. Moreover, treated plants showed a strong reduction in nonphotochemical quenching (Φ NPQ ), which suggested that plants were not able to dissipate the energy in heat form [ 97 ]. Finally, the progressive reduction of the parameter Fv/Fm suggested a physical damage to the antenna complex, probably due to the high presence of ROS and lipid peroxidation.  Taken together these results suggested that both photochemical and biosynthetic phases of photosynthesis were directly affected by VOCs [ 97 ] and the confirmation was given by the sharp alteration of sugars metabolism and, in particular, by the reduction in sucrose and glucose content observed after treatment. In particular, the reduction in glucose, sucrose content was already observed in Arabidopsis cells exposed to oxidative stress [ 98 ] and in Aegilops geniculate plants treated with ferulic and p -coumaric acids [ 99 ], largely known for affecting photosynthesis [ 100 ].    Conclusions  The results gave the first evidence of the allelopathic potential of D . viscosa through a bioassay that mimed natural environmental conditions of VOCs release. The effects of VOCs on plant-plant interaction and communication were studied through a physiological and metabolomic approach, for the first time.  D . viscosa VOCs have a strong inhibitory activity on both germination and root growth of L . sativa as well as on lettuce adult plants, where strongly affected their metabolism. High production of ROS accompanied by lipid peroxidation, membrane leakage and water status alteration were observed. Interestingly, plants tried to cope with this stress activating metabolic pathways involved in osmotic adjustment and radical scavenging activity. Nevertheless, lettuce plants exposed to VOCs suffered severe damages in the photosynthetic apparatus. In particular, damage to the antenna complex, pigment degradation, reduction of light adapted photosystem II efficiency, reduction of both electron transport rate and nonphotochemical quenching and increment in chlorophyll a fluorescence were caused by VOCs exposure on lettuce plants.  Taken together, these results suggested that plants exposed to D . viscosa VOCs were subjected to a cascade of events involving oxidative stress, photosynthesis machinery and process, water status, to which plant tried to cope by activating defense mechanisms including change in amino acidic metabolism.  In conclusion, D . viscosa is an allelopathic species that can induce net changes in its natural environment affecting nearby plants, and thus contribute to define plant community in the longer term.

To understand the function of membrane proteins, it is imperative to know their topology. For such studies, a split green fluorescent protein (GFP) method is useful. GFP is barrel-shaped, consisting of 11 β-sheets. When the first ten β-sheets (GFP1-10) and the 11th β-sheet (GFP11) are expressed from separate genes they will self-assembly and reconstitute a fluorescent GFP protein. However, this will only occur when the two domains co-localize in the same cellular compartment. We have developed an easy-to-use Gateway vector set for determining on which side of the membrane the N- and C-termini are located. Two vectors were designed for making N- and C-terminal fusions between the membrane proteins-of-interest and GFP11, while another three plasmids were designed to express GFP1-10 in either the cytosol, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen or the apoplast. We tested functionality of the system by applying the vector set for the transmembrane domain, CNX TM , of the ER membrane protein, calnexin, after transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We observed GFP signal from the ER when we reciprocally co-expressed GFP11-CNX TM with GFP1-10-HDEL and CNX TM -GFP with cytosolic GFP1-10. The opposite combinations did not result in GFP signal emission. This test using the calnexin ER-membrane domain demonstrated its C-terminus to be in the cytosol and its N-terminus in the ER lumen. This result confirmed the known topology of calnexin, and we therefore consider this split-GFP system highly useful for ER membrane topology studies. Furthermore, the vector set provided is useful for detecting the topology of proteins on other membranes in the cell, which we confirmed for a plasma membrane syntaxin. The set of five Ti-plasmids are easily and efficiently used for Gateway cloning and transient transformation of N . benthamiana leaves.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543  China Scholarship Council    201206350026   Wenjun Xie       Villum Foundation, Denmark   VKR023502   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8813-0157  Hans Thordal-Christensen     This work was supported by the China Scholarship Council ( http://en.csc.edu.cn/ ) to Wenjun Xie (201206350026) and the Villum Foundation, Denmark ( http://veluxfoundations.dk/en ) (VKR023502).

Several experimental and software-based prediction methods are available for ER as well as other membrane proteins [ 6 – 11 ]. A number of these experimental methods make use of fusing a fluorescent protein to the membrane protein-of-interest. Gross et al. [ 6 ] used reconstitution of split green fluorescent protein (GFP) for topology studies of chloroplastic, mitochondrial and peroxisomal membrane proteins in plant protoplasts. In the present study, we developed an easy-to-use method also using reconstitution of split-GFP for topology studies of membrane proteins in intact plants, as previously described for e.g. ER proteins in a rabbit kidney cell line [ 7 ]. These studies benefit from the work of Cabantous et al. [ 12 ] and Cabantous and Walde [ 13 ], who developed a mutant version of GFP that allowed the first ten β-sheets (GFP1-10) and the eleventh β-sheet (GFP11) to self-assemble and fluoresce when expressed separately.  Here we developed a set of plasmids to facilitate plant membrane protein topology studies. Three plasmids encode soluble GFP1-10 to be expressed either in the cytosol, in the ER lumen or in the apoplast. Another two plasmids were generated as Gateway destination vectors to make N- and C-terminal GFP11 fusions with proteins-of-interest. To subsequently test this membrane protein topology analysis system, we selected to use the transmembrane domain (CNX TM ) of the Arabidopsis ER protein, calnexin 1. Calnexins are ER-membrane integral proteins with an N-terminal Ca 2+ -binding chaperone domain in the ER lumen and a C-terminal transmembrane domain [ 14 , 15 ]. Only when CNX TM -GFP11 was co-expressed with cytosolic GFP1-10 and when GFP11-CNX TM was co-expressed with ER-luminal GFP1-10, did we observe strong GFP signal at the ER cortical network in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells. In the other two combinations, no signal was observed. Similarly, the system was tested using the plasma membrane syntaxin, PEN1 (SYP121) [ 16 , 17 ], and overall our results illustrate the usefulness of this split-GFP system for membrane protein topology analyses in plants.    Materials and Methods   Construct design  A DNA sequence, consisting of a sequence encoding the signal peptide (SP) of the Arabidopsis PR-1 gene (At2g14610), a sequence encoding the modified GFP1-10 [ 13 ] and a coding sequence of the HDEL ER retention signal, all flanked by the Gateway attB1/attB2 recombination cassette, was synthesized by Genscript, NJ, USA. The GFP1-10-HDEL coding sequence was, via recombination into pDONR221 (Invitrogen), subsequently recombined into the T-DNA destination vector, pB2GW7 [ 18 ], for CaMV35S-driven transcription. This generated the pSP-GFP1-10-HDEL Ti-plasmid for expression of ER-luminal GFP1-10 ( S1A Fig ).  Four restriction sites had been introduced in the SP-GFP1-10-HDEL coding sequence. These were two Xho I sites on each side of the ATG start codon and two Hin dIII sites on each side of the HDEL coding sequence. After digesting the SP-GFP1-10-HDEL insert when present in pDONR221 either with Xho I and Hin dIII in combination or with Hin dIII alone, followed by re-ligation, two constructs were obtained. The first encoded only the original GFP1-10 including its ATG start codon, without signal peptide and C-terminal HDEL retention signal. The second construct encoded GFP1-10 with the signal peptide at its N-terminus, but without the HDEL. Recombining these into pB2GW7 using LR clonase reactions generated the pGFP1-10 and pSP-GFP1-10 Ti-plasmids for expression of cytosolic and secreted GFP1-10, respectively ( S1B and S1C Fig ).  Gateway destination vectors for GFP11-protein-of-interest fusions were generated by PCR using pB2GW7, with a protein coding sequence inserted, as template. For the N-terminal GFP11 fusion vector, a combinatorial forward primer (GFP11-M3-3F), consisting of the 3’ part of the CaMV35S promoter, the GFP11 M3 [ 12 ] coding sequence, including a start codon, and the 5’ part of attB1, was designed ( S1 Table ). A reverse primer (P35SR2) was designed from the CaMV35S terminator sequence ( S1 Table ). The amplification product, generated using Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB), was purified and used as megaprimer for amplifying a Ti-plasmid encoding a GFP11 fusion version of the protein in 25 cycles. This plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli after adding the restriction enzyme Dpn I to digest the original template plasmid. A single clone of the plasmid was selected. The Gateway cassette was amplified from pDONR221 using the M13F/M13R primer set, and recombined into the selected plasmid using a BP clonase reaction in order to make the final pGFP11-GW destination T-DNA vector ( S1D Fig ).  In a similar way, we made pGW-GFP11. Here we used a combinatorial reverse primer (GFP11-M3-4R) designed from the 5’ part of the CaMV35S terminator, the GFP11 coding sequence, with a stop codon, attB2 as well as four codons of the inserted coding sequence without stop codon ( S1 Table ). A forward primer (P35SF) was designed from the CaMV35S promoter ( S1 Table ). By using the same procedure as above, we made the final pGW-GFP11 destination T-DNA vector ( S1E Fig ).  The calnexin 1 transmembrane domain (CNX TM )-coding sequence with start codon, and with and without stop codon, was PCR amplified from Arabidopsis Col-0 genomic DNA using gene specific primers ( S1 Table ). The two amplified products were TOPO-cloned into pENTR-D (Invitrogen) and transferred to pK7WGF2 [ 18 ], pGW-GFP11, pGFP11-GW using LR clonase reactions. This generated the pGFP-CNX TM , pGFP11-CNX TM and pCNX TM -GFP11 Ti-plasmids.  The PEN1-coding sequence was PCR-amplified from the GFP-PEN1 coding sequence described by Collins et al. [ 16 ] using gene specific primers with attB1 and attB2 adapter sites ( S1 Table ). The amplified product was re-amplified using attB1 and attB2 primers ( S1 Table ) and cloned into pDONR221 using a BP clonase reaction. To generate a PEN1 coding sequence without stop codon, we performed site-directed mutagenesis by PCR with the PEN1mutSTOP-F and PEN1mutSTOP-R primers, Phusion® and Dpn 1 as described above to convert the stop codon (TGA) to encode Leu (TTA). The two PEN1 constructs were transferred to pGFP11-GW and pGW-GFP11 using LR clonase reactions. This generated the pGFP11-PEN1 and pPEN1-GFP11 Ti-plasmids. All plasmids were produced in E . coli , TOP10 and MACH1, and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens , GV3101, for agroinfiltration.  All generated plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. The CLC software was used for sequence management and for plasmid map design.  The plasmids generated in this work are available upon request.    Agroinfiltration and microscopy  N . benthamiana leaf agroinfiltration and confocal microscopy was performed as previously described [ 19 ]. Specifically, a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope was used. For detection and localization of the fluorophores, GFP was excited at 488 nm and detected between 500 and 530 nm, while RFP was excited at 543 nm and detected between 579 nm and 640 nm.     Results and Discussion  To initially confirm the ER localization of CNX TM , we transiently co-transformed N . benthamiana leaves with the GFP-CNX TM -expression construct and a construct expressing an ER-luminal marker, SP-RFP-HDEL [ 20 ], using agroinfiltration. Confocal microscopic analysis of the epidermal cells 2 days after bacterial infiltration showed overlap between the GFP and the RFP signals. Both signals were cortical network-like as well as perinuclear, but not intranuclear ( Fig 1 ). This signal pattern is indicative of GFP and RFP being at the ER, agreeing with the ER membrane location of CNX TM and the ER-luminal location of RFP-HDEL.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170118.g001  Fig 1   The transmembrane domain of calnexin 1, CNX TM , localizes to the ER membrane.  Constructs encoding GFP-CNX TM and the ER-luminal SP-RFP-HDEL were co-transformed into cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration. Confocal microscopy was performed 2 days after infiltration. Scale bar, 20 μm. Arrow, nucleus.     Next, the CNX TM coding sequence, with and without stop codon, was inserted into the T-DNA Gateway destination vectors, pGFP11-GW and pGW-GFP11, to fuse GFP11 to the N- and C-terminus of CNX TM , respectively. The resulting constructs were co-transformed with constructs expressing either cytosolic GFP1-10 or ER-luminal SP-GFP1-10-HDEL into N . benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration. Two days later, the leaf epidermal cells expressing all four construct-combinations were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Co-expression of GFP11, fused to the C-terminus of CNX TM , with cytosolic GFP1-10, resulted in strong GFP fluorescence at the ER cortical network. Together with a strong perinuclear signal and lack of intranuclear signal ( Fig 2A ), this confirmed the ER localization of CNX TM . The same signal pattern was observed after co-expression of GFP11, fused to the N-terminus of CNX TM , with ER-luminal GFP1-10 ( Fig 2D ). In the other two combinations, no signals were observed ( Fig 2B and 2C ). This showed that GFP11, fused to the cytosolic terminal of an ER membrane protein, was able to self-assemble with free cytosolic GFP1-10 to generate a fluorescent signal. The same was true when these two moieties were co-expressed on the luminal side of the ER membrane, despite the different redox and ionic conditions in this compartment. This was in agreement with previous use of split-GFP in mammalian cells and the known topology of calnexin [ 7 , 15 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0170118.g002  Fig 2   The transmembrane domain of calnexin 1 has its C-terminus in the cytosol and its N-terminus in the ER lumen.  (A-D) Constructs encoding SP-GFP1-10-HDEL, GFP1-10, GFP11-CNX TM and CNX TM -GFP11 were co-transformed pairwise into cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration. Confocal microscopy was performed 2 days after infiltration. Scale bars, 20 μm. Arrows, nuclei.     To explore the usefulness of the method for topology analyses of proteins integral to other membranes, we selected to test the plasma membrane (PM) syntaxin, PEN1 (SYP121) [ 16 , 17 ]. Syntaxins have a single transmembrane domain, their N-terminus in the cytosol and their C-terminus in the lumen of the membrane system or outside the cell, depending on which membrane they are embedded in. As expected, strong GFP fluorescence was observed at the PM after co-expression of PEN1, which has GFP11 fused to its N-terminus, and cytosolic GFP1-10 ( Fig 3A ). When GFP11 was fused to the C-terminus of PEN1, no signal was obtained with cytosolic GFP1-10 ( Fig 3B ). This agreed with the known topology of syntaxins, and showed that the split-GFP system also functions for proteins at other membranes, as previously noted by Gross et al. [ 6 ]. However, when the PEN1-GFP11 construct was co-expressed with the ER-luminal GFP1-10, we observed that the split-GFP-system cannot be used uncritically for protein localization. In this case we observed GFP signal from the ER ( Fig 3D ), and we consider this to be caused by the HDEL ER-retention sequences on GFP1-10. When the PEN1-C-terminally-linked GFP11 β-sheet self-assembled with the ER-retained GFP1-10, we believe PEN1 was returned to the ER from the cis -Golgi by retrograde membrane traffic, resulting in the clear ER-GFP signal. This observation indicates that the GFP11 β-sheet binds to GFP1-10 with a significant strength, and it further supports that the split-GFP-system is useful for membrane topology studies. However, it also provides the important note that the split-GFP system cannot be used for protein localization per se . To overcome this problem of mis-localization, we co-expressed the PEN1-GFP11 construct with a construct for (secreted) SP-GFP1-10. This resulted in GFP signal at the PM ( Fig 3F ) like previously observed when GFP11-PEN1 was combined with cytosolic GFP1-10 ( Fig 3A ). Notably, the PEN1-GFP11/secreted GFP1-10-combination caused a reduced signal, likely due to the lower extracellular pH known to affect the fluorescence of GFP [ 21 ]. Otherwise, when GFP11-PEN1 was co-expressed with ER-luminal or secreted GFP1-10 ( Fig 3C and 3E ), no GFP signal was detected, reflecting that the two GFP moieties never co-exist in a compartment.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170118.g003  Fig 3   The plasma membrane syntaxin, PEN1, has its N-terminus in the cytosol and C-terminal in the apoplast.  (A-F) Constructs encoding GFP1-10, SP-GFP1-10-HDEL, SP-GFP1-10, GFP11-PEN1 and PEN1-GFP11 were co-transformed pairwise into cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration. Confocal microscopy was performed 2 days after infiltration. Scale bars, 20 μm. Arrow, nucleus.     In conclusion, this Gateway system offers an easy-to-use, fast and robust method, useful for uncovering the topology of novel plant proteins found to be membrane-associated. When, as in the case of CNX, a protein has its termini on each side of the membrane, then the method is self-confirmatory in its reciprocality. Meanwhile, it will occur in topology studies that GFP1-10 constructs do not reconstitute with a counterpart to result in fluorescence. To confirm the expression and functionality of such constructs, we recommend combining them with for instance our CNX TM /GFP11 constructs to establish positive controls. A scenario where this would be required is when a membrane protein has its N- and C-termini on the same side of the membrane. Otherwise, it is worth mentioning that GFP11, to be fused onto the protein-of-interest, consists of only 16 amino acids. With this small size, there is minimal risk that it inflicts artefacts influencing the result. An exception will be when the interacting GFP1-10 is limited in its mobility.

Objectives  This study examines the influence of socioeconomic circumstances in childhood (childhood SES) and adulthood (adult SES) on timing of first birth by age 37.    Methods  A longitudinal study of a 1972–1973 New Zealand birth cohort collected information on socioeconomic characteristics from age 3–32 and reproductive histories at 21, 26, 32 and 38; information on first birth was available from 978 of the original 1037. Relative Risks (RR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated using Poisson regression to examine first live birth prior to age 21, from 21–25, from 26–31, and from 32–37, by socioeconomic characteristics at different ages.    Results  Overall, 68.5% of men had fathered a child and 75.9% of women had given birth, by age 37; with overall differences in parenthood to age 31 for men, and 37 for women evident by childhood SES. While parenthood by age 20 was strongly associated with lower childhood SES for both sexes, first entry into motherhood from 32–37 was more likely with higher adult SES at age 32 (RR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–3.0 for medium and RR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.3 for high compared with low). Education also differientated age at parenthood, with those with higher education more likely to defer fatherhood past age 31, and motherhood past age 25 followed by a period of increased likelihood of motherhood for women with higher levels of education from age 32–37 (RR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.87–2.2 and RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6 for medium and high respectively compared with low).    Conclusions  SES varies across the lifecourse, and SES at the time has the strongest association with first births at that time. Low childhood SES drives adolescent parenthood, with resulting cumulative differences in parenthood past age 30. Those with more education and higher adult SES are deferring parenthood but attempt to catch up in the mid to late thirties.

Despite this overall shift towards later childbearing, there is still substantial variation in age at first birth within many countries, that may be influenced by socioeconomic circumstances in both childhood and adulthood [ 3 , 4 ]. A careful understanding of any socioeconomic differentials in age at first birth is important given that early parenthood has been associated with increased disadvantage for children while increasing age is associated with reduced fecundity [ 5 , 6 ].  Surveys and comparisons of aggregate data suggest that variation in age at first birth is more pronounced in countries with ‘liberal’ economies and more limited social policies to support families compared to ‘universalistic’ regimes, with increasing heterogeneity in the former according to socioeconomic circumstances [ 7 – 11 ]. The extent that socioeconomic circumstances truly drive variation in age at first birth is difficult to ascertain, as the use of measures of socioeconomic circumstances from one point in time may result in bias. Causal relationships may be distorted where socioeconomic factors in adulthood are measured at the time of interview, rather than prior to conception, or where data are aggregated at the country level [ 12 – 14 ].  Furthermore, it is unclear whether socioeconomic circumstances influence fatherhood in a similar way, as data for men are limited, and whether socioeconomic circumstances in childhood contribute to these observed patterns. A life-course approach is required that is able to investigate the influence of both childhood and adult socioeconomic circumstances on entry into parenthood for both sexes.  Notably, the term postponement implies eventual entry into parenthood. However, whether postponement is a delay that will be followed by a recuperation phase where individuals go on to become parents, or whether more will remain childless is also less clear [ 15 – 17 ]. Cohort approaches support the idea that there will be some recuperation, however, as many individuals are now delaying parenthood to ages where natural fertility is declining for both men and women, this could result in a greater proportion of the population not being able to become parents or have as many children as they desire [ 17 – 21 ].  The shift to delayed parenthood has occurred within societies that have been characterised as ones where individual fulfilment is paramount, where women’s roles in the labour force have gained increasing importance, and where social norms have become more diverse regarding family structures and sizes and the importance of becoming a parent at all [ 22 – 25 ]. The widespread use of effective contraceptives allows individuals to weigh the personal benefit of having a child amidst competing lifestyle choices [ 1 ]. Economic theorists suggest parenthood is also influenced by costs and ‘opportunity costs’ associated with having children that include the direct expenses of raising children, and lost career opportunities or income [ 26 – 29 ]. These costs may vary by gender and be higher for those with higher socioeconomic status, or for those with higher levels of education, who may also seek to establish careers prior to becoming parents, while enrolment in education may be perceived as incompatible with parenthood [ 1 ]. While higher levels of education have been associated with increased postponement of childbearing overall, the impact of level of education on timing of birth throughout the life-course needs to be examined [ 12 , 13 ]. Associations between low adult socioeconomic status and earlier parenthood have been demonstrated, but they vary among countries [ 8 ].  Socioeconomic circumstances in childhood also influence timing of parenthood, with lower socioeconomic status of the family in childhood associated with adolescent pregnancy and parenthood [ 11 , 30 – 34 ]. This relationship in adolescence is presumed to operate through pathways such as ‘intergenerational transmission’ of social norms for earlier childbearing, or less parental control [ 35 ]. This association with lower socioeconomic status of the family and earlier parenthood appears to persist into the mid-twenties, with suggestions that ongoing differences may be due to differences in education at later ages [ 4 , 33 , 36 – 38 ]. However, the long term impact of childhood socioeconomic status needs to be investigated as there are few representative samples with data for men and women that examine the relationship with parenthood at later ages, or that investigate whether any ongoing differences in adulthood operate primarily through socioeconomic circumstances in childhood or adulthood.  The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study is well positioned to examine these issues as it is a longitudinal study of a birth cohort of men and women, with prospective data on socioeconomic circumstances, and full reproductive histories, collected at several ages to 38 years. Prior analyses of this cohort demonstrated that postponement past age 30 was common, and there was a relationship between early parenthood and low socioeconomic status of the family in childhood [ 5 , 37 – 39 ]. Here we examine the effects of socioeconomic status in childhood and adulthood, and education, on entry into parenthood up to age 38. Our primary aim is to examine the main effects of socioeconomic status and education on first birth at different ages, using socioeconomic measures from each time period that directly precede the births. Furthermore, we aim to assess the long term impact of socioeconomic status in childhood on age at entry into parenthood up to age 38, and to consider the independent effects of childhood and adult socioeconomic status, and of adult socioeconomic status and education.    Materials and Methods   The study  Participants are members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study. The longitudinal cohort consists of all individuals born between April, 1972 and March, 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, who lived in the province and participated in the first follow-up assessment at age 3 (N = 1,037; 52% male) [ 40 ]. Assessments have been carried out at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32 and 38. Ethical approval for Phase (age) 38 of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study was granted by the Lower South Regional Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health (New Zealand) [LRS/10/03/012]. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. At age 21, compared to their age group in the country as a whole, many demographic features were similar, but the sample had a slightly higher level of educational achievement and fewer people of Maori ethnicity [ 41 ].    Reproductive histories  Reproductive histories were sought through a computer-presented questionnaire at ages 21, 26, 32 and 38, and were consistent across assessments. Study members were asked about pregnancies ‘ever’ at 21 and 26, and ‘since the previous assessment’ at 32 and 38, the age at the start of each pregnancy, and the outcome. At the age 38 assessment, study members were asked about desire to have children in the future.  Data from multiple assessments were used to determine the occurrence of a conception leading to a first live birth within four age periods: prior to age 21, from 21–25, from 26–31, and from 32–37. These periods were used to ensure that the outcome of all conceptions at each assessment was known.    Socioeconomic measures  Information on socioeconomic circumstances in childhood (childhood SES) was provided by the parents at the age 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 assessments. Childhood SES was based on parental occupation to the age 15 assessment, averaged across assessments using the highest level of socioeconomic status of either parent at each assessment, using the Elley-Irving scale [ 42 , 43 ]. This is a six-point scale which assigns parents’ self-reported occupational status into one of six categories on the basis of the educational levels and income associated with that occupation using data from the New Zealand census.  Information on personal socioeconomic status in adulthood based on occupation (adult SES) and level of education was collected from study members at 21, 26, and 32. Adult SES at age 21 and 26 was defined using the aforementioned Elley-Irving. Adult SES at age 32 was defined using the New Zealand Socioeconomic Index (NZSEI) [ 44 ]. This replaced the Elley-Irving scale and is similarly constructed using educational level and income to rank occupations.  Level of education was based on highest educational qualification obtained by each assessment, and grouped as ‘low’ (school certificate or less), ‘medium’ (higher school certificate), and ‘high’ (university bursary) at age 21 and as ‘low’ (high-school or less), ‘medium’ (post-secondary, not university), and ‘high’ (university) at ages 26 and 32.    Analysis  Stata version 12.0 SE was used for all analyses. The distribution of the cohort on socioeconomic status at four ages was compared for men and women, and socioeconomic status across these four ages was plotted to assess movement between levels of socioeconomic status over time [ 45 ]. For the first age period (before 21) childhood socioeconomic status of the family was used.  The proportion to report a first birth was given, as well as the distribution by socioeconomic characteristics, for those with no birth by the start of each of the four age periods.  The cumulative incidence of first birth by age 37 was calculated by childhood SES, for each sex. The cumulative incidence of first birth was then calculated for each age period, by each socioeconomic characteristic at the start of the period. Only those who had not had a live birth in the prior age periods were included in the risk set for each age period. Poisson regression was used to estimate the Relative Risks (RR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) with robust standard errors to account for the binary outcome. Separate regressions were fitted for each age period. To assess whether the pattern varied by age, all age periods were included in a single Poisson regression, modelled with robust standard errors. Age period was included as a main effect and in interaction terms, with study members clustered on identification number. The Wald test was used to obtain p-values for interaction. Multivariate models were then constructed which included a) both childhood SES and adult SES, and b) adult SES and level of education.     Results  Of the original cohort of 1037, information on childhood SES was available from 1031, and on adult SES from 977 at the age 21 assessment, 936 at the age 26 assessment, and 971 at the age 32 assessment. Fig 1 displays changes in socioeconomic status for the entire cohort across the life-course. Changes in the pattern represent individual change in socioeconomic status from one period to the next. Notably, the figure shows considerable change from one age period to the next demonstrating the substantial degree of movement for individuals between periods. Comparing whether childhood SES was similar to adult SES at the age 32 assessment showed that only 50.0% of men from families with low status had low adult status at the age 32 assessment, 53.1% from families of medium status had medium status, and even less, 27.3% from families of high status had high status. The respective proportions for women were 50.0%, 57.3%, and 26.9%. Overall, the socioeconomic distributions for the whole cohort were most similar when comparing the measure from childhood and the age 32 assessment.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170170.g001  Fig 1   Changes in Socioeconomic Status (SES) over Time: Individual change (Figure) and distribution of cohort (%) by sex.  The Figure shows individual change in SES at four ages for men and women separately. Above the figure for each time period, the proportion of men and women in the cohort with low, medium, and high SES is also given.     Table 1 gives the number to report a first live birth within each age period, and provides the socioeconomic distribution for the subgroup of the cohort with no first birth at the start of each period. The cumulative incidence of live birth by age 21, 25, 31 and 37 increased from 8.2% by age 20, to 68.5% by age 37 for men and 12.3% to 75.9% for women. Fig 2 displays the cumulative incidence of first live birth by childhood SES. For both men and women, the cumulative incidence of first birth was higher to age 31 for those from families of lower socioeconomic status, with a gradient present. By age 37 this difference by socioeconomic status remained for women but not men. For those with no live birth by the age 38 assessment, 52.9% of men and 46.8% of women reported that they wanted to have a child in the future, 24.6% of men and 22.9% of women were undecided, and 22.5% of men and 30.3% of women did not want to do so ( Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170170.g002  Fig 2   Cumulative Incidence of First Birth by Childhood Socioeconomic Status (SES).      10.1371/journal.pone.0170170.t001  Table 1  Distribution of first births and socioeconomic characteristics in the cohort over four age periods.

Fig 3 shows the proportion to report a first birth in four age periods by socioeconomic status at the start of each period, for those who did not report a first birth in a prior age period (hence at the start of each age period the initial proportion returns to zero). For first birth by age 20, there is a gradient with childhood SES, such that a higher proportion of those with lower socioeconomic status reported a first birth. This was true for both men and women, and more pronounced for women. A higher proportion of those with lower socioeconomic status also reported first births from age 21–25, and from 26–31. However, in the final age period, the pattern reversed and a higher proportion of those from the highest socioeconomic status reported a first birth.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170170.g003  Fig 3   Proportion of men and women with a first live birth in four age periods by socioeconomic status (SES).  Denominator in each period is those with no birth in a prior period. For the first age period childhood SES of the family is used.     Fig 4 considers the relationship with first birth and level of education at the start of each period. A much higher proportion of those with lower levels of education at age 21 reported a first birth by age 20 than for other levels of education, with a gradient present. This association persisted for first birth from age 21–25 for both sexes and from age 26–31 for men. The pattern shifted such that a higher proportion of those with the highest level of education reported a first birth from 32–37, and for women the relative positioning by education had begun to shift from age 26–31.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170170.g004  Fig 4   Proportion of men and women with a first live birth in four age periods by level of education.  Denominator in each period is those with no birth in a prior period.     Table 2 quantifies the relationships in the Figures and confirms that first birth by age 20 in women is strongly predicted by childhood SES, and that the relationship with adult socioeconomic status reverses in the oldest age period. A significantly much lower proportion of women from families of medium (RR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.29–0.81) and high (RR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.16–0.88) socioeconomic status reported a first birth than from families with low socioeconomic status, with a gradient evident. A similar pattern was observed for men, but was not statistically significant: RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.31–1.2 for medium and RR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.09–1.1 for high socioeconomic status compared with low. The strength of this effect weakened across subsequent age periods though the pattern across age periods was not significantly different for women (p-value = 0.2 for interaction) and was of borderline significance for men (p-value = 0.05 for interaction). For adult SES from 32–37 the strong reversal indicated in the figure was confirmed for women, with a much higher proportion of those from medium (RR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–3.0) and high (RR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.3) socioeconomic status reporting a first birth compared with low. For men, the observed pattern was similar, but not statistically significant (RR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.95–2.0 and RR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.99–2.1 respectively). The pattern across age periods was significantly different for women (p-value = 0.005 for interaction), though not for men (p-value = 0.1 for interaction)   10.1371/journal.pone.0170170.t002  Table 2  Relative Risk (RR) of the occurrence of first birth according to socioeconomic factors at the start of each age period.

For first birth by age 20, a much lower proportion of men with a medium (RR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.13–0.60) and high (RR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.02–0.42) level of education reported a first birth compared with a low level. For women, the respective rates were RR = 0.24 (95% CI 0.13–0.44) and RR = 0.37 (95%CI 0.16–0.88). Relative Risks remained lowered for both sexes from 21–26, then weakened for men for first birth from 26–31 and 32–37. For women, there was no evidence of a difference by level of education for first birth from 26–31; however, for first birth from 32–37 the pattern reversed and a higher proportion of women with medium (RR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.87–2.2) and high (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6) levels of education reported a first birth compared with low. The pattern by age period differed significantly for both women (p-value<0.0001 for interaction) and for men (p-value = 0.002 for interaction).  Table 3 assesses the independent effects of childhood SES and adult SES on first birth (Model 1), and then adult SES and level of education (Model 2), using multivariable models that included both factors. Low childhood SES was a strong driver of first birth by age 20, but did not continue to impact first birth in later age periods (Model 1). In contrast, higher adult SES remained strongly associated with higher first birth rates from age 32–37, after adjustment for childhood SES. Including both adult SES and level of education did not substantially alter the findings, indicating that overall these relationships were operating largely independently of one another (Model 2). The exception was that for women from 32–37, the increased relative risk for first birth with higher levels of education was weakened and no longer significantly higher when adult SES was included as a covariate.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170170.t003  Table 3  Multivariate models of the occurrence of first birth within each age period to assess independent effects of a) childhood SES and adult SES at the start of each period (Model 1); and b) adult SES and level of education at the start of each period (Model 2).

Lower socioeconomic status in childhood was strongly associated with adolescent parenthood. While this early effect continued to influence the cumulative incidence of who became a parent to age 31 for men, and to age 37 for women, socioeconomic status in childhood did not have a large influence on entry into parenthood after age 21. Lower adult socioeconomic status was associated with entry into parenthood in younger age periods, but this pattern reversed at older ages. By the mid to late thirties, higher adult socioeconomic status was associated with a greater likelihood of first becoming a parent. Higher levels of education strongly delayed first birth in the early twenties, but again the pattern reversed at older ages. Thus socioeconomic circumstances at each age appeared to act most strongly on first births at that age, but with different effects at different ages. These patterns with socioeconomic circumstances were stronger for women than for men.  Particular strengths of the study include the longitudinal design using a birth cohort with data for both sexes the representativeness of the sample, and the extremely high retention at each assessment. Socioeconomic data were collected prospectively across the life-course, including information on the family of origin collected at several assessments in childhood limiting recall bias. Such data were restricted to events that occurred prior to each interval for first birth, with one exception. As our measure of education for first birth prior to 21 was highest level of qualification at age 21, the much higher likelihood of first birth for those with low levels of education can not be interpreted as causal, and likely reflects in part lower educational level due to childbearing. Otherwise the collection of data on socioeconomic factors and education prior to births enables the causal direction to be established. In this cohort, 24% of women had not a birth by age 37, slightly higher than recent estimates that 19–21% of women aged 35–39 in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States remain childless [ 46 ].  Limitations include the reliance on self-reports at 5 to 6 year intervals, as faulty recall of timing of reproductive events could result in misclassification, as could limitations of men’s knowledge of their partners’ reproductive histories. However, the collection of information on reproductive events at multiple assessments enabled better estimates than those obtained from one period alone. Larger studies are required to confirm findings for men. The scales used to ascertain socioeconomic status changed from the Elley-Irving scale to the NZSEI, which could have resulted in some individuals changing categories between assessments; however both are similarly constructed occupational scales and this could only account for a portion of the differences between measures at age 26 and 32, and not the considerable movement between the other ages.  The substantial movement in individual socioeconomic status over the life-course, as well as from the status of their family in childhood, confirms the importance of using multiple measures preceding first births–as in this study—when considering the impact on entry into parenthood, particularly as having children can result in changes to socioeconomic status. This highlights the limitation of cross sectional studies that measure socioeconomic characteristics only at the time of interview, and thus may give a distorted picture of these relationships.  This study is able to show a long term effect of childhood socioeconomic status on earlier entry into parenthood to age 31 for men and 37 for women. However, it also demonstrates that the observed association at older ages was largely driven by the strong relationship between lower childhood socioeconomic status and who had become a parent by age 21. Past that age, using age specific birth rates in three different age periods, both with and without adjusting for adult socioeconomic status, the effect was weaker and not statistically significant from age 21 to age 31, and was not evident past age 31. Thus, while there may be a role for a shared norm of earlier childbearing for those from families of lower socioeconomic status, perhaps through intergenerational transmission of age at first birth; that this effect does not continue suggests that differences in age of sexual initiation, sexual partnering and contraceptive use may be more important in understanding this early difference (van Roode 2012) [ 39 ].  Low adult socioeconomic status was, as expected, also associated with parenthood before age 26, though our findings were not statistically significant. However, we demonstrated a strong reversal in the direction of the effect for socioeconomic status, with birth rates in the mid to late thirties for women from higher socioeconomic status double those from lower socioeconomic status. The relationship was less marked for men, and we speculate that this reversal may be more evident in the next age period after age 37, because the normative age for parenthood is older for men. Overall the findings are consistent with a later normative age for parenthood, with delayed parenthood past age 31, and an accompanying recuperation period in the mid to late thirties. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that this effect of adult socioeconomic status operated largely independently of childhood socioeconomic status.  Higher educational level was confirmed as a strong deterrent to entry into parenthood for both sexes in the early twenties. As for socioeconomic status, this relationship with education was reversed in the mid to late thirties such that women with higher levels of education had higher birth rates at this age, supporting a later norm for family formation, rather than a forgoing of children altogether. Again, that this relationship was not supported for men, may be because the normative age for men with higher education to enter into parenthood is older than examined here. Consideration of the relative impact of socioeconomic status and education indicates that education is more important in understanding the deferment that occurs in the early twenties, whereas socioeconomic status was more important in driving parenthood in the mid to late thirties. As our early measure of level of education indicated who had a university bursary, the deferment in the early twenties associated with education would support that enrolment in education is not considered compatible with having children [ 1 ].  This longitudinal analysis demonstrates a strong reproductive polarisation in the timing of parenthood, with those experiencing greater disadvantage in society having children at a younger age and those who are more advantaged waiting until they are older. This differential in a cohort born in New Zealand, a country characterised by comparatively limited social policies to assist families, would support the association between such liberal policies and increased heterogeneity in first birth [ 10 , 47 ]. This polarisation is likely to result in greater disadvantage for the next generation of children as the commonality of motherhood becomes age segregated by socioeconomic circumstances. Indeed, previous research suggests there is already widening disparity for children, with those born to young mothers now with greater socioeconomic disadvantage compared to prior generations [ 5 , 48 ]. Thus greater assistance for young disadvantaged families is required to mitigate the effect of this current disparity and to unlink childhood disadvantage from early childbearing.  In contrast, the tendency to delay parenthood into the mid to late thirties for those with higher levels of education and with higher socioeconomic status indicates that current social norms and policies are encouraging many people to delay parenthood to an age where natural fertility is declining. While there is some recuperation in the mid to late thirties, our findings indicate that many men and women still wished to have a child or more children in the future. As fertility declines with age, and fertility treatments are less successful at older ages, this may result in a substantial proportion who will not be able to become parents or not have as many children as they desire [ 21 ]. Government policies that facilitate parenthood during more optimal reproductive years may be helpful in addressing these issues [ 49 , 50 ].  Future research on this cohort has been planned to investigate how socioeconomic characteristics influence total number of children at the end of the reproductive span, and the proportions who remain voluntarily and involuntarily childless. Proximate factors associated with timing of parenthood, especially patterns of sexual partnering, have already been examined in this cohort [ 39 ]. They are likely to mediate some of the relationships observed. Linking SES measures to such proximate factors is beyond the scope of this paper but could be undertaken to investigate specific hypotheses in the future. Furthermore, other characteristics of the family of origin such as the age of the individual’s mother at her first birth could further inform about what drives these observed fertility patterns.

The endocrine disruptor bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has been shown to exert adverse effects on the male animal reproductive system. However, its mode of action is unclear and a systematic analysis of its molecular targets is needed. In the present study, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP during a critical period for gonads differentiation to testes on male mice offspring reproductive parameters, including the genome-wide RNA expression and associated promoter methylation status in the sperm of the first filial generation. It was observed that adult male offspring displayed symptoms similar to the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome. A combination of sperm transcriptome and methylome data analysis allowed to detect a long-lasting DEHP-induced and robust promoter methylation-associated silencing of almost the entire cluster of the seminal vesicle secretory proteins and antigen genes, which are known to play a fundamental role in sperm physiology. It also resulted in the detection of a DEHP-induced promoter demethylation associated with an up-regulation of three genes apparently not relevant for sperm physiology and partially related to the immune system. As previously reported, DEHP induced an increase in mir-615 microRNA expression and a genome-wide decrease in microRNA promoter methylation. A functional analysis revealed DEHP-induced enrichments in down-regulated gene transcripts coding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways, and in up-regulated gene transcripts coding for calcium binding and numerous myosin proteins. All these enriched pathways and networks have been described to be associated in some way with the reproductive system. This study identifies a large new array of genes dysregulated by DEHP that may play a role in the complex system controlling the development of the male reproductive system.

Data Availability  Both MBDseq and RNAseq data are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus of the National Center for Biotechnology Information under the links provided: MBDseq: [ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67159 ] & RNAseq [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86837 ].    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0170441.g005   Introduction  The adverse impact of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on the animal reproductive system has been documented since the 1980s. In mice, DEHP was found to induce phenotypic alterations partially analogous to the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) [ 1 ]. The increasing incidence of TDS was reported to be due to adverse environmental influences, but the exact mechanisms causing the disorder have still to be elucidated [ 2 , 3 ]. At present, the disorder is thought to originate during fetal growth and to be associated with an alteration in testosterone production. Due to the impossibility to study the mechanisms that give rise to TDS in the human fetus, animals exposed in utero to phthalate are used as a mimicking model system [ 3 ].  In humans, evidence suggests that DEHP alters testosterone production and/or distribution, both essential for testes development. In a study using human testes cells in culture, DEHP 10 −5 or 10 −4 M or mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the major DEHP metabolite, were found to inhibit testosterone production [ 4 ]. A large multicenter study showed a statistically significant association between blood levels of the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and urinary concentrations of MEHP [ 5 ]. The crystal structure of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was found to bind to SHBG via a steroid binding pocket. Interestingly, fit docking simulations predicted that DEHP would bind with a higher affinity to the SHBG steroid pocket than DHT [ 6 ]. When occurring in a critical testis development period, competition between DEHP and DHT to bind to SHBG might induce a decrease in testosterone production, which may explain DEHP-induced TDS.  DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the expression of non-coding regulatory RNAs are well-known epigenetic mechanisms responsible for the diversification of various cell types during development and for the maintenance of diverse genomic expression profiles throughout life. “The primordial germ cells, embryo, and fetus are highly susceptible to epigenetic dysregulation by environmental chemicals, which can thereby exert multiple adverse effects” [ 7 ]. Previously, we identified promoter methylation changes in sperm DNA associated with decreased spermatogenesis in C57BL/6J susceptible mice prenatally exposed to DEHP [ 8 ].  DEHP exposure after complete testis development is also deleterious for reproductive functions. When testes and ovaries from 7 to 12-weeks-old human fetuses were exposed to 10 −4 M MEHP during 72 h, an increased apoptosis was observed in male gonads. In addition, an increased expression of LXRα and its downstream genes involved in lipid and cholesterol synthesis was observed in both male and female gonads [ 9 ]. Treatment of Big Blue ® transgenic mice with DEHP for 4 weeks induced a 3-fold increase in genomic DNA mutation frequency [ 10 ]. Furthermore, a 96 h exposure to 10 μM MEHP of cultured chicken postnatal testis cells altered seminiferous tubule differentiation [ 11 ]. Similarly, a 30 min exposure to 1 μg/ml DEHP of mouse spermatozoa reduced their fertilization ability and the resultant embryo developmental potential [ 10 ]. These results strongly suggest that DEHP exposure has a direct negative impact on spermatozoa, independent of the alteration of testosterone production in testis.  The testis differentiation period seems to be the most critical time window to investigate the negative impact of DEHP on reproductive functions in males and to mimick human TDS, which occurs during fetal life and is associated with the abnormal development of testosterone-producing Leydig and supporting Sertoli cells. In mice embryos, somatic gonadal precursors composed of post-migrating primordial germ cells started the dynamic sexual differentiation to produce fetal testis with Sertoli, Leydig and pro-spermatogonial cells at embryonic day 10 (E10.5). This process is triggered by the “sex-determining region of Y chromosome” and involves the activation of testosterone-dependent genes [ 12 , 13 ]. A previous investigation of TDS mechanisms showed that prenatal exposure to 500 mg/kg dibutyl phthalate during embryonic days 13 to 21 in Wister rats resulted in a significant reduction in plasma testosterone at day 25. A 90% reduction of testosterone levels was measured in testes at embryonic day 19, as well as the detection of Leydig cell hyperplasia, a dysgenic area, and the presence of immature Sertoli cells in testes [ 3 ].  We investigated the effects of DEHP administered to pregnant mice between days E9 and E19 (i.e. during the period that is considered as critical for testis differentiation) on the reproductive function in vivo and the genome-wide RNA expression and promoter methylation in the sperm of male offspring. We used also a new method that was able to quantify any type of RNA molecules at the genome-wide level, independent of their 5’ and 3’ modifications.    Materials and Methods   Mice mating and DEHP exposure  Animals were housed in plastic cages with food (RM3, SDS Dietex, France) and water provided ad libitum and maintained on a 12:12 light cycle. The zero filial generation (F0) consisted of 10 to 12-weeks-old male and female mice pairs of strain C57BL/6J (Charles River, l’Arbresle, France). Mice were mated in a cage during the night before selection and examined for the presence of a plug indicating copulation the following day, which was defined as embryonic day 1 (E1) by referring to future pups. F0 males were removed from the cage at E1. Prenatal exposure was performed by per os administration once daily from E9 to E19 to pregnant female mice restrained in one hand by grasping the scruff of the neck of 20 μl of either corn oil (Sigma, C8267) for controls (CTL) or 20 μl of 1.15 M DEHP (Fluka-Sigma, DEHP Selectophore, Catalog no. 80030) diluted in corn oil for exposed mice. The dose calculated for an estimated mouse weight of 30 g corresponded to 300 mg of DEHP per kg of mice per day (mg/kg*bw/day) (D300). The first filial generation of mice (F1) consisted of pups born at E21, weaned at postnatal day 21 (P21), and used for both computer-assisted sperm analyses (CASA) and RNA-seq experiments 100 days after birth (P100). Of note, a double dose of 20 μl of 2.3 M DEHP in corn oil, corresponding to 600 mg/kg*bw/day (D600) of DEHP, was additionally used in experiments recording litter sizes.    Anogenital distance measurements  The anogenital distance (AGD) was expressed in centimeters and corresponded to the distance separating both anal and genital orifices. It was measured by two investigators in F1 live males using a graduated ruler.    CASA and sampling  Five CTL male and five D300 male F1 offspring of the treated females were sacrificed 100 days after birth by C0 2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Left and right testes were dissected from the animal bodies and weighed. One was fixed in Bouin solution and the other in 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate-buffered saline solution. The left and right cauda epididymides of each animal were incised with a scalpel in 1 ml M2 medium and maintained at 37°C during 10 min. Diluted sperm suspensions were loaded into a 37°C pre-warmed chamber slide of 100 μm depth. The slide was observed in a phase contrast microscope. Sperm fertility parameters were measured using the CEROS II CASA system (Hamilton Thorne Research, Beverly, MA) and data were analyzed using the CASAnova software. Five microscopy fields were analyzed in each experiment and amounted to at least 700 spermatozoa per sample. The CASA recorded the following parameters: 1) the sperm concentration expressed in millions of spermatozoa per ml; 2) the percentage of motile spermatozoa; 3) the curvilinear velocity in μm/s; and 4) the amplitude of lateral head displacement in μm/s.    Testes histology  Ten different testes (five per condition) were fixed in Bouin, embedded in paraffin, sliced with a microtome, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and analyzed under a microscope at four different magnifications. A total of 483 seminiferous tubule diameters and 483 corresponding lumen diameters were measured in μm at 5X magnifications (48 ± 12 tubules measured per sample). Classification of seminiferous tubules according to the spermatid presence in lumens were performed at 10X magnifications for five CTL F1 and five D300 F1 samples, resulting in a total of 141 tubules segregated as “negative”, “closed”, “positive” and “full”. “Negative” tubules contained lumen with an apparent absence of elongated spermatids. “Closed” tubules corresponded to tubules without lumen. “Positive” tubules contained lumen with small numbers of spermatid. “Full” tubules contained lumen massively colonized by flagella of elongating spermatids.    RNA extraction from spermatozoa  For each mouse, 900 μl of sperm suspension not used for CASA were carefully obtained by pipette in order to avoid scratched left and right cauda epididymis tissues and centrifuged at 17,000 g during 30 sec before replacement of the liquid phase with 1 ml of the TRIzol ® Reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX). The purity of spermatozoa used to extract RNA was assessed before the procedure by visualizing sperm under a contrast phase microscope during the CASA process and after RNA sequencing with read length distributions corresponding to the profile of mature sperm RNA signatures as previously determined [ 14 ]. RNA extraction was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and included the addition of 10 μg RNase-free glycogen as carrier (Invitrogen, UltraPure ™ Glycogen, Carlsbad, CA) during RNA precipitation in isopropanol. The final elution was in 20 μl water (Bioconcept, Water for Molecular Biology DNA/DNAse/RNAse free) and samples were frozen in dry ice and conserved at -80°C in labelled Eppendorf tubes.    RNA-derived libraries construction  In general, messenger RNAs contain 3’-poly-A tails and a 5’-cap, but most mature microRNAs differ with a 5'-monophosphate extremity and a free 3’-hydroxyl group resulting from their maturation by Dicer cleavage. RNA samples were sent to Fasteris SA (Geneva, Switzerland) in dry ice. RNA quality was verified with the Bioanalyzer 2100 Expert or the Caliper GX-LST LabChip ® systems (Caliper Life Sciences, Massachusetts, USA). First, ribosomal RNAs were depleted using the Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA; MRZH116 or MRZG12324). Second, rRNA-depleted RNA was fragmented to sizes in the range of 60–200 nt using a fragmentation reagent (Ambion; AM8740). Third, RNA molecules were treated to be compatible with adapter ligation following a protocol developed by Fasteris SA: i) RNA molecules naturally carrying various pyrophosphate bonds and 5'-cap structures were converted in RNA carrying a 5'-monophosphate group using Cap-Clip ™ acid pyrophosphatase treatment; ii) 5’-monophosphate-RNAs were treated with phosphatase-producing RNAs without any phosphate group in 5' and 3'; iii) the phosphate group free RNA molecules were treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase-producing 5’-monophosphate RNA molecules. Even if deriving from mRNA and microRNA, the resulting molecules should carry a 5'-monophosphate extremity and a free 3’-hydroxyl group. Libraries were then prepared using the TruSeq small RNA kit (Illumina Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions and involving the RNA 3’ adapter (RA3) 5’-TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG and RNA 5’ adapter (RA5) 5’-GUUCAGAGUUCUACAGUCCGACGAUC .    Sequencing and base calling  Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina Inc.). Base calling was performed using HiSeq Control Software 2.2.58, RTA 1.18.64.0 and CASAVA-1.8.2. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus [ 15 ] and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE86837 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86837 ).    RNA-seq analysis  Fastq files were uploaded and the analysis was performed in-house in a Linux environment (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) containing the installed bioinformatic tools required. Quality control of the sequencing process was performed with fastqc ensuring >Q28 in the quality control report for all reads. RA3 was clipped from fastq files and the minimum reads size was settled at 18 pb using the command line: $ fastx_clipper -a TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG -l 18 -i /data/PATH/original.fastq -o /data/PATH/C57_CTL_F1_1.fastq. The analysis was performed using TopHat and Cuffdiff [ 16 ]. Reads were mapped for each sample using TopHat to the mm10 mouse genome with the following command line: $ tophat -p 16 -G /data/PATH/genes.gtf—library-type fr-secondstrand -o /data/PATH /C57_CTL_F1_1 /data/PATH/genome /data/PATH/C57_CTL_F1_1.fastq. SAM files were indexed and sorted: $ samtools sort accepted_hits.bam C57.CTL.F1.1.sorted. $ samtools index C57.CTL.F1.1.sorted.bam. Quantification was performed with the following command line: $ cuffdiff -o /data/PATH/diff_out -b /data/PATH/genome.fa -p 16 -L CTL,D300 -u /data/genome/mm10_new/Mus_musculus/UCSC/mm10/Annotation/Genes/genes.gtf /data/PATH/C57.CTL.F1.1.sorted.bam,/data/PATH/C57.CTL.F1.2.sorted.bam,/data/PATH/C57.CTL.F1.3.sorted.bam,/data/PATH/C57.CTL.F1.4.sorted.bam,/data/PATH/C57.CTL.F1.5.sorted.bam, /data/PATH/C57.D300.F1.1.sorted.bam,/data/PATH/C57.D300.F1.2.sorted.bam,/data/PATH/C57.D300.F1.3.sorted.bam,/data/PATH/C57.D300.F1.4.sorted.bam,/data/PATH/C57.D300.F1.5.sorted.bam. The reads log table was built to control and resume processes performed from fastq to bam files ( Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170441.t001  Table 1  Read log sheet of RNA-seq experiments.

Separate enrichment analysis of pathways for up- and down-regulated genes were performed to identify enrichments and networks of interacting genes based on “a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions”, including “direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations” identified by the STRING database and using the most stringent parameters [ 17 ]. The analysis was performed online ( http://string-db.org/ ) with the two lists of official gene symbols and selecting the “ Mus musculus ” organism. The minimum required interaction score was set at the highest confidence level (0.9) and only networks involving more than two genes were taken in account. Otherwise, dashed lines display interactions that do not resist the highest confidence level. Separate enrichment analysis of pathways for up- and down-regulated genes was preferred. According to a previous report, this approach is more powerful than analyzing all of the differentially expressed genes together and results in the identification of “more pathways that are really pertinent to phenotyping differences” [ 18 ].    Combined promoter methylation and RNA expression analysis  The RNA-seq database was merged by gene symbol in the R free software environment (Project for Statistical Computing; https://www.r-project.org/ ) with our previously published and open access methyl-CpG binding (MBD)-seq database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67159 ) used under similar conditions for strain C57BL/6J with CTL and DEHP300 subjects [ 8 ]. Regression analysis was performed using the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) method to estimate the trend between RNA expression and promoter methylation. Gene selection for combined MBD-seq and RNA-seq analyses was done in two steps. First, statistically significant differentially-expressed genes in CuffDiff output associated with the lowest and the highest fold changes were selected as the top-up and top-down targets. Second, the nine most closely expressed genes for both targets were then fished using the Jensen-Shannon distance estimate. For statistical differences in the measurement of fragments per kilobase of transcripts per million fragments mapped (FPKM) between both conditions, i.e. p values derived from the non-parametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test performed among five CTL and five D300 mice, the means and 95% confidence interval were calculated, independent of the nature of the measurement distribution.    Statistical analysis  A non-parametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test was performed when measurements of reproductive parameters did not follow a normal distribution; Student's t -tests were performed for parameters following a normal distribution. Pearson's chi-squared test (χ2) was performed in R using the “chisq.test” function on seminiferous tubule segregation results obtained for both F1 CTL and F1 D300 conditions. Basic statistical analysis of the validity of the differential analyses from quintuplicate sperm-extracted RNA samples between both CTL and D300 conditions was performed using CummeRbund version 2.14.0. Data quality was estimated both at the post-sequencing step and before differential analysis. Differential analysis of RNA was performed at the genome level without a priori. The global densities of FPKM measurements across genes were verified to be similar between both conditions and across the 10 samples at the genome scale (data not shown). Statistical significant differences in FPKM measurements between CTL and D300 conditions were taken in account after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing implemented within CuffDiff.

Results   Testis dysgenesis and affected reproductive parameters after prenatal exposure to DEHP  A possible impact of prenatal DEHP exposure on the litter sizes of offspring was tested. The litter sizes of F1-treated mothers (F1 D300) decreased compared with control mothers (F1 CTL), but this effect was significant only for 600 mg/kg/day (F1 D600), which was the highest dose tested (t-test; p = 0.03) ( Fig 1B ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170441.g001  Fig 1   Testis dysgenesis and decreased reproductive parameters after prenatal exposure to DEHP.

VCL: Curvilinear velocity. ALH: amplitude of lateral head displacement. Df: degree of freedom. N: total number of tubules segregated.     The impact of fetal DEHP exposure on male reproductive parameters was investigated in F1 males born from mice receiving either 20 μl corn oil vehicle (CTL) or 300 mg/kg/day DEHP diluted in corn oil (D300) per os each day from E9 to E19. CASA was performed on sperm extracted from the cauda epididymis ( Fig 1A ) dissected at 100 days in C57BL/6J males (P100). Compared with CTL subjects, all reproductive parameters measured were significantly decreased in the F1 offspring of mice prenatally exposed to DEHP. AGD and testes weight were significantly reduced in the D300 group compared to CTL mice, (1.9 cm ± 0.16 in CTL vs. 1.5 cm ± 0.06 cm in D300 [p = 1,2*10 −3 ] and 214 mg ± 14 in CTL vs. 193 mg ± 15 in D300 [p = 0.049], respectively) ( Fig 1C & 1D ). Histological observation of the testes showed a reduction of the germinal tissue thickness inside the seminiferous tubules in D300 compared to CTL mice ( Fig 1E ). This apparent reduction was quantified by measuring the diameters of the tubules, but was not significant (192 μm ± 38in CTL vs. 193 μm ± 39 in D300; p = 0.76) ( Fig 1F ). Of note, the diameters of the lumens significantly increased in D300 compared with CTL mice (64 μm ± 28 in CTL vs. 86 μm ± 29 in D300; p = 3.66*10 −16 ) ( Fig 1G ). The ratio of seminiferous tubules diameters over corresponding lumen diameters was reduced under D300 conditions (3.6 μm ± 1.9 in CTL vs. 2.5 μm ± 0.97 in D300; p = 1.4*10 −15 ) ( Fig 1H ). Although the rate of seminiferous tubules with spermatids did not differ between CTL and D300 mice, seminiferous tubules with lumens massively colonized by flagella of elongating spermatids (“full”) were decreased in D300 compared with CTL mice and associated with a Chi-square-based significant difference of tubular segregation results ( Fig 1I ).  In the D300 group, the sperm concentration measured with CASA was almost half of that observed in the CTL mice (101 million per ml ± 56 in CTL vs. 56 ± 6 millions per ml in D300; Wilcox p-value = 7,9*10 −3 ). The minimal CTL value (73 millions) remained higher than the maximal D300 value (64 millions) ( Fig 1J ). All motility-related parameters were reduced in D300 compared to CTL mice as follows. Motility: 27.4% ± 6.8 motile spermatozoa in CTL vs. 11.8% ±7 in D300; p = 7.21*10 −3 ); curvilinear velocity: 125 ± 5 μm/s in CTL vs. 85 ± 8 μm/s in D300; p = 1.4*10 −4 ); and amplitude of lateral head displacement: 7.4 μm/s ± 0.3 in CTL vs. 5 μm/s ± 1 in D300; p<0.007), ( Fig 1K, 1L & 1M ).  Overall, the prenatal exposure of C57BL/6J mice to 300 mg/kg/day of DEHP resulted in decreases in AGD, sperm concentration and motility and in seminiferous tubules’ germinal thickness, as well as in the proportion of “full” tubule, i.e. a phenotype consistent with a TDS.    Sperm RNA expression changes after prenatal exposure to DEHP  We postulated that the defects observed in both the concentration and the motility of spermatozoa in D300 mice may be caused by alteration in gene expression involved in sperm survival and motility. To test this hypothesis, RNAs extracted from spermatozoa sampled from the cauda epididymidis were quantified with the modified RNA-seq process in quintuplicates in both CTL and D300 mice. Results showed that 283 genes were significantly differentially present or expressed. One hundred and seventy-three (61%) were down-regulated, whereas 110 (39%) were up-regulated in D300 compared to CTL mice ( Fig 2 ). These genes were enriched in several pathways discussed later. Note that some genes measured previously by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used as controls ( S1 Fig ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170441.g002  Fig 2   Sperm RNA expression changes after prenatal exposure to DEHP.  Clustering and heat map analysis performed on the 283 genes that were significantly differentially present or expressed in sperm of controls (CTL) and DEHP exposed mice (D300). Data correspond to 10 RNA-seq experiments analyzed with TopHat-Cuffdiff pipeline [ 16 ]. Measurements were obtained in the five D300 individual samples clustering together on the left and five CTL individual samples clustering on the right of the heat map. The 173 genes down-regulated in D300 mice are presented under their official gene symbols in red; the 110 genes up-regulated in D300 mice are presented under their official gene symbols in green. The genes identified in a network are presented in bold.       Pathways in which mRNA expression is up- or down-regulated after prenatal exposure to DEHP  The genome-wide RNA quantification study was followed by pathway analysis to identify putative pathways dysregulated in D300 vs. CTL mice. Up- and down- regulated genes were separately submitted to online functional analysis using STRING [ 17 ], resulting in both the characterization of interacting networks of dysregulated genes and significant enrichments in functional pathways.  In the 173 sperm down-regulated genes, significant enrichments of both the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways were observed ( Fig 3A ). In addition, the functional analysis revealed the enrichment of two interacting gene networks, i.e. the oncogene network and the chemokine network. Interestingly, both networks shared members of both signaling pathways. As DEHP interferes with mammalian hormones, the possible involvement of genes associated with hormone metabolism was also investigated. Mt2, Cyp4a10 and Ptgs2 genes in the oncogene network have been previously involved in the metabolism of glucocorticoids, steroids, and prostaglandins, respectively ( Fig 3A ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170441.g003  Fig 3   Dysregulated pathways in sperm after prenatal exposure to DEHP.  (A) Members of cluster 1 (shown as blue line and blue gene symbols) correspond to 173 genes significantly down-regulated in D300 compared to CTL mice. Cluster 1 is significantly enriched for the TNF (FDR = 4*10 −3 ) (pink circles) and PPAR signaling pathways (FDR = 2*10 −2 ) (yellow circles). Two networks of interacting genes can be identified that share members of both the TNF and PPAR signaling pathways. First, the oncogene network displays 12 genes among which Fos, Jun, Jumb and Ptgs2 belong to the TNF pathway and Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a14 to the PPAR pathway. Second, the chemokine network displays seven genes among which Cxcl2 and Cxcl1 belongs to the TNF pathway. Hormones and prostaglandins (in red) interact with members of the oncogene network (black arrows). Glucocorticoid hormone-induced Mt2 expression and hormone-like prostaglandins are synthesized by prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) and steroid oxidation is catalyzed by both cytochromes Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a14 (see results section). (B) Cluster 2 (in brown) is composed of 110 genes significantly up-regulated in D300 mice and is highly significantly enriched in calcium ion binding proteins (FDR = 1.1*10 −6 ). Three networks of genes were identified: the myosin network (nine members), the interferon network (five members), and the receptor network (four members). Calcium ion binding proteins belonging to the myosin network are Actn2, Myl1, Mylpf, Tnnc2 and Myl3 (green circles). The interferon network involves the tumor suppressor Sp100 and both antimicrobial peptides related to Gbp2b and Gbp2 and a HLA class 2 member, all sharing a common immune response. The receptor network involves coding receptors of three genes: the galanin receptor (Galr1), the C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (Ccr2), and the alpha-2B adrenergic receptor (Adra2b), although the last chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (Cxcl13) is not a receptor.     In the 110 sperm up-regulated genes, significant enrichments of calcium-binding proteins (false discovery rate (FDR) = 1.1*10 −6 )) were observed, as well as in three networks of interacting genes, i.e. the myosin network, interferon network, and receptor network, apparently disconnected from each other ( Fig 3B ). The myosin network contains calcium-binding proteins associated with myosin interacting genes and consists of numerous genes encoding myosin constituents, such as the myosin light polypeptides (Myl1, Myl3), heavy polypeptides (Myh1, Myh2), light chain (Mylpf), light polypeptide kinase (Mylk2, Mylk4, not in the network), myosin-binding protein (Mybcpc2), and obscurin (Obscn, not in the network), the last putative gene involved in the assembly of myosin ( Fig 3B ). Genes involved in the metabolism of hormones were not clearly identifiable in the networks.    Associations of RNA expression and promoter methylation changes after prenatal exposure to DEHP  In mice prenatally exposed to DEHP, experimental evidence suggests an alteration of spermatogenesis. The latter involves the dynamic expression and epigenetic changes of genes across various developmental stages ranging from spermatogonium to mature elongated spermatids, as well as interactions between different cell subtypes. Genes whose RNA expression was highly dysregulated by prenatal exposure to DEHP associated with promoter methylation changes were analyzed in mature sperm and then confronted to normal spermatogenesis-related expression profiles to investigate if these targets were associated with a particular spermatogenesis step.  Dysregulation of sperm RNA expression in D300 mice may be caused by the methylation of CpG in promoters, which are able to block transcriptional activity by rendering DNA inaccessible to transcription factors. In order to test if prenatal exposure to DEHP could mediate a long-lasting promoter methylation gene silencing in the sperm, RNA-seq was merged with accessible MBD-seq data ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67159 ) that consists of sequencing methylated DNA after its capture by affinity using the MBD domain. Both datasets were obtained under similar conditions and compared CTL and D300 C57BL/6J mice [ 8 ].  Decreased RNA expression with increased promoter methylation was observed in the entire dataset for both CTL and D300 mice (data not shown). We analyzed the most dramatically dysregulated genes in terms of fold changes in RNA expression using Jensen-Shannon distance estimates. Genes whose FPKM status was exactly equal to zero in one condition (CTL or D300) were removed for mathematical reasons ( Fig 4 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170441.g004  Fig 4   Sperm-selected genes with RNA expression and promoter methylation changes after prenatal exposure to DEHP.  (A,B,C,D,E,F) Promoter methylation analysis in the most dysregulated genes in terms of fold changes between CTL and D300 conditions combined with assessment of the transcriptional levels across spermatogenesis-related cells and tissues. (A, B) When compared with CTL conditions, most down- and up-regulated genes in the D300 group fished by Jensen-Shannon distance estimates performed with the topmost down and significant Sva and the topmost up and significant Rbp2 genes (shown in bold).

Among the 10 top down-regulated genes in the sperm of DEHP exposed mice, six of the eight known members of genes encoding seminal vesicle secretory proteins or antigens were identified: Svs2 , Svs3a , Svs3b , Svs4 , Svs6 , Pate4 , and Sva ( Fig 4C ). In four ( Svs2 , Svs3b , Svs4 , Sva ), a statistically significant decrease in mRNA expression associated with a statistically significant increase in promoter methylation in DEHP exposed mice was observed ( Fig 4C & 4D ). These genes are highly expressed in spermatogenesis-related tissues and sperm cells, in particular, the Svs4 expression level increases with sperm cell maturation [ 19 ] ( Fig 4A ). Svs2 was highly expressed according to the lacZ reporter (Svs2 tm1.1(KOMP)Vlcg ) in seminal vesicle, prostate, epididymidis and ductus deferens ( http://www.informatics.jax.org/assay/MGI:5771180 ) [ 20 ].  Nine of the 10 top up-regulated genes identified by Jensen-Shannon distance estimates ( Gm6329 , Gm8994 , Gzmk , C1qntf5 , Fbxw15 , mir615 , Rbp2 , 231002L09Rik and 1700044K03Rik ) reached statistical significance ( Fig 4E ). Three ( Gzmk , Ctqtnf5 and 1700044K03Rik ) resulted in statistically significantly increased mRNA expression associated with decreased promoter methylation in the sperm of DEHP exposed mice ( Fig 4E & 4F ). Gzmk , Rbp2 and 230002L09Rik are transcripts in spermatogenesis-related tissues and sperm cells ( Fig 4B ), but there are no data concerning the tissue-specific mRNA expression in the remaining 10 top up-regulated genes [ 19 ]. It is noteworthy that among these 10 top up-regulated genes, one microRNA (mir615) was detected by Jensen-Shannon distance estimates. Promoter methylation of mir-615 was absent in the MBD-seq database.    Expression and methylation changes in gene subtypes after prenatal exposure to DEHP  The profile of expression and promoter methylation across different type of RNAs was investigated to characterize to what extent both RNA-seq and MBD-seq data were in agreement, to test if the functionally related genes were altered at the gene group level, and to investigate the global behavior of the microRNAs. Genes were grouped in the following subtypes. The first group consisted of 67 detected C/D box small nucleolar RNAs ( Snord) . The second group ( Svs ) was composed of the nine seminal vesicle secretory genes ( Sva , Svs1 , Svs2 , Svs3a , Svs3b , Svs4 , Svs5 , Svs6 , and Pate4 ). All microRNAs were grouped together in a “mir” group (n = 986). The last group (“up”) consisted of the nine top genes detected as up-regulated in the sperm of DEHP exposed mice ( Rbp2 , mir615 , C1qtnf5 , Gzmk , Gm8994 , Gm6329 , Fbxw15 , 231002L09Rik and 1700044K03Rik ). Results showed that both Snord and Svs were the two most highly expressed RNA subtypes in the sperm of CTL mice associated with less methylation in promoters, whereas microRNAs and the “up” gene groups were the two less highly expressed RNA subtypes in the sperm of CTL mice associated with more methylation in promoters ( Fig 5A, 5B & 5C ). These results are in accordance with the model of promoter methylation-mediated repression of gene expression. At the gene group levels, statistically significant differences were observed in the sperm of DEHP exposed mice compared to CTLs regarding expression in the Svs (decrease: Wilcox p-value = 4.1*10 −5 ) and “up” (increase: Wilcox p-value = 2.8*10 −3 ) groups, whereas significant promoter methylation differences were detected in the Svs (increased: p = 0.04) and microRNA (decrease: p< 2*10 −16 ) groups ( Table 2 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170441.t002  Table 2  Statistics of transcripts and promoter methylation levels in sperm RNA subtypes.

Stars represent significant differences between CTL and D300 groups (results are shown in Table 2 ). (D) Reads mapped to the cluster of Svs genes in chromosome 2 across the 10 samples. Five CTL samples up and five D300 down from the horizontal dashed line. Reads in blue and red differ according to their orientation; genes orientations are shown with arrows.     Despite the highly significant decrease observed in microRNA promoter methylation, the expression of microRNA analysis did not show any statistical difference. High variability and numerous cases of microRNAs showing 0 FPKM in one condition was observed. The difference in expression of the six Svs genes clustered in the mouse chromosome 2 was verified at the reads mapping level. Results showed visible difference of reads coverage between D300 and CTL mice, as well as a correct orientation of the mapped reads according to the gene orientations ( Fig 5D ).     Discussion  We showed that prenatal exposure to DEHP in C57BL/6J mice resulted in statistically significant lower litter sizes at the highest dose tested, compatible with decreased embryo survival. F1 males were bred up to mature adulthood at P100 and five F1 D300 were compared to five CTL subjects. Results demonstrated a reduced AGD, lighter testes, severe decreased sperm quality, atrophy of the germinal tissue thickness, and a lower amount of seminiferous tubules with lumens full of elongated spermatids ( Fig 1 ). These observations converge to an acquired hypogonadism at adulthood and a phthalate-induced phenotype resembling human TDS. The reduction of fertility in males prenatally exposed to DEHP remains to be further analyzed by detailed recordings of litter sizes, plug productions and pregnancy efficiency in the second filial generation (F2). F2 mice should be obtained by crossing F1 D300 and F1 CTL males with new females, thus producing comparable F2 litters. In addition, testosterone supplementation experiments are strongly needed. In the absence of both results, the impact on fertility and interferences with testosterone remains speculative in the present study.  The observed phenotype is in accordance with previous work reporting on prenatal exposure to phthalates inducing TDS in rodents [ 1 ]. Even if highly speculative, we believe that the observed DEHP-induced TDS may be caused by the impaired distribution of androgen produced by Leydig cells during the critical period for embryonic testis differentiation with a potential effect on reproductive performance. Recently, an in silico approach revealed that the DEHP molecule may compete with DHT and/or testosterone for SHBG [ 6 ]. AGD is a biomarker of androgen exposure during the fetal testis development period in rodents as well as in humans [ 21 ], whereas sperm concentration and motility are the most significant predictor of human fertility [ 22 ].  Epigenetic effects of endocrine disruptors have been extensively investigated using targeted approaches [ 23 – 26 ]. We have previously shown evidence for DEHP-induced differentially methylated promoters in sperm [ 8 ]. To identify functional DMRs associated with an altered transcription or RNA presence, we tested a new hypothesis that DEHP may exert its deleterious effects on spermatogenesis by also affecting paternally-transmitted sperm RNA.  Sperm cell cytoplasm phagocytosis by Sertoli cells during spermatogenesis and haploid DNA packaging by protamines in mature spermatozoa triggered the misunderstanding that spermatozoa were devoid of RNA and should escape transcription. The discovery that paternal RNA remains present inside spermatozoa and is passed over to the oocyte has shifted this paradigm [ 27 ]. A nuclease-hypersensitive and transcriptionally-competent conformation of chromatin in mouse sperm was discovered to be associated with transcription factors [ 28 ]. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was first considered to be absent from spermatozoa [ 29 ]. However, it was then identified as present, but cleaved [ 30 ], and recently estimated to represent 70% of total sperm RNA with the potential to predict in vitro fertilization prognosis [ 31 ]. In a study by Drosha and Dicer performed in the sperm of conditional knock-out mice lacking mature microRNAs, the injection of wild-type, sperm-derived RNA or small RNA into oocytes during in vitro fertilization rescued the pathological phenotype [ 32 ]. The sperm-borne microRNA “miR-34c” was found to be important for the first cell division via modulation of Bcl-2 expression [ 33 ]. All these observations showed that paternal RNA may contribute to embryo development.  RNA-seq analysis segregated correctly the samples in the two tested conditions ( Fig 2 ). Pathway analysis resulted in the characterization of down-regulated PPAR and TNF signaling pathways combined with up-regulated myosin coding genes associated with calcium binding proteins in the D300 condition ( Fig 3A & 3B ). Indeed, in the current scientific literature, these pathways were described to be involved in spermatozoa physiology and, for some, as a mediator of DEHP toxicity [ 34 – 47 ].  First, docking simulation performed with DEHP or its metabolite MEHP with both PPAR alpha and gamma receptor subtypes showed that DEHP and MEHP could bind to PPAR alpha and gamma subtypes, with a lower binding affinity for DEHP [ 34 ]. Moreover, various studies on the role of PPAR signaling in spermatozoa suggested its involvement in promoting spermatozoa motility across different organisms. PPAR transcripts were significantly higher in high motile semen samples of rams [ 35 ]. Pig spermatozoa motility was increased by the PPAR-ɣ ligand PGJ2 and decreased by the specific GW9662 PPAR-ɣ antagonist [ 36 ]. Activation of PPAR-ɣ was required for spermatozoa motility in humans [ 37 ]. However, experiments performed with PPAR alpha-null (-/-) and wild-type (+/+) male Sv /129 mice revealed that PPAR alpha-independent pathways contributed at least partially to both renal and testicular DEHP toxicity [ 38 ]. Second, a negative impact of TNF-alpha was observed on spermatozoa motility and TNF-blocking therapies are currently under study for the treatment of infertility [ 39 , 40 ]. MEHP induced a stabilization of p53 expression in spermatocytes and an enhancement of a TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway [ 41 ]. In a TNF-alpha knockout mouse model, testicular testosterone levels were decreased and associated with delayed spermatogenesis, reduced testis weight, and hypospermia [ 42 ], whereas others reported a down-regulation by TNF-alpha of the Müllerian inhibiting substance in Sertoli cells [ 43 ]. Third, calcium ion is considered as a key regulator of human sperm function, notably of spermatozoa motility [ 44 ], whereas myosins, belonging to a superfamily of ATP -dependent motor proteins regulated by calcium signals, are involved in different steps of the spermatogenesis process, as recently reviewed [ 45 ]. In brief, myosin participates in the assembly and positioning of the spindle during karyokinesis in meiosis, binds to chromosomes and segregates them by attachment to the microtubules. It then, participates in the acrosomal formation and spermatid individualization [ 45 ]. An impact of DEHP on calcium signaling and/or myosins was observed in studies involving other cell types than spermatozoa and performed in biological contexts other than reproductive toxicology. DEHP suppressed the calcium signaling of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in human neuroblastoma [ 46 ] and induced a decrease in myotube formation in C2C12 cells, associated with reduced MyHC, MyoD and myogenin levels [ 47 ].  Combining MBD-seq to RNA-seq performed under similar conditions, a putative functional epigenetic alteration in seminal vesicle secretory ( Svs) genes and antigen was discovered in the present study (Figs 4 & 5 ; Table 2 ). Genes coding Svs 2, Svs 3b, Sva and Svs 4, which are functionally related to sperm physiology, were statistically significantly down-regulated and associated with statistically significant promoter methylation increases in D300 compared to CTL conditions ( Fig 4C & 4D ), thus compatible with a long-lasting silencing able to be observed months after the last exposure to the endocrine disrupter. No associations between Svs genes and DEHP toxicity were found in previous studies, whereas Svs genes were reported to play fundamental roles in spermatozoa physiology.  Both semenogelin-1 and -2, encoded by Svs2 and Svs3ab genes in mice are the major protein constituents of seminal fluid. They represent 20% to 40% of its proteins and are responsible for the spontaneous coagulation of semen after ejaculation by the formation of a semi-solid gelatinous mass entrapping immotile spermatozoa. The prostate specific antigen ( Pate 4 or Svs 7) rapidly cleaves both semenogelin-1 and -2 and results in semen liquefaction, the initiation of sperm motility, and the production of a peptide presenting antibacterial activity [ 48 ]. Furthermore, Svs 2 (semenogelin-1) attached to ganglioside GM1 on the plasma membrane of the sperm head maintain sterols in place and prevent sperm capacitation in a wrong location or at a wrong time [ 49 ]. Interestingly, Svs 2 knockout male mice were sub-fertile; their sperm did not form plugs and did not survive to artificial insemination [ 50 ]. Seminal vesicle secretory protein IV ( Svs 4) protects spermatozoa against reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [ 51 ]. Both Svs 4 and Svs 6 expression are up-regulated by testosterone. Their transcriptional levels decreased in castrated male mice, but they were restored after administration of testosterone [ 51 , 52 ]. Finally, the seminal vesicle antigen prevents spontaneous acrosome reaction by targeting membrane sphingomyelin and plasma membrane Ca( 2+ )-ATPase activity [ 53 ].  To validate our hypothesis of DEHP-induced de-silencing events, i.e. activation of genes that are normally kept silenced by promoter methylation in the sperm, we screened in the 10 top up-regulated genes increased mRNA expression levels associated with decreased promoter methylation levels in D300 compared to CTL conditions. We identified Gzmk, encoding Granzyme K serine protease usually detected in cytoplasmic granules in both cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells, C1qtnf5 (bicistronic with Mfrp) involved in cell adhesion, as well as non-coding RNA 1700044K03Rik of an unknown function, whereas mir615 (overlapping Hoxc5) RNA expression was significantly dysregulated, but lacked promoter methylation data ( Fig 4E & 4F ). These genes were not reported as involved in sperm physiology, except for mir615, which is putatively involved in gonadal differentiation [ 54 ]. A novel granzyme involved in spermatogenesis was identified in mouse spermatocytes and spermatids [ 55 ].  To conclude, prenatal exposure to DEHP induced a TDS-like syndrome in F1 adult male mice, associated with a putative epigenetic silencing of Svs genes in sperm. The results of this study may be strain-specific and cannot be extrapolated as such to other mouse strains. The next steps of the present large scale analytic study would be to determine to what extent our discoveries are transposable to humans. For instance, it would be interesting to investigate if SEMG1 ( Svs 2 in mice), the gene encoding semenogelin 1, is up-methylated and silenced in association with the symptom of decreased sperm motility in infertile patients. Obvious further research would be to identify biological sperm signatures of human infertility that could be used as biomarkers by mining in the reservoir of the genes found in our study to be affected by prenatal exposure to DEHP. Finally, all the data collected here should allow to conduct additional fundamental studies aimed at understanding the complex pattern of genes controlling testis development and normal sperm physiology.

(F) Sashimi plots generated from RNA-seq data showed a putative unannotated microRNA signature close to the binding site of the reverse primer used in RT-qPCR to measure star . As oligo-dT annealing to the poly-A tails of mature mRNA was used only in RT-qPCR and not in our RNA-seq, the discrepancy between RT-qPCR and RNA-seq measures of star expression levels may be explained by post-transcriptional regulation of star . Further experiments are needed to confirm the presence of this putative unannotated microRNA.

We aim to evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and investigate the association between total, free and bioavailable vitamin D serum concentrations and disease activity. Patients with SLE (ACR 1997) consecutively seen at UNIFESP’s outpatient’s clinics had disease activity measured after clinical and laboratory evaluation using SLEDAI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index). 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum concentrations measured by chemiluminescence and vitamin D binding protein (DBP) measured by ELISA were used to calculate free and bioavailable vitamin D. Healthy blood donors were used as controls. A total of 142 patients (71.4%) had 25(OH)D serum concentrations below 30 ng/mL. Total 25(OH)D serum concentration was associated with disease activity categorized in 5 continuous groups of SLEDAI. 25(OH)D serum concentrations were higher among patients with SLEDAI 1–5 and lower in those with severe activity (SLEDAI≥20) (p <0.05). On the other hand, no statistically significant difference was observed for DBP, free and bioavailable vitamin D measurements in the disease activity subgroups evaluated. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among patients with SLE and was associated with higher disease activity. DBP serum level and calculation of free and bioavailable vitamin D were not associated with SLE disease activity.

Several studies have reported that vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in SLE patients than in the general population [ 2 – 6 ]. One possible explanation for the association between SLE and vitamin D deficiency is the universal recommendation that these patients should avoid sunlight exposure [ 7 ]. Moreover, many drugs used in SLE management, such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine, may interfere with vitamin D metabolism and 25-hidroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum levels [ 8 ]. It has also been suggested that vitamin D deficiency might be a risk factor for the development of the disease, although vitamin D intake was not associated with the risk of SLE development in a prospective study [ 9 ].  Vitamin D deficiency seems to be associated with immunological abnormalities in SLE. Some in vitro evidence implies that vitamin D modulates the differentiation and activity of T and B-lymphocytes and, therefore, the production of autoantibodies [ 10 ]. On the other hand, the association between vitamin D serum concentration with disease activity and prognosis in SLE remains controversial. In spite of some studies with interesting results [ 11 ], the literature still lacks of convincing proof demonstrating that vitamin D supplementation in patients with SLE can modify disease progression.  An association between high disease activity in SLE with low vitamin D serum concentrations has been reported, but these results are controversial [ 12 ]. In children and adolescents with SLE no correlation was found between glucocorticoid or hydroxychloroquine use, cumulative dose of glucocorticoid and vitamin D serum concentration [ 13 ]. Other authors have also failed to demonstrate association between vitamin D and SLE disease activity [ 14 ]. An inverse correlation between vitamin D serum concentration and disease activity in children with juvenile SLE has been reported [ 15 ]. In spite of such association, a causal relationship between vitamin D serum concentration and disease activity in SLE patients could not be established [ 16 ].  Part of the disagreement regarding a potential role for vitamin D in SLE disease activity [ 9 , 12 , 15 , 13 ] may be due to the fact that these studies have not evaluated the free and bioavailable fractions of vitamin D. It is possible that bioavailable and free vitamin D might be more reliable biological markers of vitamin D status than the total 25(OH)D serum concentration measurement. In the present study we assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in a cohort of patients with SLE and examine the association between total, free and bioavailable vitamin D serum measurements with disease activity.    Patients and Methods  The study included a total of 199 patients diagnosed with SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997 classification criteria [ 17 ]. All participants agreed to participate in the study. The inclusion of patients from the Rheumatology Outpatient Clinics at UNIFESP, São Paulo–Brazil, was done by convenience in consecutive clinical appointments from February 2014 to January 2016. A total of 350 patients were evaluated and 199 met inclusion criteria described below.  Patients with overlapping findings with other systemic autoimmune diseases, rituximab use or plasmapheresis six months before or during the course of the study, bone marrow transplantation, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), neoplastic disease (except basal cell carcinoma) and common variable immunodeficiency were excluded. Use of vitamin D supplements was not an exclusion criterion.  All patients were contacted for clarification on the nature of the study and gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Minors/children were not included in the present study. The UNIFESP’s Ethics Committee approved the study protocol.  Anthropometric, demographic and clinical data collected from the electronic medical charts or clinical interview included age, sex, race, weight, height, disease duration and medication in use. Disease activity was measured using Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) at the time that blood samples were collected. Nephritis was assessed taking into account the presence of the following parameters: urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (or 24-hour urine protein) representing 500 mg protein/24 hours or red blood cell casts or renal biopsy with abnormalities suggestive of lupus nephritis.  Potential differences in vitamin D serum concentrations in this sample of patients with SLE were examined using the categorization of disease activity in 5 distinct levels: Inactive disease (SLEDAI = 0), light activity (SLEDAI 1 to 5), moderate activity (SLEDAI 6 to 10), high activity (SLEDAI 11 to 19) and severe activity (≥20 SLEDAI), as previously published [ 18 ]. These categories of SLE disease activity have been established according to the relative risk of death.  A total of 150 healthy volunteers selected among blood donors without SLE were used as control group.  Blood samples were collected by intravenous puncture and serum aliquots were stored at -80°C for the biochemical analyses described below.  25(OH)D serum measurements were performed on a Siemens ADVIA Centaur apparatus using chemiluminescence technique. Total 25(OH)D measurement coefficient of variation using this method is 11.7%.  Vitamin D binding protein (DBP) was measured in SLE patients by monoclonal antibody ELISA (Cloud-Clone Corp. kit—USCN Life Science Inc.) using standard technique. The coefficient of variation (CV%) for DBP measurement is 4.8%. DBP measurements in the study were considered only when duplicate measures were available. In 39 SLE samples DBP was not performed in duplicate and so was not used in the analysis.  DBP measurements were used to calculate free and bioavailable vitamin D according to previously developed equation [ 19 ] further adapted [ 20 ]. Bioavailable vitamin D was calculated as the sum of free vitamin D with 25(OH)D bound to albumin.  Bone densitometry data was available for a total of 107 patients included in the present analysis. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were performed at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and proximal femur (neck and total hip) using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (DPX MD +, GE-Lunar, Madison, WI, USA). The coefficient of variation for BMD measurement was 1.5% and 2% at lumbar spine and total hip, respectively.   Statistical Analysis  Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation for quantitative variables, and frequency and percentage for categorical variables) was used to characterize patients and their groups. Quantitative variables were compared between groups of independent samples using Student's t test for normally distributed variables and Mann-Whitney test for variables with non-normal distribution. For prospective analyses (dependent samples), quantitative variables were compared using ANOVA. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS software version 17.0 (Chicago, IL). Significance level was set as p <0.05.     Results  A total of 199 consecutive patients with SLE were included in the study. Demographic, clinical and laboratorial data for these patients and their healthy controls are shown in Table 1 . SLE patients were 37.2 ± 11.1 years old (range 26 to 48 years old) and mainly women (96%). 25(OH)D serum concentrations were significantly lower in SLE patients as compared to healthy controls matched for age and BMI. Vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D lower than 20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (25(OH)D lower than 30 ng/ml) were highly prevalent in SLE patients. A total of 142 SLE patients (71.4%) had 25(OH)D serum concentrations below 30 ng/mL, significantly higher than that seen for healthy controls (p<0,001). Only 57 SLE patients (28.6%) had 25(OH)D serum concentrations exceeding 30 ng/mL (vitamin D sufficiency). DBP measurements were available for 160 patients with SLE. Free and bioavailable vitamin D was calculated in those patients.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170323.t001  Table 1  Demographic, anthropometric, clinical and laboratorial parameters in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus patients and their healthy controls.

A statistically significant difference between 25(OH)D serum concentrations was observed between the categories of disease activity (p = 0.042; ANOVA, Table 2 ). It was demonstrated a statistically significant difference between 25(OH)D values between inactive disease (SLEDAI = 0) or light activity (SLEDAI 1–5) and severe activity (SLEDAI≥20) (p<0.001; Tukey test). On the other hand, mean values for DBP, free and bioavailable vitamin D did not differ significantly between the categories of disease activity.  The association between vitamin D serum concentration and disease activity in our sample was also tested by assessing the status of vitamin D, as defined by the US Endocrine Society [ 21 ]: deficiency (25(OH)D lower than 20 ng/mL), insufficiency (25(OH)D between 20 and 30 ng/mL) and sufficiency (25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL). Table 3 shows the prevalence of different status of vitamin D according to disease activity. Since there was no statistically significant difference between the statuses insufficiency and deficiency, these two strata were analyzed together and compared to the sufficiency status .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170323.t003  Table 3  Vitamin D status (deficiency: 25(OH)D lower than 20 ng/mL; insufficiency: 25(OH)D between 20 and 30 ng/mL; and sufficiency (25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL) in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus patients, according to disease activity measured by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI).

As shown in Table 3 , the two groups (25(OH)D < 30 ng/mL versus ≥ 30 ng/mL) differ significantly in the proportions of disease activity (p = 0.001). The proportion of patients with vitamin D sufficiency (25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL) is significantly higher in the groups SLEDAI 0 and 1–5 when compared to 25(OH)D values below 30 ng/mL (p = 0.003). In patients with severe activity (SLEDAI ≥20) we observed the contrary: the proportion of patients with 25(OH)D serum concentration lower than 30 ng/mL was significantly higher as compared to values ≥ 30 ng/mL (p = 0.026).  Potential associations between vitamin D status and season, body mass index (BMI), Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and use of medication were also tested. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean serum concentrations of 25(OH)D (p = 0.179), free and bioavailable vitamin D (p = 0.441) between the different seasons (ANOVA) ( S1 Table ).  25(OH)D serum concentrations were not significantly associated with disease duration or BMI. Both free and bioavailable vitamin D was also not associated with those variables.  Spine and hip BMD did not correlate significantly with 25(OH)D, free or bioavailable vitamin D serum concentrations. Moreover, BMD did not differ significantly among the various vitamin D statuses ( S2 Table ).  Possible associations between 25(OH)D serum concentration and the use of medications were considered. Table 4 shows that vitamin D serum levels were not associated significantly with the use of medications commonly used for management of SLE. Only the use of cyclophosphamide was associated with lower 25(OH)D serum concentrations (p = 0.020). This association was not confirmed when the analysis was performed according to the statuses of vitamin D (sufficiency or insufficiency/deficiency) (p = 0.065). A total of 74 patients were in use of cholecalciferol (400 to 1000 IU/day). The data demonstrate that patients taking cholecalciferol had 25(OH)D serum concentrations higher than the others with no supplementation (p<0.001). Similarly, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was significantly higher among patients without supplementation as compared to patients receiving cholecalciferol.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170323.t004  Table 4  Serum 25(OH)D (mean ± SD) and vitamin D status (deficiency: 25(OH)D lower than 20 ng/mL; insufficiency: 25(OH)D between 20 and 30 ng/mL; and sufficiency (25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL) in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus patients, according to medication use.                    25(OH)D(ng/mL)  Deficiency + InsufficiencyN (%)  SufficiencyN (%)      Prednisone  Yes  26.4±7.9  53 (69.7)  23 (30.3)     No  25.7±8.0  89 (72.4)  34 (27.6)    Hydroxychloroquine  Yes  25.6 ±7.3  111 (73.0)  41 (27.0)     No  27.3±9.5  31 (66.0)  16 (34.0)    Azathioprine  Yes  26.2±8.3  28 (65.1)  15 (34.9)     No  25.9±7.8  114 (73.1)  42 (26.9)    Mycophenolate  Yes  27.1±9.1  19 (70.4)  8 (29.6)     No  25.8±7.7  123 (71.5)  49 (28.5)    Cyclophosphamide  Yes  21.3±5.2  13 (92.9)  1 (7.1)     No  26.4±8.0  129 (69.7)  56 (30.3)    Cyclosporine  Yes  29.1±2.6  2 (66.7)  1 (33.3)     No  26.0±8.0  140 (71.4)  56 (28.6)    Methylprednisolone  Yes  23.7±5.7  11 (84.6)  2 (15.4)     No  26.2±8.1  131 (70.4)  55 (29.6)    Methotrexate  Yes  27. 3±7.0  17 (65.4)  9 (34.6)     No  25.8±8.1  125 (72.3)  48 (27.7)    Cholecalciferol  Yes  27.9±7.8 *  26 (35.1)  48 (64.8)       No  24.9±7.7  94 (75.2)  31(24.8)       *p<0.001.      Discussion  In the present study we investigated the association between vitamin D serum concentration, its free and bioavailable fractions and disease activity in SLE patients. We have observed a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among SLE patients. Only 28.6% of the patients were vitamin D sufficient (serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL). Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more frequent in SLE patients than in healthy controls. Vitamin D deficiency is then more prevalence in SLE patients as compared to the Brazilian general population without SLE [ 22 – 25 ]. Significantly lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported in SLE patients in Brazil [ 14 ]. We have also found that disease activity in SLE was associated with lower 25(OH)D serum concentration. On the other hand, measuring DBP with a monoclonal ELISA in this clinical setting has not added information to the status of vitamin D: both free and bioavailable fractions of 25(OH)D did not differ between the various categories of SLE disease activity.  Some cross-sectional studies have shown an inverse correlation between vitamin D serum concentration and disease activity in SLE patients [ 5 , 6 , 12 ]. On the other hand, in 159 SLE patients in the city of Rio de Janeiro, 25(OH)D serum concentration measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) did not correlate with activity or duration of the disease, sunlight exposure, vitamin D supplementation, glucocorticoid use or renal function [ 14 ].  The importance of free and bioavailable vitamin D has been tested in other clinical scenarios. Low 25(OH)D serum levels have been associated with high risk of multiple sclerosis [ 26 ]. Free and bioavailable vitamin D did not differ between multiple sclerosis patients and their healthy controls [ 27 ]. In pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease, both free and bioavailable vitamin D were significantly lower than in healthy controls [ 28 ]. Additionally, it was demonstrated that vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) or D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation in hip fracture patients resulted in no significant differences in free and bioavailable vitamin D [ 29 ].  It was recently demonstrated that DBP measurements using monoclonal ELISA are biased by DBP genotype and race [ 30 ]. DBP values varied significantly when measured by monoclonal or polyclonal ELISA or tandem mass spectrometry and that had implication on free and bioavailable vitamin D calculations. Based on those findings, one could speculate that measuring DBP with polyclonal or tandem mass spectrometry would render different results and that is a limitation of our present study.  Vitamin D serum concentrations did not correlate with the seasons in sample of patients with SLE, unlike what has been observed in the general population [ 21 ]. This is probably the result of the universal recommendation that SLE patients should use continuous photo protection and avoid sun exposure, regardless of the season.  In this study, vitamin D supplementation was associated with increased 25(OH)D serum concentrations. The reported doses of 400 to 1000 IU/day do not seem to be sufficient to ensure adequate levels of vitamin D. About 35% of patients using cholecalciferol still presented vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, suggesting that higher doses are required for proper supplementation in these patients.  Due to its cross-sectional nature, our study cannot establish a causal relationship between vitamin D serum concentration and disease activity in SLE patients. If low vitamin D serum concentrations are causal co-factor in the immunological disturbances that characterize SLE or if, on the contrary, the inflammatory disease process and low sun exposure causes reduction in vitamin D serum concentrations will still require further studies [ 26 ]. It is also possible that the sample size may have affected our results. Perhaps larger samples may establish better relationship between vitamin D measurements and disease activity in SLE patients.  In conclusion, we have demonstrated a very high frequency of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among patients with SLE. In this clinical scenario, disease activity was associated with lower serum concentrations of 25(OH)D. DBP measurements with monoclonal ELISA and free and bioavailable vitamin D calculations did not differ among different categories of SLE disease activity. Prospective studies are needed to investigate and establish a potential causal relationship between vitamin D status and disease activity in SLE.

Purpose  To evaluate the effects of repeated intravitreal ranibizumab injections on corneal sensitivity, corneal sub-basal nerve plexus (SBNP) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).    Methods  Sixty-six eyes of 33 patients who had received unilateral repeated intravitreal ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg/0.05 ml) for the treatment of AMD and 25 eyes of 25 healthy subjects were included in the study. Central corneal sensation was measured using the contact Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer. The laser scanning in vivo corneal confocal microscope was used to determine corneal SBNP parameters. The peripapillary RNFL thickness was assessed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Data obtained from the ranibizumab-injected eyes were compared with those of the fellow non-treated eyes and the eyes of the healthy control subjects.    Results  The mean number of ranibizumab injections per eye was 8.9±5.0 (range 3–20). There were no statistically significant differences in the central corneal sensitivity threshold and corneal SBNP parameters between the ranibizumab-injected eyes and the fellow untreated eyes or between those with neovascular AMD and the healthy control group (P>0.05 for all). The average peripapillary RNFL thickness of the treated eyes did not differ significantly to the fellow eyes (P = 0.237), and the eyes of healthy control subjects (P = 0.918). There were no significant correlations between the number of ranibizumab injections and any of the study parameters.    Conclusions  Multiple intravitreal injections of ranibizumab seem to have no harmful effects on corneal sensitivity, innervation and peripapillary RNFL thickness in patients with AMD.

Neovascular or exudative AMD, characterized by new formation of choroidal vessels into the sub-retinal space, is responsible for almost 90% of severe vision loss due to AMD [ 2 ]. Although the age-related changes that stimulate pathologic neovascularization are not completely understood, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), which is a key regulator of angiogenesis and vascular permeability, has been implicated as an important factor in the pathogenesis of AMD [ 3 , 4 ].  Ranibizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment that neutralizes all known active forms of VEGF-A, has widely been used via intravitreal injection for the treatment of neovascular AMD [ 5 ]. However, the effect of VEGF is not limited to angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Reassuringly a recent study has shown no effect on corneal endothelial cell density or morphology after intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab in patients with diabetic macular edema [ 6 ]. However, experimental studies have documented that VEGF is expressed by neurons mediating neuroprotective and neurotrophic activities [ 7 – 9 ], and neutralization of VEGF, using anti-VEGF antibodies impairs regeneration of the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus (SBNP) in injured mice corneas [ 10 ]. Repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab might therefore induce a detrimental effect on the corneal SBNP and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Several studies have investigated the effects of anti-VEGF on RNFL, reporting either decreased, increased or unchanged RNFL thickness in the eye treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents [ 11 – 15 ]. To our knowledge, there are no data in the current literature regarding the effects of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents on the human corneal SBNP.  In this study, we evaluated the effects of repeated intravitreal ranibizumab injections on corneal sensitivity, corneal SBNP morphology and peripapillary RNFL thickness in patients with neovascular AMD.    Materials and Methods  Thirty-three patients (16 male, 17 female) with unilateral neovascular AMD who had received at least three injections of intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis; Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) and 25 healthy control subjects (14 male, 11 female) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study undertaken at a tertiary referral center. The study design fulfilled the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Necmettin Erbakan University. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients after a detailed explanation of the nature and possible consequences of the study.  Medical records of all patients were reviewed for age, gender, pre-existing glaucoma, use of anti-glaucomatous medications and clinical examination findings. The total number of intravitreal injections and the time elapsed from the last injection were also recorded. The patients had received initially three monthly intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 ml) injections. Afterward, re-injections had been performed according to an “as needed” protocol based on the PrONTO trial [ 16 ]. None of the patients experienced systemic or ocular complications including intraocular inflammation, endophthalmitis, or thromboembolic events. Patients were excluded if they had a history of glaucoma, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) during follow-up, trauma or ophthalmic surgery, any corneal pathology and coexisting retinal or neuro-ophthalmologic diseases. Patients with systemic diseases other than controlled hypertension were also considered ineligible.  All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including anterior segment biomicroscopy, IOP assessment and fundus examination. The patients with neovascular AMD were included if the fellow eye was without AMD findings or just early dry AMD. Data obtained from the ranibizumab-injected eyes were compared with those of the fellow eyes. Since the intravitreal administration of ranibizumab may affect the fellow eyes of the patients via the systemic circulation, 25 eyes of 25 healthy subjects were also included.  Central corneal sensation was measured before the IOP assessment, using a contact nylon thread esthesiometer (Luneau 12/100 mm Cochet-Bonnet; Luneau, Prunay le Gillon, France). The nylon filament, which mechanically stimulates corneal nerves, was applied with a low pressure perpendicularly to the center of the cornea. Starting from 6 cm, the filament length was progressively reduced in 5-mm steps until the first response occurred. The longest filament length (cm) resulting in a positive response was verified twice and recorded as the indicator of the central corneal sensitivity [ 17 ].  The laser scanning in vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCCM) was performed on all subjects using the Rostock Corneal Module/Heidelberg Retina Tomograph lll (RCM/HRT lll; Heidelberg Engineering GmBH, Dossenheim, Germany). The full thickness of the central cornea was scanned by using the device’s “section” mode. The total duration of IVCCM examination was approximately 2 minutes per eye, and none of the subjects experienced any visual symptoms or corneal complications as a result of examination. The best-focused SBNP images were considered for the analysis. Automatic CCMetrics software, ver. 2.0 (University of Manchester, UK) was used for the quantitative analysis of the nerve fibers [ 18 ]. Three parameters were quantified: corneal nerve fiber density (NFD), the total number of major nerves per square millimeter; nerve fiber length (NFL), the total length of all nerve fibers and branches (millimeters per square millimeter); and nerve branch density (NBD), the number of branches emanating from major nerve trunks per square millimeter [ 19 ]. All of the image analyses were performed by a single masked observer.  The peripapillary RNFL thickness measurements were obtained using a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). The OCT scanning circle (size: 3.4 mm) was manually positioned at the center of the optic disc and the average peripapillary RNFL thickness (μm) was recorded.  Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS ver. 17.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) software. Basic descriptive statistics were calculated on all the data gathered and are reported as the mean±SD or n (%), as appropriate. The Pearson χ 2 test was used to compare the categorical parameters. Normal distribution of continuous variables was confirmed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Paired samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed ranks tets was used to compare the parameters between the ranibizumab-injected eyes and fellow eyes. Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the parameters between the ranibizumab-injected eyes and the eyes of healthy control subjects. The correlations between the number of injections and corneal sensitivity threshold, peripapillary RNFL thickness and corneal SBNP parameters were measured by using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. For all evaluations, a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.    Results  The mean ages of the patients and control group were 67.91±7.29 years (range 55–81 years) and 66.24±7.24 years (range 56–85 years), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between patients with AMD and healthy controls for age (P = 0.391) and gender (P = 0.571). No significant differences were observed in central corneal sensitivity threshold, corneal SBNP parameters and peripapillary RNFL thickness between male and female genders in both the AMD and control groups (P>0.05 for all). The mean number of injections was 8.9±5.0 (range 3–20) and the mean time elapsed from the last intravitreal injection treatment was 2.7±1.7 months (range 1–6 months). The mean IOP of eyes receiving ranibizumab injections (14.79±2.58 mmHg) did not differ significantly from those of the fellow eyes (14.73±2.75 mmHg) and control eyes (13.56±2.66 mmHg) (P = 0.837 and P = 0.082, respectively).  Table 1 shows the comparison of central corneal sensitivity threshold, corneal SBNP parameters and peripapillary RNFL thickness among ranibizumab-injected eyes and fellow eyes of the patients with AMD and the healthy control group. Representative IVCCM images of the central cornea showing the SBNP in a patient with neovascular AMD and a healthy control subject are given in Fig 1 . There were no statistically significant differences between the ranibizumab-injected eyes and fellow eyes, as well as the ranibizumab-injected eyes and control eyes (P>0.05 for all). In order to detect any early changes on corneal nerves, the results of a subgroup including 12 patients who had received ranibizumab one month prior to the examination were analysed separately and no significant differences were observed in any of the study parameters between the ranibizumab-injected eyes and fellow eyes (The average values of the parameters for the ranibizumab-injected eyes and fellow eyes are as follows: 5.63 ± 0.57 vs. 5.75 ± 0.34 for the central corneal sensation, 24.48 ± 11.45 vs. 29.16 ± 10.44 for NFD, 33.33 ± 19.27 vs. 36.97 ± 11.95 for NBD, 16.49 ± 3.42 vs. 16.52 ± 4.41 for NFL, and 94.83 ± 6.60 vs. 89.92 ± 12.23 for the RNFL thickness; P>0.05 for all).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170271.g001  Fig 1   In vivo corneal confocal microscopic images of the central cornea showing the sub-basal nerve plexus in the ranibizumab-injected eye (A) and fellow eye (B) of a patient with neovascular AMD and the eye of a healthy control subject (C).      10.1371/journal.pone.0170271.t001  Table 1  Comparison of the study parameters in ranibizumab-injected eyes and fellow eyes of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and the eyes of healthy control subjects.

Among the 33 patients with AMD, 11 (33.3%) had treated and controlled hypertension.

No significant correlations were observed between the number of ranibizumab injections and any of the study parameters (P>0.05 for all). There was a significant positive correlation between central corneal sensitivity threshold and NFD (r = 0.362; P = 0.005).    Discussion  The use of intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of retinal diseases, especially neovascular AMD, is now common practice. We found no significant change in corneal sensation or corneal nerve and retinal nerve fiber morphology in ranibizumab-injected eyes. This is reassuring given the theoretical concern of a potentially detrimental effect on nerves in the eye following anti-VEGF therapy, given that endogenous VEGF has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects [ 20 ]. Indeed, Matsuzaki et al [ 21 ]. have demonstrated direct protective effects of VEGF-A on cultured neuronal cells. It has also been shown that a chronic decrease in endogenous VEGF-A levels is linked to an increased risk of motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 22 ]. In a more recent study, Hulse et al [ 23 ]. reported that VEGF-A165b, which is a splice isoform of VEGF-A, had neuroprotective and anti-nociceptive effects on epidermal sensory neurons in diabetic rats. In relation to neural changes there are experimental data showing the neuroprotective role of VEGF on retinal neural cells [ 8 , 24 ].  The role of VEGF on corneal innervation and nerve repair has also been investigated. Yu et al [ 10 ]. have shown a significant effect of VEGF on the growth of peripheral trigeminal neurons innervating the cornea in mice and suggested that blockage of VEGF signaling impairs regeneration of the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus after injury. Similarly, another recent study has demonstrated the neuroregenerative role of VEGF on corneal nerves using an avascular corneal nerve injury model [ 25 ]. These experiments provide support for the critical impact of VEGF on corneal and retinal neural cells and the potential for harm to ocular neural tissue in patients undergoing chronic anti-VEGF treatment. This provides the rationale for assessing the effect of ranibizumab on corneal nerves and peripapillary RNFL in patients with neovascular AMD.  Many studies have assessed the effects of anti-VEGF agents on the RNFL [ 11 , 13 – 15 , 26 ]. Theoretically, RNFL alterations could be induced by the IOP elevation in response to volume increase or through a direct neurotoxic effect of the drug. A short-term transient IOP rise occurs with intravitreal drug administration, but is limited to the first few minutes following injection and returns to baseline within 30–60 minutes [ 27 , 28 ]. We have not measured the IOP immediately after the injection and therefore cannot assess the contribution of this temporary rise in IOP to any effect on RNFL thickness. Although Martinez-de-la-Casa et al [ 11 ]. have demonstrated a significant decrease in RNFL thickness in 49 patients with neovascular AMD treated with a mean number of 4.8 ranibizumab injections, the majority of researchers have shown that repeated intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents are not associated with a change in RNFL [ 13 – 15 , 26 ]. Similarly in this study, we have also not observed any significant correlation between the number of injections and RNFL thickness.  Although several studies have investigated the effects of anti-VEGF on RNFL, no prior study has addressed the possible effects of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents on the corneal SBNP. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that ranibizumab concentration peaks in aqueous humor 1–3 days after intravitreal injection and subsequently declines with a half life of 2.84 days in rabbits [ 29 ] and 7.19 days in human [ 30 ]. In an experimental study by Dratviman-Storobinsky et al [ 31 ], immunostaining showed bevacizumab in the anterior chamber and corneal stroma one day after intravitreal injection, suggesting that bevacizumab had reached the corneal stroma by passive diffusion via the endothelium. Since ranibizumab is a smaller molecule than bevacizumab, it is possible that ranibizumab may also reach the corneal stroma and have a deleterious effect on corneal nerves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the morphology and function of corneal SBNP after repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. We find no significant change in corneal sensation or corneal nerve morphology in ranibizumab-injected eyes. A limitation of this study is that the preinjection evaluations have not been performed due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. Further prospective studies with larger numbers of subjects including pseudophakic, aphakic, or vitrectomized eyes are recommended to fully evaluate the potential harmful effects of intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents.  In animal studies, the aqueous humor concentrations of ranibizumab in the non-injected fellow eye have found to be below the limit of detection and aqueous humor VEGF concentrations of the fellow eye remain unchanged following intravitreal injection [ 29 , 32 ]. Additionally, Gamulescu and Helbig [ 33 ] have reported no contralateral eye effect in a short-term prospective study of 26 patients with bilateral neovascular AMD who had received ranibizumab injection in one eye. Although Rouvas et al [ 34 ]. observed a positive impact of ranibizumab on the visual acuity of the fellow eye in patients with bilateral AMD. Given that a single intravitreal administration of 0.5 mg of ranibizumab in monkeys results in a maximum serum concentration of 150 ng/ml [ 35 ], a systemic effect on the contralateral eye should also be accounted for. Therefore a healthy control group was also included in the present study. No significant differences were observed between ranibizumab-injected eyes and the eyes of healthy controls for any of the parameters.  In conclusion, repeated treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab has no adverse effects on corneal sensation, corneal SBNP morphology and peripapillary RNFL thickness.

An abnormal increase in osteoclast differentiation and activation results in various bone-resorptive diseases, including periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Chemical compounds containing pyrimidine ring have been shown to regulate a variety of biological processes. Therefore, in order to identify an antiresorptive agent, we synthesized a series of pyrimidine ring-containing chemical compounds, and found that OCLI-023 suppressed the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts in vitro . OCLI-023 directly inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced differentiation of bone marrow macrophages into osteoclasts, without a cytotoxic response. OCLI-023 also downregulated the RANKL-induced mRNA expression of osteoclast markers as well as inhibited the formation of actin rings and resorption pits. OCLI-023 attenuated the RANKL-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell signaling pathways. In a mouse model of periodontitis, ligature induced an increase of distance between cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and alveolar bone crest (ABC) in the second molar, and OCLI-023 significantly reduced it. Histological analysis showed ligature-induced increase of osteoclast numbers was also significantly reduced by OCLI-023. These data demonstrated the inhibitory effect of OCLI-023 on osteoclast differentiation and activity of osteoclasts in vitro , as well as on ligature-induced bone loss in vivo , and OCLI-023 can be proposed as a novel anti-resorptive compound.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725  National Research Foundation of Korea    2008-0062282   Eui Kyun Park     This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIP) (2008-0062282).

Osteoblasts, generated from mesenchymal stem cells, synthesize and mineralize the bone matrix, while osteoclasts are formed by the cellular fusion of monocyte/macrophage-lineage cells and resorb mineralized bone tissue [ 2 , 3 ]. Accurate regulation of bone formation and bone resorption is a key factor affecting normal bone remodeling. Abnormal bone remodeling, caused by the disproportionately increased bone destruction, leads to various bone diseases, including periodontitis [ 2 – 4 ]. Therefore, the reduction of osteoclast differentiation and/or resorbing activity could be an effective way to manage such bone diseases.  Osteoclastogenesis and the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts are mainly governed by the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) synthesized by osteoblasts/stromal cells [ 5 , 6 ]. The interaction of RANK and RANKL triggers various signaling cascades that activate intracellular signaling molecules, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). Subsequently, the signaling pathways lead to an increase in the expression of osteoclast-specific genes and bone resorption [ 7 , 8 ].  Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease characterized by elevated alveolar bone resorption. Bacterial pathogens trigger a local inflammatory response, which stimulates the innate immune system [ 9 , 10 ]. The initial local inflammatory response progresses to the gingival tissue through the action of an array of cytokines and mediators [ 9 , 10 ]. The inflammatory response then drives the destruction of the alveolar bone by activated osteoclasts [ 11 ]. Before periodontitis progresses to the advanced stage where the only valuable treatment is tooth extraction, it is necessary to control alveolar bone loss. Howerer, therapeutic intervention for alveolar bone resorption is currently unavailable.  Pyrimidine, a well-known heterocyclic ring containing two nitrogen atoms, is found in both natural and synthetic compounds, such as nucleotides, thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, and barbiturates [ 12 ]. It is known that pyrimidine derivatives and analogs exhibit extensive biological and pharmacological activity, including anti-bacterial, anti-HIV, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer effects [ 13 – 15 ]. Because of these useful functions, a variety of pyrimidine derivatives have been synthesized and investigated as therapeutic agents. Vandyke and colleagues found that a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, which contains the pyrimidine ring, inhibited the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts, thus impairing bone metabolism [ 16 ]. In addition, an inhibitor of tyrosine-protein kinase BTK, ibrutinib, also containing the pyrimidine ring, ameliorated osteoclast-mediated bone destruction [ 17 ].  In this study, we synthesized novel pyrimidine derivatives, including OCLI-023, evaluated their capability to suppress RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, and investigated the molecular mechanisms. We also examined the effect of OCLI-023 on ligature-induced experimental periodontitis in mice.    Materials and Methods   Chemicals and reagents  Recombinant mouse M-CSF and mouse RANKL were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). OCLI-023, N -(2-(methylthio)-6-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)-1 H -indazol-6-amine ( Fig 1A ), is a chemical compound that was synthesized by the addition of 1 H -indazol-6-amine and 1-(pyridin-2-yl)piperazine to 4,6-dichloro-2-(methylthio)pyrimidine.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170159.g001  Fig 1   Effects of OCLI-023 on osteoclast differentiation in RANKL-stimulated BMMs.  (A) Chemical structure of OCLI-023. (B) BMMs were incubated for 3 days with M-CSF (10 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of 1 μM or 5 μM OCLI-023. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT assay. (C) BMMs were cultured with M-CSF (10 ng/mL) and RANKL (20 ng/mL) either with or without 1 μM or 5 μM OCLI-023. After 4 or 5 days, the cells were fixed and stained with TRAP. Magnification; 50X. (D) TRAP-positive multinucleated cells with ≥3 nuclei were scored. ** p < 0.01 versus the vehicle-treated control. (E) BMMs were cultured on glass coverslips for 4 days with M-CSF (10 ng/mL) and RANKL (20 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of OCLI-023 (5 μM). The cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and DAPI to visualize actin rings and nuclei, respectively. (F) The number of actin rings was analyzed. ** p < 0.01 versus the vehicle-treated control.       Osteoclast differentiation  Osteoclast differentiation was performed as previously described [ 18 ]. Bone marrow cells obtained from 6- to 8-week-old C57B6/L mice (Dae Han Bio Link, Chungbuk, Korea) were incubated in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 24 h, non-adherent cells were centrifuged on a Histopaque density gradient (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and M-CSF (30 ng/mL) for 3 days to obtain bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). BMMs were cultured with RANKL (20 ng/mL) and M-CSF (10 ng/mL) in the absence or presence of 1 μM or 5 μM OCLI-023 for 4 days. Then, the cells were stained with a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-staining solution prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs), having three or more nuclei, were counted as osteoclast-like cells.    Cell viability assay  The effect of OCLI-023 on the viability of BMMs was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma-Aldrich). BMMs were cultured with 1 μM or 5 μM OCLI-023 in the presence of M-CSF (10 ng/mL). After 3 days, MTT was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 2 h. The formazan crystals were extracted with dimethyl sulfoxide, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a 96-well microplate reader (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).    Analysis of gene expression  Total RNA was isolated from cells using the TRI-solution (Bioscience, Seoul, Korea), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in a LightCycler 1.5 real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) using TOPreal qPCR 2× PreMIX with SYBR green (Enzynomics, Daejeon, Korea). The amplification conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation for 10 s at 95°C, annealing for 15 s at 60°C, and extension for 10 s at 72°C. The primers used for the PCR were as described previously [ 19 ].    Immunoblot analysis  Whole-cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer [50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and protease and phosphatase inhibitors]. The protein concentration was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA), and equal amounts of total protein (25 μg) were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ, USA). The membranes were incubated with 3% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T (25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) to block nonspecific binding. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected using the WesternBright enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Advansta, Menlo Park, CA, USA). The antibodies against phospho-JNK (#9251), phospho-IκBα (#2859), and IκBα (#9242) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA), and monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (A5441) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).    Actin ring staining  Mouse BMMs were plated on glass coverslips in the presence or absence of 5 μM OCLI-023. After 4 days in culture, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO, USA) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) to visualize F-actin and nuclei, respectively. Fluorescent images were obtained using a BX51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).    Bone resorption assay  Mouse BMMs seeded on bone slices (IDS Nordic, Herlev, Denmark) were incubated with M-CSF and RANKL to induce osteoclast differentiation. After formation of multinucleated osteoclasts, the cells were incubated with or without 5 μM OCLI-023 for 2 more days. After incubation, all adherent cells were removed from the bone slices, and resorption pits were stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin solution. The area of resorbed pits was measured using the i-Solution image analysis software (IMT i-Solution, Daejeon, Korea).    Ligature-induced alveolar bone loss model and histomorphometric analysis  All animal experiments were approved by the committees on the care and use of animals in research at Kyungpook National University and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. To examine the efficacy of OCLI-023 in vivo , seven-week old male C57B6/L mice were assigned to the following four groups, with five mice in each: nonligation with vehicle (NL + V), nonligation with OCLI-023 (NL + OCLI-023), ligation with vehicle (L + V), and ligation with OCLI-023 (L + OCLI-023) groups. According to a previously published method, alveolar bone resorption was induced by ligation of 5–0 silk around the maxillary left second molar [ 20 ]. The vehicle or OCLI-023 (30 mg/kg) was injected to mice intraperitoneally for 7 days, starting on day 1. All mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide on day 8, and the maxillae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed maxillae were scanned using a SkyScan 1272 high-resolution micro-computed tomography (μCT) system (Bruker, Kontich, Belgium) with a source voltage of 70 kV, current of 142 μA, and resolution of 6 μm. Three-dimensional images were obtained using the CTvox software, and to assess the alveolar bone loss, a linear distance from the CEJ to the ABC of the maxillary second molar was measured. For histological analysis, the fixed maxillae were decalcified with EDTA and embedded in paraffin. Sections (6 μm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and TRAP.    Statistical analyses  All experiments were conducted three times, and the data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed by the two-tailed Student’s t -test or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s multiple comparison post-hoc test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.     Results   Effects of OCLI-023 on viability of BMMs and on osteoclastogenesis  To examine the effect of OCLI-023 on the viability of osteoclast precursors (mouse BMMs), BMMs were cultured with M-CSF either with or without OCLI-023 (1 μM or 5 μM) for 3 days. We observed that neither low nor high concentrations of OCLI-023 affected the viability of BMMs compared with the control ( Fig 1B ). To elucidate whether OCLI-023 inhibits the RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation of BMMs, mouse BMMs stimulated with M-CSF (10 ng/mL) and RANKL (20 ng/mL) were incubated with or without 1 μM or 5 μM OCLI-023. As shown in Fig 1C , M-CSF and RANKL induced differentiation of BMMs into TRAP-positive MNCs (positive control), whereas treatment with OCLI-023 inhibited RANKL-stimulated osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig 1C ). The number of TRAP-positive MNCs was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, and at 5 μM OCLI-023, the formation of MNCs was suppressed by 72.1% ( p < 0.01) ( Fig 1D ).  We next examined the effect of OCLI-023 on the formation of both multinucleated cells and actin rings, which are morphological features of osteoclasts. Stimulation with M-CSF and RANKL led to cellular fusion into MNCs and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig 1E ). However, OCLI-023 significantly inhibited the cellular fusion of osteoclast precursors and the formation of actin rings ( Fig 1E and 1F ).    Effect of OCLI-023 on the expression of osteoclastic marker genes  We investigated the mRNA expression of osteoclastic marker genes to confirm the effect of OCLI-023 on osteoclast differentiation. Expression of RANKL-induced nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 ( Nfatc1 ), encoding the central transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis (NFATc1), was attenuated by OCLI-023 ( Fig 2A ). Consistent with the decreased expression of Nfatc1 , OCLI-023 suppressed the expression of osteoclast-specific genes, including Acp5 (TRAP) and Ctsk (cathepsin K). In accordance with reduced cell–cell fusion and actin ring formation, expression of the Dcstamp gene encoding the dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), a chief regulator of cellular fusion of preosteoclasts, was downregulated by OCLI-023 ( Fig 2A ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170159.g002  Fig 2   Effects of OCLI-023 on RANKL-induced mRNA expression during osteoclast differentiation and resorption pit formation.  (A) BMMs were cultured in the presence of M-CSF (10 ng/mL) and RANKL (20 ng/mL) with vehicle or OCLI-023 (5 μM). The mRNA expression of TRAP ( Acp5 ), cathepsin K ( Ctsk ), DC-STAMP ( Dcstamp ), and NFATc1 ( Nfatc1 ) was analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR. (B) BMMs were seeded on bone slices and incubated with M-CSF (10 ng/mL) and RANKL (20 ng/mL) to induce osteoclast differentiation. After 3 days, the cells were incubated with or without OCLI-023 (5 μM) for an additional 2 days. Resorption pits were observed by hematoxylin staining (upper) and scanning electron microscopy (lower). ** p < 0.01 versus the vehicle-treated control.       Effect of OCLI-023 on bone resorption activity  As the major role of mature osteoclasts is to resorb mineralized tissue, we questioned whether OCLI-023 affects the resorbing activity of osteoclasts. To test this hypothesis, we generated osteoclast-like MNCs from BMMs on bone slices using M-CSF and RANKL. Then, the cells were incubated with or without OCLI-023 for an additional 2 days in an osteoclastogenic medium. The slices were stained with a hematoxylin solution, and we observed enlarged resorption pits in the positive control ( Fig 2B ). Treatment with OCLI-023 prevented the formation of resorption pits compared to the control (95% reduction), indicating that OCLI-023 significantly inhibits the resorbing function of osteoclasts ( Fig 2B ).    Effect of OCLI-023 on RANKL-induced signaling pathways  The interaction between RANKL and RANK stimulates various signaling molecules essential for osteoclastogenesis and resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts. In particular, the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways have pivotal roles in osteoclast differentiation and function. To understand the underlying inhibitory mechanism of OCLI-023, BMMs were pretreated with OCLI-023 or the vehicle and stimulated with RANKL. Increased phosphorylation of JNK was observed in the vehicle-treated control, while RANKL-induced phosphorylation of JNK was reduced by treatment with OCLI-023 ( Fig 3 ). In addition, phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, induced by the RANKL stimulation, was abrogated when the BMMs were pretreated with OCLI-023, indicating that OCLI-023 attenuates the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and resorbing activity by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, as well as phosphorylation of JNK ( Fig 3 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170159.g003  Fig 3   Effects of OCLI-023 on RANKL-stimulated signaling.  BMMs were serum-starved for 5 h, then pretreated with OCLI-023 (5 μM) or vehicle for 1 h before RANKL (50 ng/mL) stimulation for the indicated times. Phosphorylation of JNK and IκBα was assessed by western blot. JNK or β-actin was used as the loading control.       Effect of OCLI-023 on ligature-induced alveolar bone resorption  To examine the in vivo effect of OCLI-023 on periodontitis, the ligature-induced alveolar bone loss was assessed in mice. Both nonligated and ligated mice were administered with either vehicle or OCLI-023. The μCT images shown in Fig 4A revealed a serious alveolar bone loss of the maxillary left second molar in the ligated groups. However, the administration of OCLI-023 significantly reduced the bone resorption induced by the ligation ( Fig 4A ). The distance from the CEJ to the ABC of the molar on the palatal and buccal sides was decreased by 25.9% and 17.5%, respectively ( Fig 4B ). In addition, the interdental and interradicular septa of the alveolar process became eroded due to the ligature, but OCLI-023 reduced the ligature-induced alveolar process loss ( Fig 4A , lower, arrows). Consistent with the μCT images, the histological sections stained with H&E showed the protective activity of OCLI-023 against alveolar bone resorption ( Fig 5A ). Resorption of both interdental and interradicular septa of the alveolar process, caused by the ligature, was substantially reversed by OCLI-023 ( Fig 5A , H&E). The administration of OCLI-023 also suppressed the increase of the osteoclast number induced by the ligature, which suggested that OCLI-023 inhibits osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vivo ( Fig 5A , TRAP and Fig 5B ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170159.g004  Fig 4   Micro-CT analysis of alveolar bones in mice with experimental periodontitis.

Discussion  Anti-resorptive therapeutic agents including bisphosphonates can help prevent or slow the progression of skeletal diseases [ 21 ]. In spite of their beneficial effects, these medications can trigger various side effects, such as gastrointestinal problems and hypocalcemia [ 21 , 22 ]. Hence, there have been extensive efforts to develop alternative medicines that can inhibit both osteoclast differentiation and the resorbing function of osteoclasts, without triggering any undesirable adverse events. In this study, we found that OCLI-023, a newly synthesized pyrimidine derivative, significantly inhibited the RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation in BMMs, as well as bone resorption of mature osteoclasts, by affecting the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways. In addition, OCLI-023 suppressed alveolar bone loss induced by ligature in an in vivo model.  It is well known that the induction of NFATc1 expression is increased through the NF-κB, c-Fos, and calcium-calcineurin pathways activated by RANKL stimulation, and that NFATc1 is a principal regulator of RANKL-stimulated osteoclastogenesis [ 23 ]. Young mice with conditionally deleted Nfatc1 exhibit osteopetrosis due to impaired osteoclast differentiation [ 24 ]. In addition, ectopic expression of NFATc1 leads to the differentiation of BMMs into osteoclasts without RANKL stimulation [ 25 ]. In our study, OCLI-023 attenuated the mRNA expression of Nfatc1 , suggesting that OCLI-023 targets NFATc1 to interrupt RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis ( Fig 2A ).  NFATc1 is capable of enhancing transcription of osteoclast-specific genes, such as Acp5 , Ctsk , and Dcstamp [ 25 ]. Downregulation of Nfatc1 expression by OCLI-023 treatment led to decreased expression levels of the osteoclast-specific genes ( Fig 2A ). Among these genes, Dcstamp encodes a pivotal factor for cellular fusion during osteoclast differentiation [ 26 ]. We found that the cell–cell fusion of osteoclast precursors and actin ring formation were impaired by OCLI-023, suggesting that the important osteoclastogenic processes of multinucleated giant cell formation and cytoskeletal rearragements were suppressed by OCLI-023 through the inhibition of Dcstamp expression.  The RANKL-stimulated MAPK signaling pathways regulate the transcription of genes involved in osteoclast differentiation [ 2 ]. In particular, Ikeda and colleagues reported that the c-Jun signaling cascade performed an essential function in both RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and the regulation of osteoclast apoptosis [ 27 , 28 ]. OCLI-023 considerably attenuated the JNK phosphorylation induced in response to RANKL ( Fig 3 ). The NF-κB signaling pathway is also activated by RANKL stimulation, and several studies of genetically modified mice have revealed that the NF-κB pathway is crucially involved in osteoclast differentiation. The deletion of NF-κB p50 and p52 results in osteopetrosis in mice owing to the defects in osteoclast formation [ 29 ]. In addition, the IκB kinase beta, which is required for phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequent NF-κB activation, is essential for osteoclast differentiation [ 30 ]. We observed that OCLI-023 blocked the RANKL-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα ( Fig 3 ). Taken together, these results indicate that OCLI-023 exerts its inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation and the bone-resorbing function by suppression of the JNK and NF-κB signaling pathways.  As pyrimidine derivatives exhibit a wide range of biological and therapeutic activities, pyrimidine and its derivatives have been the subjects of many investigations [ 31 – 33 ]. A thienopyrimidine compound, NSL-1406, inhibits the bone-resorbing function of osteoclasts as a result of its cytotoxic activity on osteoclasts [ 34 ]. Substituted 5,7-diphenyl-pyrrolo[2,3- d ]-pyrimidines lead to osteoclast apoptosis through the sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases [ 35 ] and c-Src kinase [ 36 ]. Unlike these derivatives, OCLI-023 exhibits inhibitory action on both osteoclastogenesis and the resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts, with no substantial cytotoxicity ( Fig 1 ). We believe that different effects of OCLI-023 on osteoclasts from other pyrimidine derivatives arise because it may target different signaling molecules/pathways such as JNK and NF-kB in RANKL signaling pathways ( Fig 3 ).  Periodontitis is an osteolytic bone disease that leads to the destruction of alveolar bones around the teeth and, ultimately, the loss of teeth. Because periodontitis progress is closely associated with enhanced osteoclast formation and/or bone-resorbing activity, the inhibition of osteoclast formation and/or osteoclastic bone resorption may be an effective strategy for the therapeutic intervention for periodontitis. In addition to the inhibitory effect of OCLI-023 on osteoclast differentiation and function in vitro , the treatment with OCLI-023 also considerably attenuated the alveolar bone destruction in a mouse model of experimental periodontitis (Figs 4 and 5 ). OCLI-023 protected both interdental and interradicular septa of the alveolar processes from ligature-induced alveolar bone loss, suggesting that the osteoclast formation and activation are substantially inhibited by OCLI-023. TRAP staining demonstrated that the osteoclast numbers were significantly reduced by OCLI-023 ( Fig 5A , lower and Fig 5B ). These results suggest that OCLI-023 can suppress alveolar bone resorption by targeting osteoclasts, however, we could not exclude the possibility that OCLI-023 may also regulate osteoblast differentiation and formation [ 37 ]. Furthermore, the limitation of this study is that direct target molecule of OCLI-023 is undefined.  In conclusion, the present study showed that OCLI-023, a newly synthesized pyrimidine derivative, inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and the resorbing activity of osteoclasts via suppression of the JNK and NF-κB pathways in vitro and reduced the alveolar bone loss in vivo . Therefore, we suggest that OCLI-023 may have the potential to improve bone quality and/or prevent bone loss.     References  1 V Kartsogiannis  , KW Ng  .

Mitigating direct and indirect interactions between marine predators and fisheries is a motivating factor for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), especially where predators and fisheries compete for a shared resource. One difficulty in advancing EBFM is parameterizing clear functional responses of predators to indices of prey availability. Alternative characterizations of fishery-predator interactions may therefore benefit the implementation of EBFM. Telemetry data identify foraging areas used by predators and, therefore, represent critical information to mitigate potential competition between predators and fisheries. We analyzed six years (2009–2014) of telemetry data collected at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island and Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, on three species of Pygoscelid penguins and female Antarctic fur seals. In this region, all four species are primarily dependent on Antarctic krill. The tracking data demonstrate local movements near breeding colonies during the austral summer and dispersal from breeding colonies during the winter. We then assessed overlap between predators and the Antarctic krill fishery on a suite of spatiotemporal scales to examine how different data aggregations affect the extent and location of overlap. Concurrent overlap was observed on all spatiotemporal scales considered throughout the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands region, including near tagging locations and in distant areas where recent fishing activity has concentrated. Overlap occurred at depths where mean krill densities were relatively high. Our results demonstrate that direct overlap of krill-dependent predators with the krill fishery on small spatiotemporal scales is relatively common throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region. As the krill fishery continues to develop and efforts to implement ecosystem-based management mature, indices of overlap may provide a useful metric for indicating where the risks of fishing are highest. A precautionary approach to allocating krill catches in space would be to avoid large increases in catch where overlap on small spatiotemporal scales is common.

This is particularly true for the management of fisheries that target low- and mid-trophic level organisms that are major energy pathways from primary production to upper trophic levels [ 2 – 4 ]. In such cases, removal or displacement of potential prey items by a fishery may impact predators by altering, inter alia , their foraging behaviors, reproductive success, and survival. However, assigning causation of predator responses to changes in prey availability, including indices such as biomass, recruitment, total catch by a fishery, and harvest rates, remains difficult in many instances [ 5 ], but see [ 6 , 7 ]. Such uncertainty limits the implementation of EBFM.  The recognition of potential competition between predators and fisheries and the desire to minimize the risks that fishing will irreversibly change marine ecosystems, however, lay at the heart of EBFM as implemented by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). In the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, a mid-water trawl fishery for Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) currently catches about 300,000 metric tons of krill in coastal waters of the northern Antarctic Peninsula and island archipelagos of the Scotia Arc [ 8 ]. Throughout this region, breeding populations of Adélie ( Pygoscelis adeliae ), gentoo ( P . papua ), and chinstrap ( P . antarctica ) penguins and Antarctic fur seals ( Arctocephalus gazella ) forage on krill [ 9 – 11 ]. These four species, hereafter “predators”, are studied annually as part of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP). The CEMP, implemented in 1985, is a circumpolar research effort designed to detect changes in predator populations and distinguish between changes attributable to fisheries and environmental variation [ 12 ]. In particular, the CEMP includes measurements intended to provide information across a range of spatiotemporal scales, from short-term and local-scale impacts (i.e., assessments of foraging effort, diet, chick growth, and reproductive success during the breeding season) to longer-term and larger-scale impacts that integrate over the non-breeding period in habitats remote from local breeding areas (e.g., trends in population size and survival rates) [ 12 ].  The predators were chosen because they are central-place foragers (they must forage close to breeding colonies to provision their offspring on regular intervals) whose diets typically contain high proportions of Antarctic krill [ 9 – 11 ]. The restricted foraging space and dietary preference of these predators during the breeding season suggest that fishing activity near breeding colonies may have measurable impacts on the predators. For example, endangered African penguins exhibited a reduction in foraging effort [ 6 ] and an increase in chick survival [ 7 ] after a no-take marine protected area was established around their breeding colonies, demonstrating that predator performance can be sensitive to the spatial distribution of fishing. Similarly, the predators studied within the CEMP are considered useful indicators for developing fisheries management advice.  Despite the long tenure of the CEMP, however, parameterization of the functional responses of krill-dependent predators to variations in krill biomass and krill catches remains difficult [ 13 – 15 ]. This difficulty likely arises for myriad reasons, including: 1) massive inter-annual variations in krill standing stock due to recruitment [ 16 ], advection [ 17 ], and changes in krill assessment methodology [ 18 ]; 2) strong climate signals in predator reproductive performance and demography [ 19 , 20 ]; 3) oceanographic and bathymetric conditions that appear to aggregate krill locally [ 21 – 23 ]; and 4) temporary catch quotas intended to minimize local depletion of prey [ 24 ]. Additionally, the predators are highly mobile and often disperse widely throughout the Southern Ocean during the austral winter [ 25 – 27 ]. Such dependence on distant foraging habitats may dilute an assessment of local fishing impacts. Nonetheless, krill-dependent predators and the fishery ultimately have a functional overlap; both are dependent on krill. If predators and the fishery use the same population of krill, it follows that removal of krill by one group may limit availability to the other. In the absence of clear functional responses, other metrics of predator-fishery interactions may be useful for informing management decisions.  In systems with resource competition, actors typically minimize competition by partitioning their use of available resources in space and time [ 28 ]. Therefore, quantitative descriptions of spatiotemporal overlap between predators and the fishery provide an index of the risk of potential competition for a shared resource. Locations with high overlap might be considered locations where the risks of negative impacts by the fishery are highest. In the Scotia Sea, the extent of concurrent overlap between predator foraging areas and fishing locations is unknown, but potentially widespread throughout coastal regions [ 29 ], especially near breeding areas. Bycatches of penguins and seals in krill fishing nets are rare, but have been recorded [ 30 ], indicating that overlap can occur at the finest possible scale. We posit, however, that indices of overlap integrated over tens to hundreds of kilometers, and from daily to annual time steps, are relevant to decisions regarding the spatial and temporal distributions of catch.  The krill fishery in United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Statistical Area 48 is currently managed based on a biomass estimate from an acoustic survey of the Scotia Sea that was conducted in the year 2000 [ 31 ]. From this survey, a precautionary catch limit of 5.61 million tons was agreed in 2010 [ 32 ]. However, uncertainty regarding the risks to krill-dependent predators that could arise from a spatial concentration of catches has long been the chief concern of fisheries management for Antarctic krill. In 1991, the CCAMLR agreed to an arbitrary interim catch limit (known as the trigger level) of 620,000 tons [ 33 ]. This trigger level supersedes the precautionary catch limit until such time that a small-scale spatial allocation of catches above the trigger level can be agreed. Concerned that even catches of 620,000 tons, if concentrated sufficiently, could adversely impact predators, the CCAMLR further agreed to subdivide the trigger level among FAO Statistical Subareas 48.1 through 48.4 [ 24 ]. As such, the current catch limit in the Antarctic Peninsula region (Subarea 48.1) is set at an arbitrary 155,000 tons, representing roughly 2.75% of the precautionary catch limit. Thus, current catches are generally regarded as precautionary despite an obsolescing biomass estimate that was distributed primarily in open ocean areas outside the main fishing grounds [ 34 ].  Allowing an expansion of the catch up to the precautionary catch limit remains a long-term goal within CCAMLR [ 35 ]. Such an expansion will require advice on appropriate spatial allocations of the catch limit and the provision of such advice is an ongoing research focus of the CCAMLR and its working groups [ 4 , 34 ]. Given the relatively concentrated distribution of krill in the Scotia Sea [ 36 ] and a fishery that currently operates exclusively in the Scotia Sea [ 37 ], we assume that large increases of krill catch limits imply that existing fishing areas will experience increased fishing pressure. Thus, to identify areas where increased catches may present risk to krill-dependent predators, we assess here the contemporaneous activities of predators and fishing vessels to identify the mosaic of current spatial overlap. We suggest that identifying the areas of concurrent overlap provide information necessary to consider where the risks of increased catches may exist. For example, is risk only present near breeding aggregations or is risk more broadly distributed? We first analyze six years of telemetry data to describe broad patterns of predator movements during summer and winter seasons. We then estimate concurrent overlap of predators with recent fishing activity in time, space, and depth to determine the extent and locations of overlap. We note that these estimates of overlap are not intended to infer negative impacts of current catches on predators. Rather, we identify the multi-species mosaic of overlap with the fishery to identify areas where subsequent increases in catch may increase risks to predator performance.    Material and Methods   Ethics statement  All research on seabirds and mammals was permitted and conducted under appropriate Antarctic Conservation Act (Permits 2007–003, 2011–005, 2012–005) Marine Mammal Protection Act (Permits 774-1847-04, 16472–01), and approved animal care and use protocol (seabirds: University of California—San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee S05480; pinnipeds: National Marine Fisheries Service—Southwest/Pacific Islands Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 2011–02).    Study area and data sources  At-sea locations of penguins and fur seals were collected with archival and satellite telemetry tags during 2009 to 2014 from long-term research sites at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island (62.46°S, 60.79°W), and Admiralty Bay, King George Island (62.21°S, 58.42°W). Animals were tracked throughout the south Pacific and south Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean, but we focus our analysis of overlap within the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Statistical Subareas 48.1 and 48.2, roughly bounded by 70°W and 30°W longitude, and 70°S and 57°S latitude ( Fig 1 ). Data on krill densities and depth distributions were collected acoustically during scientific research cruises conducted by the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program (U.S. AMLR) in the austral summers of 2009–2011 (summer acoustic surveys were not conducted from 2012 to 2014) on an established research grid in waters surrounding the South Shetland Islands ( Fig 1 ). We used haul-by-haul fishing location and net depths recorded by krill fishing vessels that operated in the study area from 2009 to 2014. These fishery data were made available by CCAMLR. The telemetry data, acoustic survey data for krill, and penguin and fur seal abundance data used here are provided in the Supplemental Information ( S1 Data ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.g001  Fig 1   Map of study area, tagging locations (stars), and U.S. AMLR sampling stations (red dots).  Acoustic transects occur on the northbound or southbound transits between sampling stations. Boundaries of small-scale management units (SSMUs) are indicated by dashed lines.     The period 2009–2014 is representative of a recent shift in fishing operations to more southern areas during winter months that are coincident with the reduced presence of winter sea ice in the Bransfield Strait [ 38 ]. During the study period, the sympatric breeding aggregations of Adélie, chinstrap, and gentoo penguins exhibited changes in population size ( Table 1 ) that are mainly commensurate with population trends throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region [ 39 , 40 ]. One notable exception is the recent positive growth of the Adélie population in Admiralty Bay, though this recent increase must be placed in the context of long-term declines at the site [ 39 ]. Antarctic fur seals are only present at Cape Shirreff and represent the southernmost breeding population of this species. Outside of South Georgia, Cape Shirreff is the largest breeding aggregation of fur seals in the Scotia Arc [ 41 , 42 ]. Pup production at Cape Shirreff, a proxy for population size, declined during the study period ( Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.t001  Table 1  Instrument deployment and recent population change at each study site.

At-sea positions were estimated during all summer breeding periods, 2009–2014, on penguins with ARGOS tags. Location estimates during the pup-rearing period for fur seals were estimated with both ARGOS (2009–2010) and GPS (2009–2014) tags ( Table 1 ). We also used data collected with ARGOS tags from two overwinter studies of fur seals, chinstrap and gentoo penguins in 2010 and 2011 ( Table 1 ). Summer deployments provided location estimates whenever the tag was wet and for up to one hour after continuous dry conditions were recorded by on-board saltwater sensors. Winter deployments on penguins were duty cycled to provide position estimates for 12 hrs every third day. The ARGOS telemetry instruments used during these tracking studies included SPOT4 and SPOT5 satellite tags (Wildlife Computers, Inc. Redmond, WA, USA), and KiwiSat 101 satellite tags (Sirtrack, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand). The FastLoc © GPS tags were Mk10 tags (Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA, USA).  Depth data collected during foraging dives by chinstrap and gentoo penguins and fur seals were recorded with time-depth records (TDR) at Cape Shirreff ( Table 1 ). For penguins, foraging dives near breeding colonies were recorded at 1s intervals with Mk9 TDRs (Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA, USA) from January through February. Fur seal foraging dives over the first 6 foraging trips following parturition, occurring from early December into February, were recorded at 2s intervals using Mk10 TDRs (Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA, USA). The dive data were processed to identify maximum depths for each dive using Wildlife Computers Instrument Helper (Version 3.0). Only dives exceeding 5m in depth were included in our analysis. The 5m cutoff was used to remove porpoising during travel and is consistent with prior analyses for penguins [ 43 , 44 ]. The 5m cutoff is deeper than previously used cutoffs for fur seals (e.g. 2m [ 45 ]), but inspection of the data suggested that 5m was appropriate, and the estimates of mean maximum dive depths presented here are similar to those previously reported for Antarctic fur seals [ 45 , 46 ].  All telemetry instruments were attached directly to the back plumage or pelage using adhesives, either quick-drying epoxy or cyanoacrylate glue. For penguins, small plastic cable ties were threaded through underlying feathers and closed over the top of the tag as an additional fastener. Instruments were recovered from all animals that returned to the tagging locations after the summer or winter observation periods. In total, the instrument recovery rate for this study was roughly 75%.    Krill acoustics  Data on krill densities and depth distributions throughout the U.S. AMLR survey grid ( Fig 1 ) were derived from calibrated acoustic backscatter collected at three frequencies (38, 120, and 200 kHz). The backscatter data collected in the upper 15m of the water column were excluded from analysis due to surface noise. Backscatter data within each 10m depth bin from 15m to 250m and over each 1 nautical mile segment of the survey grid were processed to estimate krill density (g · m -2 ) using the three-frequency stochastic distorted-wave Born approximation (SDWBA) method [ 16 , 47 ] following standard protocols [ 18 ].    Spatial analysis  We note that raw satellite-based tracking data provide incomplete and often imprecise records of animal movement. We therefore used a state-space modeling approach to derive estimates of overlap with the fishery. Our approach, following the methods of Hinke et al. [ 27 ], allows for data-based interpolation of at-sea movements on regular time intervals to improve the characterization of activity at sea. Briefly, we first applied a speed filter [ 48 ] to eliminate positions that would require a sustained swimming speed of >2 m·s -1 for all species. We next fitted Bayesian state-space models [ 49 ] to the data from each deployment and interpolated positions on a 1 hr time step. We then sampled from the posterior distributions surrounding the best fitting tracks to generate 50 alternative track lines for each deployment (again with a temporal resolution of 1 hr). These alternative track lines explicitly account for uncertainty in the location estimates derived from animal-borne instruments [ 50 ] and provide distributions of likely positions from which overlap with the fishery can be inferred.  We examined the extent of spatial overlap by binning positions from the 50 alternative tracks representing each deployment on multiple spatial and temporal scales. For spatial scales, we used arbitrary grid sizes of x° longitude by x/2° latitude, where x was 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2. We also binned positions by small-scale management units (SSMU; Fig 1 , Table 2 ). The SSMUs represent proposed management units for the krill fishery [ 35 ]. Each SSMU varies in size ( Fig 1 , Table 2 ), but all are larger than our largest spatial grid cell. Likewise, we chose five temporal scales to assess overlap: daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal (two six-month periods from October–March (summer) and April–September (winter)), and annual. Note that the time scales were not used to identify when overlap occurred. Rather, the time scales represented the specific period over which the presence of the fishery and a predator in a particular spatial area would be considered concurrent. These spatial and temporal scales were chosen to range from the scale of a typical net tow by a fishing vessel or foraging trip of a penguin up to annual overlap on proposed fishery management units. For example, a 0.25° longitude by 0.125° latitude grid, equivalent to a 13 km by 14 km polygon at 62°S, is similar to the average maximum distances from tagging locations achieved during summer foraging trips by penguins (19.4 ± 9.75 km) and the average lengths of tows reported by fishing vessels (1.4 ± 0.6 hr, equivalent to 7.8 ± 3.5 km), assuming maximum towing speeds of 3 knots [ 51 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.t002  Table 2  Summary of small-scale management units (SSMU) and krill fishing data in the study area, 2009 to 2014.

We present these estimates of overlap in maps that highlight the locations and magnitudes of cumulative presence-presence overlap of instrumented predators and the krill fishery. We also calculated the proportion of cells where concurrent overlap occurred relative to the total number of grid cells occupied by the fishery only, the total number of cells occupied by the predators only, and the total number of cells occupied by both the fishery and the predators. In this way, the overlap results can be interpreted as simple percentages of each respective area used. Finally, we used the Schoener Index [ 52 ] to calculate a statistical index of overlap that accounts for both location of overlap and the frequency of concurrent presence of predators and prey in each spatial cell.    Overlap in depth  We examined overlap in depth distributions by fishery net hauls, mean maximum dive depths made by penguins and fur seals, and the vertical distributions of krill based on acoustic surveys conducted north of Livingston Island. Note that krill density data from acoustic surveys is only available during summers from 2009–2011. All data for this analysis were restricted to the months of January and February and restricted to positions within the boundary of the Antarctic Peninsula Drake Passage West (APDPW) SSMU. This spatial and temporal restriction provided, as close as possible, concurrent estimates of depth use by krill, predators, and the krill fishery in the same local geographic region. We assume that TDR dive locations for penguins occurred within the cluster of locations estimated independently by satellite tracking instruments deployed on different individuals from Cape Shirreff. For fur seals this assumption was not necessary because GPS location and dive data were collected concurrently with the same instrument.    Statistical reporting  Data summaries are reported as mean ± 1 standard deviation unless otherwise indicated.     Results   Temporal extents of fishing and tracking data  During the 6-year study period 7966 vessel-days of fishing were reported in the study area, including 1,380 unique days that accounted for roughly 63% of the study period ( Table 3 ). Raw predator tracking data, collected during 394 deployments, provided 11073 tag-days of data that represented 748 unique days ( Table 3 ). Roughly 80% of the available tracking data was concurrent, on a daily basis, with fishing activity in the study area. The average duration of each deployment on penguins during the breeding season lasted 1 to 2 weeks, while average winter deployments provided data for roughly 3 months ( Table 3 ). The average duration of deployments on fur seals was roughly 3 weeks during summer, while overwinter deployments provided data for more than 5 months ( Table 3 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.t003  Table 3  Summary of satellite telemetry deployments and temporal coverage of fishing activity during 2009–2014.  Average deployment duration and maximum distance from tagging locations were calculated from the entire data set. Total and unique days were calculated only for data within the study area (-70S to -57S and -70W to -30W). For the fishery, N is the total number of vessels across all years and the average deployment is the average time, in days, spent in the study area by each vessel.

During the summer breeding season, all predators foraged near their respective breeding locations, with mean maximum foraging ranges being largest for fur seals (97.4 ± 50.5 km) and smallest for gentoo penguins (15.6 ± 6.0 km at Cape Shirreff and 15.3 ± 11.5 km at Admiralty Bay; Table 3 ). During winter, fur seals and chinstraps exhibited long-distance movements into the South Pacific and South Atlantic. Fur seals radiated from Cape Shirreff to occupy a wide swath of habitats mainly north of 60°S, including remote, pelagic regions of the central South Pacific; waters surrounding southern South America, the Patagonian shelf, and South Georgia. Mean maximum great circle distances from Cape Shirreff were 2187 ± 1343 km and one female fur seal reached a maximum great circle distance of 4750 km from Cape Shirreff. Chinstrap penguins exhibited longitudinal migrations into habitats mainly south of 60°S through the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas as far west as 158°W (a great-circle distance of 4782 km from Cape Shirreff). Chinstrap penguins also moved as far east as 26°E (a great-circle distance of 1903 km from Cape Shirreff), near the South Sandwich Islands. Despite these long-distance movements, both fur seals and chinstrap penguins occupied areas throughout the Scotia Sea during winter ( Fig 2 ). Gentoo penguins also moved away from their breeding colonies during winter, but did not disperse as widely as chinstrap penguins or fur seals. In particular, gentoo penguins tagged at Cape Shirreff typically moved into the southwestern Bransfield Strait and occupied coastal areas along the Antarctic Peninsula during winter, with maximum distances from Cape Shirreff averaging 120 ± 82 km. Adélie penguins were not tracked during winter, but incubation shift and pre-molt movements ( Fig 2 ) are indicative of the winter movements undertaken by Adélie penguins that breed in Scotia Arc [ 24 , 25 ]. The seasonal patterns of movement through the Southern Ocean of all the tracked predators are animated in the Supplemental Information ( S1 Animation ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.g002  Fig 2   Spatial extent of tracking data from summer and winter deployments for each species.  Scales differ for some panels to highlight extent of available data. Overwinter data for fur seals and chinstrap penguins that fall within FAO Subareas 48.1 and 48.2 are highlighted in orange. Incubation shift and pre-molt trips for chinstrap and Adélie penguins are plotted together.       Overlap in space  Fishing was conducted in every SSMU in the study area, but predominantly west of the South Orkney Islands, in the Bransfield Strait, and over the shelf north of the South Shetland Islands ( Fig 3A ). The numbers of tows and total catches of krill were highest in the South Orkney Islands and within the Bransfield Strait ( Table 2 ). Similarly, raw predator tracking data from the two tagging sites were recorded in all SSMUs except in the SSMU southeast of the South Orkney Islands. In general, the combined spatial distribution of penguins and fur seals tended to be broader than that of the fishery. Despite wide coverage by the predators, we note that the predator location data are concentrated near tagging locations at Cape Shirreff and Admiralty Bay ( Fig 3B ). An animation depicting seasonal movements of all tracked predators and fishing vessels within Subareas 48.1 and 48.2 is provided in the Supplemental Information ( S2 Animation ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.g003  Fig 3   Spatial extent of krill fishing net hauls and raw ARGOS and GPS location estimates.  Data are binned to a 0.25° longitude x 0.125° latitude grid. Color scales represent the respective proportion of hauls and location estimates per grid cell.     There was concurrent spatial overlap of tracked predators and the fishery across the entire range of spatial and temporal scales considered here ( Fig 4 ). Frequent overlap was routinely observed in the vicinity of Cape Shirreff. However, even at the smallest temporal and spatial scales, overlap of tracked predators and the fishery occurred throughout areas north of South Shetland Islands, west of the South Orkney Island groups and within the Bransfield Strait from King George Island in the northeast to the area around Brabant Island and the Danco Coast in the southwest ( Fig 4A ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.g004  Fig 4   Accumulation of overlap for concurrent predator and fishery presence in a grid cell.  A) Spatial grid of 0.25° longitude x 0.125°latitude, temporal scale of 1 day. B) Spatial grid of 1° longitude x 0.5° latitude, temporal scale of 1 month. C) Spatial grid of SSMU, temporal scale of 1 year. Note that scale bars differ for each panel and axes for panel A differ from panels B and C.     The number of times overlap occurred in any grid cell was typically low. On a daily basis at the smallest spatiotemporal scale, the maximum overlap in any grid cell was 20 days, or roughly 3% of the days with concurrent predator and fishery data ( Fig 4A ). The frequency of overlap increased with the temporal and spatial scale considered such that maximum overlap occurred in 52% of the months on a 1° longitude x 0.5° latitude grid ( Fig 4B ) and 100% of the years ( Fig 4C ) on the SSMU scale.  As the spatiotemporal scale of our analysis increased, the proportion of grid cells where overlap occurred also increased ( Fig 5 ), but the increases occurred at different rates for each respective index of overlap. Overlap with respect to the area occupied by the fishery ( Fig 5A ) increased most rapidly at the smallest scales, with a mean overlap of 10% on the smallest spatiotemporal scale, 38% at the middle scale (1 month, 1° longitude), and up to 70% of the total fished area at the largest scales. The rapid increase in overlap of the fished area at smaller spatial and temporal scales indicates a relatively constrained distribution of the fishery within the concurrent foraging range of all tracked predators. Relative to the total area occupied by the predators at any one time ( Fig 5B ), the initial 10% overlap level observed for the fishery area was not achieved until scales larger than weekly and 0.5° longitude were considered and overlap was roughly 15% at the middle scale. Thereafter, overlap increased to near 90% at the largest spatiotemporal scale, indicating that the fished areas overlap almost all of the annual foraging ranges of predators tracked from just two breeding locales. Overlap in the area occupied by both predators and the fishery ( Fig 5C ) was similar to, but lower than, the pattern of overlap based on predator area alone. The Schoener index, which accounts for both co-occurrence in a grid cell and the proportional use of that area by predators and the fishery, respectively, exhibited a lower absolute level of overlap across all scales, but retained the general pattern of increasing overlap with increasing spatiotemporal scale ( Fig 5D ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.g005  Fig 5   Contours of overlap across space and time.  Contours represent the mean proportion of grid cells in which overlap occurs relative to total number of grid cells occupied by the A) fishery B) predators, and C) fishery and predators combined. The Schoener index is plotted in panel D. Spatial scales are identified as 0.25) 0.25° longitude x 0.125°latitude; 0.5) 0.5° longitude x 0.25°latitude; 1) 1.0° longitude x 0.5°latitude; 2) 2.0° longitude x 1.0°latitude.     Locations where overlap was identified throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region exhibited a mean summer krill density of 58.9 g·m -2 (median = 32.8 g·m -2 ; range = 0–385 g·m -2 ; Fig 6 ), which is similar to the background mean density of krill observed in U.S. AMLR surveys (mean = 60.6 g·m -2 ; median = 31.9 g·m -2 , range = 0–582 g·m -2 ) across three summers. It is notable that the area around Elephant Island exhibited, on average, the highest estimates of krill density during summer, but very little fishing effort was directed there during the study period ( Fig 3A ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.g006  Fig 6   Predator-fishery overlap and mean summer krill density in FAO Subarea 48.1.

Concurrent data from the krill fishery, acoustic research surveys, and predator tracking recorded during January and February 2009–2011 in the APDPW SSMU ( Fig 7 ) allowed an assessment of overlap in depth at the SSMU scale. Averaged across years, the mean depth distributions of krill exhibited strong diel patterns with significant shoaling and increased krill density in surface waters at night ( Fig 8 ). During daytime, maximum krill density of 6.6 ± 2.4 g·m -2 occurred at 50m ( Fig 8A ), while nighttime maximum densities of 15.5 ± 5.8 g·m -2 occurred at 40m. Krill density above 40m was routinely 2x higher during the night than during the day ( Fig 8B ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170132.g007  Fig 7   Drake Passage West SSMU acoustic transect, net tow, fur seal, chinstrap, and gentoo penguin locations.

Average maximum dive depths for predators and average net depth in the fishery for 2009–2012 are plotted at a magnified depth scale for day (C) and night (D) to better illustrate depth ranges; the depth of maximum krill density during day or night is marked with a solid horizontal line in panels A through D. Average maximum dive depth for predators and average net depth in the fishery for 2012 to 2014 are plotted for day time (E) and night time (F); for reference, the depth of maximum krill density from 2009–2012 (no krill density data are available for 2012–2014) is marked as a dashed horizontal line. Note that y-axes in panels C through F differ from panels A and B.     Depth use by predators tracked the diel distributions of krill. During daytime, which accounts for roughly 70% of the time during January and February at Cape Shirreff, the mean maximum depths used by fur seals (32.8 ± 2.2 m) and chinstrap penguins (30.7 ± 2.6 m) were similar, while gentoo penguins generally made deeper dives (51.6 ± 6.1 m; Fig 8C ). For all predators, mean maximum dive depths were at or just above the depths where krill density was highest ( Fig 8 ). Fishing depths during daytime averaged 40.9 ± 4.3 and fell between the mean maximum depths of the predators and the depth of maximum krill density. During night time, the mean maximum depths use by fur seals (26 ± 1.8 m), gentoo (31 ± 21.1 m) and chinstrap penguins (18.9 ± 3.7 m) shoaled, and were, on average, 13.0 ± 7.1 m shallower than daytime depths ( Fig 8D ). Fishing depths at night (40.2 ± 12.6 m) were similar to daytime fishing depths, and matched the depth of maximum krill density at night ( Fig 8B ). A similar pattern of depth use was observed for all predators from 2012 through 2014 ( Fig 8C and 8D ). The fishery used shallower net depths during day than either the predators or earlier fishing, but night time depth overlapped all depths used by all predators.     Discussion  We identified areas and depths with repeated, concurrent overlap of krill-dependent predators and the krill fishery throughout the southern Scotia Arc, particularly in the Bransfield Strait and north of the South Shetland Islands. At the smallest spatiotemporal scales, predator foraging overlapped directly with 12% of the contemporaneous fishing area and fishing overlapped with less than 10% of contemporaneous foraging areas. Though representing relatively small total areas, the small-scale overlaps form a conservative baseline that demonstrates how focal areas of the fishery are used by predators and vice versa. Furthermore, the predators and fishery routinely used similar depth ranges that matched the depths where krill densities were highest during day and night. The evidence for such broad-scale, concurrent overlap in space and depth, despite relatively small numbers of tracked individuals from only two breeding locations, highlights the potential for competitive interactions between predators and the krill fishery at relatively small spatial scales. These results are consistent with modeling work that demonstrates the krill fishery can pose risks to krill-dependent predators [ 4 , 53 ] and suggest that spatial allocations of catch that prevent concentration of fishing effort in any one area may be warranted.   Factors affecting overlap  In the Scotia Sea, sea-ice dynamics broadly define the suitability of fishing grounds. Krill-fishing locations change within and between years, driven by changing sea ice conditions that can alter access to preferred fishing grounds [ 37 ]. Historically, as winter advanced and sea ice covered southern areas, the fishery moved north and east from the Antarctic Peninsula region toward South Georgia. In recent years, reductions in sea ice extent in the Bransfield Strait during autumn and winter have allowed fishing vessels to remain in southern areas for longer periods of time [ 37 ], resulting in the concentration of effort and a large increase in catches taken from Subarea 48.1 relative to earlier decades [ 38 ]. Despite the strong dependence on sea ice for access to some fishing areas, however, it is notable that current management may be relatively more restrictive; catches near the 155,000 ton catch limit in Subarea 48.1 have been reached in 4 of the last 6 years [ 8 ], prompting closure of the fishery despite conditions that remained favorable to continued fishing operations. As climate change is expected to further reduce the duration of the sea-ice season in the Antarctic Peninsula region [ 54 ], longer fishing seasons may be expected.  The extent of spatial overlap we observed was also limited by available tracking data. Our data derive mostly from summer deployments on breeding animals with relatively restricted foraging ranges at two monitoring sites in the South Shetland Islands. Thus, our estimates of overlap with the fishery, while representative of the tracked population, under-represent true overlap given numerous other breeding locations of krill dependent penguins throughout the Scotia Arc [ 40 ], untracked demographic groups (e.g., male Antarctic fur seals and juvenile penguins), and the proximity of fishing activity to coastal areas. It is important to note that increasing sample sizes from our study sites may not greatly increase estimates of overlap. Individuals from breeding colonies often exhibit preference for particular, local foraging areas [ 55 ] potentially as a means to minimize inter- and intra-specific competition with neighboring populations of central place foragers. While adding more individuals from our tagging sites may increase the frequency of overlap in some grid cells, it is less certain that new areas of overlap would be identified. However, tracking individuals from neighboring colonies throughout the Antarctic Peninsula region or different demographic groups would almost certainly identify more areas of overlap. For example, predator-specific overlap with the fishery differs by species ( S1 Appendix ), owing to different foraging habitat preferences throughout the year (e.g., Fig 2 ). However, combining those species-specific overlap maps builds the mosaic of overlap that increases the frequency of overlap in certain places and expands the total area of overlap in general. Additionally, male fur seals are known to occur in the vicinity of the South Shetland Islands throughout the winter [ 56 ] and tracking data from geolocators suggests Adélie penguins may forage extensively in areas around the South Orkney Islands during winter [ 27 ]. Thus, the spatial extent of overlap observed from our two study colonies, particularly at the smallest spatiotemporal scale, was unexpected.  At the broad scale, the risks to predators in areas of overlap may also be sensitive to movement of krill, whereby variability in the supply of krill from upstream areas dictates the risk of fishing in downstream areas [ 57 , 58 ]. At finer spatial scales however, heterogeneity in circulation that can arise from interactions between complex bathymetry and time-varying flows may interact with krill behavior (e.g., diel vertical migration), altering the residence time of krill within specific areas relative to the background flux of krill [ 59 , 60 ]. In such areas, a process of continuous replenishment may misrepresent true dynamics. For example, preliminary analysis of small-scale surface currents from drifter data and circulation modeling (Reiss, unpublished manuscript) suggest that areas with concurrent predator-fishery overlap in the southern Bransfield Strait are characterized by relatively low flows. While large-scale flux is critical for transport of krill from spawning areas in the western Antarctic Peninsula to the eastern Scotia Sea [ 57 , 58 ], the small scale rates of import and export, and hence any putative benefits of replenishment, in areas of overlap identified here remain unresolved.    Areas of important overlap  Three general locations of overlap occurred in coastal waters near each tagging location, to the west of the South Orkney Islands, and in the southwestern Bransfield Strait warrant further discussion. The density of data from tagged animals was greatest near the summer breeding colonies of our study animals ( Fig 2B ). Thus, we expected higher overlap to occur in the vicinity of Cape Shirreff and Admiralty Bay. Indeed, high rates of overlap occurred along the northern shore of Livingston Island and at the mouth of Admiralty Bay ( Fig 4A ). Fishing activity in the SSMUs adjacent to each tagging site was among the highest in the study region, representing 14.4% of tows and 14.5% of total catch in the Antarctic Peninsula Bransfield Strait East (APBSE) and 9% of all tows and 6.7% of the total catch in the Antarctic Peninsula Drake Passage East (APDPW) during the study period ( Table 3 ). The observed overlap reaffirms prior work to define SSMUs based on likely foraging ranges of penguins and seals [ 61 ].  Overlap observed near the South Orkney Islands and in the southwestern Bransfield Strait reveals that potential direct competition for krill between the krill fishery and predators is not limited to local foraging habitats near breeding areas during the summer. Rather, direct predator-fishery interactions may be widespread and occur during winter when predators are distributed more widely. Foraging conditions encountered during winter are considered key drivers of recruitment and overwinter survival in the Antarctic Peninsula region [ 62 ]. The extent of concurrent overlap with fisheries in over-wintering habitats provides a mechanism, namely competition, by which predator survival may be further impacted.  The South Orkney West (SOW) and Bransfield Strait West SSMUs experienced the greatest amount of effort by the fishery during the study period ( Table 2 ), accounting for roughly 63% of total net tows and 68% of total catch combined. In both areas, fishing effort occurred throughout the SSMUs, but there were clear concentrations of effort in relatively small areas within each SSMU. The concentration of effort may indicate the presence of predictable aggregations of krill; such aggregations would likely be important foraging areas for predators [ 23 ]. With respect to predators in these regions, the confluence of the Scotia and Weddell Seas for Adélie and chinstrap penguins has been documented with tracking data during winter [ 27 ] and here we show that concurrent overlap with the fishery also occurred in this general area. These locations near the South Orkney Islands are either focal foraging areas during the non-breeding season (e.g., for Adélie penguins, [ 27 ]) or stopovers along migratory corridors (e.g., for chinstrap penguins [ 25 , 27 ] and fur seals [ 63 ]) between the Antarctic Peninsula and the eastern Scotia Sea.  In the Bransfield Strait, there is evidence from acoustic surveys to further support the argument that predictable aggregations of prey are critical for predators. First, overlap in the Bransfield Strait was highest where mean density of krill was greatest (>150g·m -2 , Fig 6 ). Furthermore, unpublished data from the U.S. AMLR program suggests that estimates of krill density throughout the Bransfield Strait during winter are higher relative to other locations and seasons around the South Shetland Islands. Predators are known to concentrate foraging effort in such “hotspots” in the Antarctic Peninsula region [ 64 ], and the southwestern Bransfield Strait is a key foraging habitat during the non-breeding period for numerous seabirds and marine mammals [ 64 – 65 ]. Given that the background dynamic of sea ice advance and retreat can affect the ability of predators and the fishery to access such hotspots, it is likely that such predictable locations of krill aggregations promote the occurrence of overlap when environmental conditions permit access by the fishery. While the frequency of overlap in these more distant areas was low, the observation of concurrent presence of predators from only two sites and the fishery nonetheless highlights the importance of such small areas within SSMUs for both predators and the fishery.  Finally, the depth distributions of predators and the krill fishery overlapped in the vicinity of Cape Shirreff. Predators tracked the vertical diel migration of krill more closely than the fishery, but the data suggest that all predators and the fishery focused effort on depths where krill density was highest during both day and night. We caution that the comparison of depth use is based on multi-year averages and does not represent concurrent use of vertical habitat. Nevertheless, breeding locations of central place forages may be determined, in part, by proximity to predictable aggregations of prey [ 21 ]. If so, then average depth use may provide an integrated estimate of critical foraging habitat. The data suggest that separation between predators during the day was marginally greater (13 ± 10 m) than during night (8.1 ± 3.7 m), consistent with expectations of niche partitioning among predators with similar dietary preferences. In particular, greater krill density throughout the upper 50m of the water column during night may relax competitive conditions among predators and allow greater overlap in depth use. Against this backdrop of depth use by the predators, it is notable that average fishing depths fall directly within the range used by the predators. The shared use of depths with high krill densities by predators and the fishery further support the argument that predators and fisheries compete for krill.    Implications for EBFM of the krill fishery and beyond  Ecosystem-based fisheries management of fisheries that target forage species, like krill, involves the management of risks to the prey resource, predators, and the marine ecosystem in general [ 4 ]. Resolving trade-offs between the acceptable risks to prey, predators, and fisheries is a general challenge for implementation of EBFM. Within the CCAMLR, the concept of the SSMU was an important step toward managing such risks by erecting discrete management units with potentially distinct catch allocations intended to limit the risk of negative impacts of localized fishing on krill-dependent predators. This step may, however, be insufficient; ecosystem modeling work has demonstrated that simply distributing krill catches among SSMUs may not be without risk to dependent predators [ 4 , 53 ]. Furthermore, our results indicate that direct interactions between predators and fisheries are common at scales smaller than SSMUs. This suggests that allocations of krill catches in the Scotia Sea should consider how to minimize the concentration of fishing effort within SSMUs, particularly if localized fishing overlaps with the foraging ranges of predators. Such spatial limitations on catch are, however, not without risk to performance of the fishery [ 4 , 53 ].  More generally, while a consensus view is emerging that a relatively large percentage of prey biomass be reserved (i.e. not caught by fisheries) to meet predator demands, e.g., about 33% of standing biomass [ 66 ] or 40% of pre-exploitation biomass [ 2 ], our results suggest that equal consideration should be given to the spatial distribution of catch limits. Spatial heterogeneity in prey distributions, predator foraging areas, and fishery operations imply that direct interactions of the prey-predator-fishery system often may be localized relative to the larger marine ecosystem being managed. For example, prey density in marine systems may be enhanced by local aggregative mechanisms, whether oceanographic or bathymetric; such areas are likely to be favored by predators and fisheries. This is supported by our maps of overlap, which identified areas where concurrent occupation by predator and fisheries occurred repeatedly over time. A concentration of fishing effort in such localized areas may negatively impact predators, particularly central-place foragers like numerous breeding seabird and pinniped species [ 2 , 3 , 67 , 68 ]. To mitigate potential negative effects of fisheries on predators in critical foraging areas, it thus seems necessary to specify not only relatively low harvest rates for forage fish fisheries, but to identify areas where the risk to predators may be greatest and implement management measures that account for high-risk areas. Such information, as presented in simple overlap maps, can advance EBFM efforts by directly including predator-derived indices in a risk-assessment framework.     Conclusions  Telemetry data provide a clear window into the essential foraging habitats used by marine predators. Identification of these foraging habitats and assessment of their overlap with fisheries that target prey therein can be useful for developing advice on the spatial distributions of catch. Our estimates of overlap identify the northern shelf of the South Shetland Islands and the Bransfield Strait as important areas for both the krill fishery and krill-dependent predators tracked from two field sites in the South Shetland Islands. As the krill fishery continues to develop around the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula and the CCAMLR’s effort to implement ecosystem-based management matures, we argue that indices of concurrent overlap estimated at small spatiotemporal scales may provide a useful metric for indicating where the risks of fishing are highest. A precautionary approach to allocating krill catches in space would be to avoid large increases in catch where overlap on small spatiotemporal scales is common.

We determined 12 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 19 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) congeners in eight different brands of commercial whole milk (WM) and fat free milk (FFM) produced and distributed in California. Congeners were extracted using a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method, purified by gel permeation chromatography, and quantified using gas chromatography-triple quadruple mass spectrometry. PBDEs and PCBs were detected in all FFM and WM samples. The most prevalent PBDE congeners in WM were BDE-47 (geometric mean: 18.0 pg/mL, 0.51 ng/g lipid), BDE-99 (geometric mean: 9.9 pg/mL, 0.28 ng/g lipid), and BDE-49 (geometric mean: 6.0 pg/mL, 0.17 ng/g lipid). The dominant PCB congeners in WM were PCB-101(geometric mean: 23.6 pg/mL, 0.67 ng/g lipid), PCB-118 (geometric mean: 25.2 pg/mL, 0.72 ng/g lipid), and PCB-138 (geometric mean: 25.3 pg/mL, 0.72 ng/g lipid). The sum of all 19 PCB congeners in FFM and WM were several orders of magnitude below the U.S. FDA tolerance. The sum of PBDEs in milk samples suggest close proximity to industrial emissions, and confirm previous findings of elevated PBDE levels in California compared to other regions in the United States.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066  National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences    P01ES011269   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6765-5085  Birgit Puschner        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000139  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency    8354320   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6765-5085  Birgit Puschner        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066  National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences    1R01ES020392      http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066  National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences    2R01ES014901      http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066  National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences    P42ES04699   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6765-5085  Birgit Puschner       UC Davis MIND Institute    Yanping Lin        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000139  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency    R829388   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6765-5085  Birgit Puschner        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000139  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency    R833292   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6765-5085  Birgit Puschner     This study is supported by the Center for Children's Environmental Health funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS P01ES011269) and US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA R829388, R833292 and 8354320) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program.

However, exposure to potentially deleterious compounds through milk and dairy products must be considered as an important public health issue. Commercial cow milk is a source for exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). PCBs and PBDEs are two groups of contaminants of particular concern because both are endocrine disruptors and neurotoxicants that persist and bioaccumulate due to their inherent high lipophilicity (log K ow values range from 3 to 9). The chemical families of PBDEs and PCBs each consist of 209 congeners, many of which have been detected in human samples [ 1 ], raising concerns about their impacts on human health. Beginning in the 1920s PCBs were widely used as electrical insulators in transformers, capacitors, and heat exchangers, and as stabilizers in paints, plastics, and rubber products [ 2 , 3 ]. PCBs were manufactured as mixtures of various congeners through progressive chlorination until a certain target percentage of chlorine by weight was achieved. In the U.S., these mixtures were referred to as Aroclors. The U.S. banned commercial PCB production in 1979. Major production of PBDEs began in the early 1970s for use as flame retardants in electronics, home furnishings, and foam products, including pet toys and bedding [ 4 ]. PBDE mixtures were produced commercially at three different levels of bromination, leading to the terms penta-, octa- and deca-BDEs. BDE-99, BDE-47, BDE-100, BDE-153 and BDE-154 are most commonly added to polyurethane foam used for furniture cushions as commercial penta-BDEs mixtures. Octa-BDEs are used in the plastic housing for televisions, computers and other electronics, and are composed of 70–80% of hepta- and octa-BDEs. Deca-BDEs, mainly containing BDE-209, are also added to high-impact plastic housing for electronic equipment, plastic furniture and plastic toys.[ 5 ]. In 2004, two commercial formulations, penta-BDE and octa-BDE, were banned or phased out of production in some U.S. states after a voluntary agreement between the U.S. EPA and the sole manufacturer of these products [ 6 ]. California, who was the first state to phase out penta- and octa-BDEs, banned production, processing and distribution of products containing more than 10 percent penta- or octa-BDEs through California Assembly Bill 302, which became effective January 2008. The bill exempts deca-BDEs and does not require labeling of PBDE-containing products [ 7 ].  PBDEs and PCBs are known to have adverse effects on the nervous and endocrine systems [ 8 ]. Attention has been directed toward ortho-poor PCB congeners (i.e., tetra- through octachlorobiphenyls with single or no ortho-chlorine atoms) because they can assume a coplanar configuration and interact with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), mimicking the action of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD), despite generally low environmental occurrences [ 9 – 11 ]. Endocrine effects of the ortho-rich PCBs (congeners with 2–4 ortho-chlorine atoms) include weak estrogenicity, disruption of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis, enhanced insulin secretion, and increased release of arachidonic acid [ 12 – 15 ]. Mechanistic studies of ortho-substituted PCB congeners have implicated these chemicals in neurotoxic responses [ 16 – 18 ]. Animal studies have demonstrated developmental neurotoxicity and alteration of thyroid hormone homeostasis after exposure to penta-BDEs, which consist of tetra- to hexa-congeners [ 19 , 20 ]. In particular, rats and rabbits had decreased body weight, reduced ossification of bones, and morphological changes in liver and kidneys [ 20 ]. Deca-BDE mixtures (octa-to deca-BDEs) have low acute toxicity and are not known to be mutagenic or carcinogenic. The different toxicities of penta-, octa- and deca-BDEs can be, in part, attributed to differences in toxicokinetics, because higher brominated BDEs like deca-BDEs partition to a larger degree into adipose tissue and have lower rates of metabolism and elimination compared to penta- or octa-BDEs [ 19 ]. In vitro studies have shown differences in biotransformation between BDE-47 and BDE-99 using human liver microsomes [ 21 , 22 ]. Animal studies have shown that highly brominated PBDE congeners, such as deca-BDEs, can be de-brominated and metabolized to lower brominated congeners [ 23 – 25 ] leading to increased levels of lower brominated BDE congeners in vivo . This is also illustrated by the observation that higher brominated PBDEs have shorter biological half-lives [ 26 ]. While there are no data on metabolism of PBDEs in bovine, BDE-99 has been shown to be de-brominated to BDE-49 in Chinook Salmon[ 27 ]. BDE-99 was also shown to be more extensively metabolized than BDE-47 in rats[ 28 ]. It is well established that biotransformation pathways are influenced by many biological factors, including species, age, hormone status, pregnancy, preexisting health conditions, and genetic polymorphisms[ 29 ].  California produces about 20.9% of the total milk in the United States, designating it the top dairy state in the U.S. While studies have been conducted in various countries in recent years to evaluate the concentrations of PBDEs and PCBs in milk and dairy products [ 30 – 33 ], very few such data exist for the U.S. [ 34 ], and no U.S. state-specific data have been established. Assessing the concentrations of PBDEs and PCBs in milk and dairy products from California is a much needed study. Soil, silage, hay and pasture can become polluted by PCB and PBDE contaminated sewage sludge run off from waste water treatment plants, older coatings of silos and air-soil deposition from industrial emissions [ 35 – 37 ]. Fugacity models depicting vegetation-to-milk, air-to-grass, and grass silage-to-lactating dairy cow transfer rates have shown that contaminated feed represents the greatest source for PCBs and PBDEs in lactating cows, while transfer via air and water is almost negligible [ 38 ]. Once absorbed, PCBs and PBDEs are rapidly distributed to tissues and milk. In fact, secretion of lipophilic compounds into milk is a major pathway for elimination and is influenced by the animal’s sex, age and physiological state of production [ 39 , 40 ].  We determined PCB and PBDE concentrations in store-bought bovine milk distributed by eight commercial producers in the state of California. Based on the proportions in commercial mixtures and toxicity data, we selected and quantified 19 PCB congeners including indicator PCBs 101, 138, 153 and 180 [ 41 ] and 12 PBDE congeners, mainly penta- and octa- BDEs. The region-specific evaluation of PCBs and PBDEs in cows’ milk is critical for identifying potential non-point sources and for establishing mitigation strategies for these persistent, organic pollutants in important food sources.    Materials and Methods   Sampling  Approximately 946 mL (one quart) of commercial bovine whole milk (WM) and fat free milk (FFM) samples from eight different brands were collected from high-delivery rate supermarkets in the Sacramento region between the months of August and September 2014. Each brand was selected based on whether the source and production of the milk originated from Californian farms. Of the eight brands, three were labelled as “organic”, while five brands were considered “conventional” milk. Geographic coordinates where milk samples were purchased are listed in S1 Table . Purchased milk was processed in the laboratory within one hour of purchase.    Chemicals and reagents  Hexane, acetone, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride and isooctane (analytical grade), anhydrous magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Ultrapure water (>18mΩ) was supplied by a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The following analytical standards of PCBs were purchased from AccuStandard Inc. (New Haven, CT, USA): 3,3’-dichlorobiphenyl (PCB-11); 3,3,4,4’-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB-77); 2,2’,3,3’,6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-84); 2,2’,3,4’,6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-91); 2,2’,3,5’,6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-95); 2,2’,4,5,5’-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-101); 2,3’,4,4’,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-118); 2,2’,3,3’,4,6-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-131); 2,2’,3,3’,4,6’-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-132); 2,2’,3,3’,5,6’-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-135); 2,2’,3,3’,6,6’-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-136); 2,2’,3,4,4’,5’-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB138); 2,2’,3,4’,5’,6’,-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-149); 2,2’,4,4’,5,5’-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153); 2,2’,3,3’,4,5,6’-heptachlorobiphenyl (PCB-174), 2,2’,3,3’,4,5’,6-heptachlorobiphenyl (PCB-175); 2,2’,3,3’,4,6,6’- heptachlorobiphenyl (PCB-176); 2,2’,3,4,4’,5,5’-heptachlorobiphenyl (PCB-180); 2,2’,3,3’,4,4’,5,6’-octachlorobiphenyl (PCB-196). The following analytical standards of PBDEs were purchased from AccuStandard Inc.: 2,2’,4-tribromodiphenyl ether (BDE-17); 2,4,4’-tribromodiphenyl ether (BDE-28); 2,2’,4,4’-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47); 2,2’,4,5’-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-49); 2,3’,4,4’-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-66); 2,2’,3,4,4’-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-85); 2,2’,3,5’,6-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-95); 2,2’,4,4’,5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99); 2,2’,4,5,5’-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-100); 2,2’,4,4’,5,5’-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-153); 2,2’,4,4’,5,6’-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-154); 2,2’,3,4,4’,5’,6-heptabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-183). The 13 C 12 -labeled surrogate internal standards 13 C 12 -2,2’,3,4’,5-pentachlorobiphenyl ( 13 C 12 -PCB-97) and 13 C 12 -2,3’,4,4’,5-pentabromobiphenyl ether ( 13 C 12 -BDE-118) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA, USA). Mirex (Sigma-Aldrich Corp, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as the secondary internal standard to assess instrument accuracy and bias.    Sample extraction and clean-up  All samples were extracted by a modified version of the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method [ 42 – 44 ]. Each container of milk was brought to room temperature and homogenized by shaking before opening. A 5mL aliquot of milk was placed into a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube and spiked with 10 μL of 100 ng/mL of internal standard. The sample was diluted with 5 mL of ultrapure water and extracted with 10 mL of hexane:acetone (1:1, v/v). Four grams of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and 1 g of sodium chloride were added to the mixture and the mixture was shaken for approximately 5 minutes using a platform shaker at 175 rpm. The sample was then centrifuged at 1606 xg for 5 minutes. The upper organic layer (~10mL) was transferred to a clean disposable glass tube and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40°C. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used for clean-up. The extract was reconstituted in 5 mL of hexane:ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v), then filtered through a 0.45 μ m PTFE Acrodisc CR filter (Pall Corporation, CA, USA) and loaded onto the GPC (J2 Scientific, Columbia, MO, USA). The GPC column (700mm) was packed with 40 g of SX-3 biobeads (40–80 μ m) with 200–400 mesh size and a molecular weight (MW) exclusion limit of 14,000 (Bio-Rad Corporation, Hercules, CA, USA). With a flow rate of 5 ml/min, eluate was collected during 13.30–43.3 min in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40°C. The residue was resolved in 100 μ L of isooctane prior to gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) analysis.    GC-MS/MS analysis  The final sample extracts were analyzed for PCB and PBDE congeners using a Bruker Scion TQ triple quadruple mass spectrometer equipped with a Bruker 451 GC and CP 8400 autosampler (Bruker, Fremont, CA, USA). A BR-5MS column (15m×0.25 mm i.d×0.25 μ m) was used as the stationary phase. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.8 mL/min. The source and transfer line temperatures were set at 250°C and 280°C, respectively. The GC oven temperature gradient was as follows: 1) started at 90°C and held for 1 minute; 2) increased to 150°C at a rate of 50°C/min and held for 1 minute; 3) increased to 310°C at a rate of 8°C/min and held for 3 minutes. The MS/MS was operating in electron ionization (EI) positive mode at 70 eV. Two μ L of extract were injected by pulsed splitless mode (split ratio of 50:1, 50 psi, 0.2 min) at 250°C. The individual PCB and PBDE analytes were quantified using the sum of two multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) transitions and characterized by their abundance ratios [ 45 ].    Quality control  To check the credibility of the data in the quantitative analyses, analytical validation of the method was performed. The factors considered in the validation included linearity, recovery, precision (relative standard deviation), accuracy, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). Individual standard solutions of each PBDE (BDE-17, 28, 47, 49, 66, 85, 95, 99, 100, 153, 154, and 183) and PCB (PCB-11, 77, 84, 91, 95, 101, 118, 131, 132, 135, 136, 138, 149, 153, 174, 175, 176, 180 and 196) congener were combined to prepare a mixed standard solution. A calibration curve was constructed (for analysis of diluted whole milk (1:9 dilution with pure water, v/v) fortified by the addition of the mixed standard solution of PBDE and PCB congeners, at levels of 2, 4, 8, 20, 40, 80, and 200 pg/ml, respectively. Fortified standard curve samples were subjected to the same extraction and clean-up procedure as described above. To determine accuracy of the method, a recovery study was performed using whole milk or fat free milk fortified with PBDE and PCB analytical reference standards at three concentrations of 4, 20 and 80 pg/mL. The spiked milk samples were subjected to the same extraction and clean-up procedure as described above. Percentages of recoveries of each congener were determined in triplicate at each concentration. The average recovery (n = 9, 3 concentration levels × 3 biological replicates) and the relative standard deviation (RSD = standard deviation / average) are presented in S3 Table . The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were defined based on signal-to-noise ratio exceeding three and ten, respectively. Values found below the LOD were reported as “non-detected” (ND) and, for statistical purposes, were assigned a value of half the LOD.    Lipids determination  Fat content of FFM and WM was determined by infrared (IR) spectroscopy following established standard operating procedures by the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory, Milk Quality Section, San Bernardino, CA [ 46 ].    Data analysis  The GC-MS/MS data was processed by Bruker Mass Spectrometry Working Station version 8.1 (Bruker, Fremont, CA, USA). The peak areas were used for quantification following an internal algorithm. Statistical analysis from the obtained data such as detection frequency, geometric mean (GM), geometric standard deviation (GSD), and median was done using Minitab version 17 software (Kivuto Solutions Inc. Ottawa, ON, Canada). Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was conducted to compare the differences between FFM and WM. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.     Results and Discussion  We found detectable levels of PCBs and PBDEs in all eight brands of commercially available bovine milk samples purchased in California with LODs ranging 0.3–5.8 pg/mL and 0.2–3.5 pg/mL for PCBs and PBDEs, respectively as listed in Tables 1 and 2 . The targeted PCB and PBDE congeners’ detection frequency was above 50%. The sample preparation method produced recoveries for PCBs and PBDEs of 66%-116.8% and 66%-117.6% from fat free milk (FFM), and 74.3%-120.3%and 74.8%-117.7% from whole milk (WM), respectively ( S3 Table ). The lipid corrected concentrations of PBDEs and PCBs in FFM and WM are presented in Table 3 . Due to low fat content, the lipid adjusted concentrations of PBDE and PCBs in FFM were much higher than those in WM.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170129.t001  Table 1  The limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), detection frequency (DF) and geometric mean (GM), geometric standard deviation (GSD) and median concentrations (pg/mL) of analyzed PCBs in eight brands of bovine milk samples analyzed in triplicate.

PCB-138 (GM: 25.7 and 25.3 pg/mL for FFM and WM), PCB-101 (GM: 28.9 and 23.6 pg/mL for FFM and WM) and PCB-118 (GM: 22.4 and 25.2 pg/mL for FFM and WM) were the top three contributors among all analyzed PCBs. BDE-47 (GM: 14.9 and 18.0 pg/mL for FFM and WM), BDE-99 (median: 8.1 and 9.9 pg/mL for FFM and WM) and BDE-49 (GM: 4.0 and 6.0 pg/mL for FFM and WM) were the top three dominant PBDE congeners among all analyzed PBDEs ( Table 2 ). ∑PBDEs and ∑PCBs were slightly higher in WM (∑PBDEs and ∑PCBs GM: 65.7 and 189.9 pg/mL, respectively) compared to FFM (∑PBDEs and ∑PCBs GM: 55.3 and 179.9 pg/mL, respectively). The differences were not statistically significant ( Fig 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170129.g001  Fig 1   The concentrations of ∑PBDEs and ∑PCBs in fat free milk and whole milk.  Data shown are the geometric mean (pg/mL) with geometric standard deviation, of eight brands of milk samples analyzed in triplicate (fat free milk n = 24, whole milk n = 23).     The concentrations of ∑PCBs and ∑PBDEs in individual brands varied between FFM and WM ( Fig 2 ). For most brands, ∑PBDEs and ∑PCBs were higher in WM than FFM. However, the ∑PBDEs of brand #3, 5, 8 were higher in FFM (GM of brands# 3, 5, 8: 69.4, 59.8 and 90.9 pg/mL) compared to WM (GM of brand # 3, 5, 8: 61.7, 49.4, and 35.1 pg/mL). In addition, ∑PCBs of brand # 7, 8 were higher in FFM (GM of brand # 7, 8: 287.8 and 287.9 pg/mL) compared to WM (GM of brand # 7, 8: 259.6 and 180.7 pg/mL). None of the differences between FFM and WM in the eight brands were statistically significant. As shown in Fig 3 , the ∑PBDEs in organic FFM (GM: 56.6 pg/mL) was slightly lower compared to organic WM (GM: 57.5 pg/mL). In contrast, ∑PCBs in organic FFM (GM: 330.2 pg/mL) was higher compared to that in organic WM (GM: 179.8 pg/mL). For conventional milk (brands #1, 2, 6, 7, 8), ∑PCBs and ∑PBDEs were lower in FFM (GM: 124.9 pg/mL and 54.6 pg/mL for PCBs and PBDEs, respectively) compared to WM (GM: 195.4 pg/mL and 70.5 pg/mL for PCBs and PBDEs).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170129.g002  Fig 2   The concentrations of ∑PBDEs and ∑PCBs with the relative amount of chlorination and bromination.

(A) Concentrations based on milk volume (pg/mL). (B) Concentrations based on milk lipid (ng/g lipid). Data shown are the geometric mean with geometric standard deviation of each brand of milk sample analyzed in triplicate (n = 9 for organic brands FFM, n = 8 for organic brands WM, and n = 15 for conventional brands FFM and WM).      PCB concentrations compared to the FDA tolerance and other studies  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tolerance for PCBs in fluid milk is 1.5 μg/g based on milk fat ( http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=109.30 ). Because PCBs and PBDEs are lipophilic, we report PCB and PBDE concentrations based on milk volume (mL) basis (pg/mL) and fat content basis (ng/g lipid). The geometric mean concentrations of lipid-adjusted ∑PCBs in WM and FFM samples were 5.4 and 124.7 ng/g respectively, which are both several orders of magnitude below the U.S. FDA tolerance of 1.5 μg/g milk fat. However, it is important to note that our data is comprised of only 19 PCB congeners. The concentrations of ∑PCBs found in WM (GM: 189.9 pg/mL) and FFM (GM: 179.9 pg/mL) in our samples were higher compared to data generated from a 2000/2001 U.S. survey which reported 14.1 pg/mL as the sum of PCB-77, -118, -105, -126, -156, -157, and -169, identifying PCB-118 and -105 as the major contributors [ 34 ]. The study by Schaum et al. evaluated geographical differences and identified that ∑PCBs tend to be lower in the West Central region compared to the Far West and Mid-Atlantic regions [ 34 ]. Our samples were collected from the Far West region when applying the geographic division approach used in that study. When comparing the geometric means of PCB-77 and -118 of 1.1 pg/mL and 25.2 pg/mL in WM and 1.2 pg/mL and 22.4 pg/mL in FFM to the 2003 national average for unprocessed milk collected from contributing dairies of 0.0711 pg/mL (PCB-77) and 9.64 pg/mL (PCB-118), our results are higher. The levels and % contribution of individual congeners to total PCBs vary between studies and countries. In our study, PCB-138 was found in highest concentrations (GM: 25.3 pg/mL), followed by -118 (GM: 25.2 pg/mL), -101 (GM: 23.6 pg/mL), -11 (GM: 21.0 pg/mL), and -149 (GM: 9.1 pg/mL) in WM. This congener pattern differs from that seen in other studies from European countries, including Finland, the UK, and Spain [ 47 – 49 ], African countries (Ghana and South Africa) [ 50 , 51 ], and Mexico. In those studies, PCB-153 and -138 were the most dominant congeners. There are known seasonal effects on PCB levels in bovine milk because of a washing effect subsequent to rainy conditions on PCB levels in soil and forage [ 52 ]. In addition, feeding practices for dairy cows vary widely between countries and regions with possible impact on different level and congener pattern exposure to PCBs. Another important factor that influences levels and congener patterns of PCBs in milk is days in lactation [ 53 ].  Interestingly PCB-11, known to be absent in the production of commercial PCB products, was detected above the LOQ in all milk samples and accounted for 5% and 11% of ∑PCBs in FFM and WM (according to the GM), respectively. PCB-11 is identified as a marker of non-legacy PCB contamination, and has been traced back to paint manufacturing facilities. Specifically, PCB-11 is produced in the production of diarylide yellow pigments [ 54 , 55 ], and not considered a metabolite of historical PCB mixtures. It has been found in polar region air samples, urban and rural environments in the US, and in Great Lakes Sediment [ 54 , 56 – 58 ]. Dairy feeds can be contaminated through sewage sludge, coatings of silos, air-soil deposition from industrial emissions, and run-off from wastewater treatment plants. In addition, husbandry of cattle can expose them to painted fences, barns and hutches, and corral pipes and subsequent exposure to paints and pigments are potential sources for exposure to non-legacy PCBs, such as PCB-11. Our findings highlight the recent recognition that unintentional by-product PCBs need to be monitored more rigorously to better understand their contribution to overall PCB exposure in humans, animals, and the environment.    PBDE concentrations compared to other studies  There are currently no tolerances established for PBDEs in fluid milk in the US [ 59 ]. Surprisingly, total PBDEs in bovine fluid milk have increased in various countries. In the U.S., ∑PBDEs in commercial cows’ milk increased by 28.8% between 2003 and 2009 [ 60 , 61 ]. Similarly, time trend studies from Sweden showed a 45% increase in levels of ∑PBDEs between 1999 and 2005 [ 59 , 62 ]. Specifically, time trend studies from Sweden showed a 62.5% increase in levels of BDE-47 between 1999 (0.005 ng/g wet weight) and 2005 (0.008 ng/g wet weight) [ 59 , 62 ]. In the U.S., BDE-99 and BDE-100 in bovine whole milk collected in Dallas, Texas (U.S.) increased by 22% and 100% at 2009 compared to data from 2003 [ 60 , 61 ]. BDE-47 was not detected in 2003 but identified as a major PDBE contributor with 2.57 pg/g wet weight in 2009. In our study, WM contained 18.0 pg/ml (GM) of BDE-47, which was identified as the dominant congener amongst the 12 congeners determined. The concentrations of BDE-99 (GM: 9.9 pg/mL) and BDE-100 (GM: 5.0 pg/mL) found in our WM samples were lower than the average concentrations of BDE-99 and BDE-100 found in milk samples collected in Dallas, Texas (US) in 2003 (1.58 ng/g wet weight, 0.23 ng/g wet weight) [ 60 ] and 2009 (1.93 ng/g wet weight and 0.46 ng/g wet weight) [ 61 ].  PBDE congener patterns observed in our milk study relate with that of commercial PBDE mixtures in North America and Europe [ 63 ]. BDE-47 and BDE-99 were the most abundant congeners in our study. In the U.S., DE-71 is considered the primary commercial PBDE product with mass production between 1976 and 2004 [ 63 , 64 ]. DE-71 is a penta-BDE mixture, comprised mainly of BDE-47 and BDE-99 (>70%), with smaller contributions from BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154 and trace levels of other lower brominated congeners (<2%) [ 64 , 65 ]. BDE-47 and BDE-99 have been identified as the major contributing congeners in milk in various regions of the world, including Finland [ 47 ], Italy [ 66 ], Spain [ 67 ], and Ghana [ 51 ]. Interestingly, in our milk samples BDE-49 contributed to a much larger degree to ∑PBDEs (7.2% in FFM and 9.1% in WM based on GM), compared to its proportion in DE-71 (< 1%) [ 68 ]. This finding may be a result of metabolism of higher brominated congeners. Animal studies have shown that highly brominated PBDE congeners, such as deca-BDEs, can be de-brominated and metabolized to lower brominated congeners [ 24 , 25 ] leading to increased levels of lower brominated PBDE congeners in vivo . In vitro studies have shown differences in biotransformation between BDE-47 and BDE-99 using human liver microsomes [ 22 , 69 ]. While there are no data on metabolism of PBDEs in bovine, BDE-99 has been shown to be de-brominated to BDE-49 in Chinook Salmon[ 27 ]. BDE-99 was also shown to be more extensively metabolized than BDE-47 in rats [ 28 ]. It is well established that biotransformation pathways are influenced by many biological factors, including species, age, hormone status, pregnancy, preexisting health conditions, and genetic polymorphisms [ 29 ].  We considered the potential sources of contamination of PBDEs and PCBs in commercial bovine milk. We provided information on the geographic location where milk was purchased in S1 Table . It is important to note that information as to the location of the dairy processor does not allow for information down to the level of location of contributing farms towards an individual lot of produced milk. Based on the fact that all of our milk samples are from dairy processors in the Northern Region of California, we can merely speculate as to the possible sources of contamination. Diet could be an exposure source for PBDE and PCBs in dairy cows. Dairy cows are usually kept in constant environments being fed a total mixed ration consisting of specific commodity components. The total mixed ration typically contains corn and or corn silage, a feed component documented to contain PCBs and PBDEs [ 70 – 72 ]. There are studies reporting PCB levels in fresh grass from the United Kingdom and corn from Italy [ 72 , 73 ]. While the locations for these feed ingredients differed, corn samples had 10–1000 times the PCB content measured in grass. This may be due to the fact that corn contains a large amount of fatty acids [ 74 ] which would allow easier partitioning of these lipophilic pollutants into the roots or leaves. Various forms of corn that are used in feed have lipid percentages ranging from 3.8–10% while those among different grasses range from 2.0–4.1% [ 75 ]. Based on these data, rations including corn, such as typical dairy cow rations, may contain higher levels of PCBs and PBDEs than animals grazing pastures. Thus, dairy cattle may be exposed to higher levels of these contaminants through their diets.  More specific to the location of the dairy processors in our study, we speculate that the use of flame retardants may play a role in the detected PBDE contaminant levels. Many of the Northern California counties are located in areas that are at high risk for wildfires, or where wildfires have occurred in California in recent years ( http://frap.fire.ca.gov/webdata/maps/statewide/fhszs_map.pdf ). It is likely that flame retardants were used in these regions due to the fire risk, and also due to the high level of firefighting activities ongoing in the area. This conclusion is supported by multiple pieces of evidence. One being the fact that PBDEs are in fact present in firefighter equipment [ 76 ]. Second, California firefighters themselves that have been studied and results from two different populations show that due to their activities their sera contain levels of PBDEs far above those found in the general California population [ 77 , 78 ]. Third, the dust from a total of 20 fire stations in Southern California contained higher levels of PBDEs compared to dust in residential homes [ 79 ]. A common factor among these mentioned studies are the PBDEs that are most prominent or make up the dominant portion namely BDE-47, -99, -153, -154, and -209. This directly ties back to our dataset with the PBDE congeners that are present in our milk samples shown in Table 3 . California mainly used penta-BDE mixtures before they were banned, and the major components of these mixtures were BDE-47, -99, -153, and -154 [ 80 ] adding further support for the increased use of flame retardants in Northern California contributing to the PBDE content in bovine milk made in Northern California. The major PBDE congeners of past flame retardant mixtures along with the prominent ones present in firefighter’s clothing and serum and the dust of fire stations are PBDE congeners that are higher in serum from the Northern region of California.  While the industrial processes are considered less likely to result in milk contamination, materials used during processing and storage must be considered. Raw milk is generally stored in stainless steel tanks until processing. Processed milk may be stored in containers made of plastic. Based on a study by Webb et al. [ 81 ] plastics can degrade in the environment by four mechanisms: photodegradation, thermooxidative degradation, hydrolytic degradation and biodegradation by microorganisms. None of these degradation processes are likely to occur during storage and processing of milk. Thus, while contamination during processing cannot be completely ruled out, it is an unlikely source of PCB or PBDE contamination.  Although this study fills important data gaps, some limitations are worth consideration. Each group of milk samples consisted of only eight different brands and samples were only collected in the central valley of California at one time point. Differences in PCB and PBDE congener patterns between our data and those reported from other studies may be a result of different congener mixtures being used, especially when comparing results to other countries. In addition, differences in husbandry and feeding practices, regional distinctions affecting contaminant levels such as run-off from wastewater treatment plants, industrial emissions, or air-soil deposition differences, may contribute to the observed differences. Despite these limitations, the major focus of this research is the assessment of PBDEs and PCBs in dietary milk ready for human consumption in California compared to other national and international studies. Clearly there is much more work to be done in this area, and we expect that further work will uncover additional factors that contribute to the occurrences and differences in PBDE and PCB levels in animal-derived foods.     Conclusions  In summary, contamination of bovine milk with PCBs and PBDEs is not unexpected and was confirmed in our study. The ∑PCBs in bovine milk samples were several orders of magnitude below the U.S. FDA tolerance for milk fat. Our findings provide further evidence for the importance of assessing non-legacy PCBs, such as PCB-11, in dietary sources. ∑PBDEs determined in our milk samples suggest the dynamic profile of PBDE concentrations based on geographic regions and calendar time. Finally, regular screening of dairy products is essential to assess the occurrence of contributions from dietary sources for environmental contaminant exposure.

Cable joint insulation breakdown may cause a huge loss to power companies. Therefore, it is vital to diagnose the insulation quality to detect early signs of insulation failure. It is well known that there is a correlation between Partial discharge (PD) and the insulation quality. Although many works have been done on PD pattern recognition, it is usually performed in a noise free environment. Also, works on PD pattern recognition in actual cable joint are less likely to be found in literature. Therefore, in this work, classifications of actual cable joint defect types from partial discharge data contaminated by noise were performed. Five cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared based on the defects commonly encountered on site. Three different types of input feature were extracted from the PD pattern under artificially created noisy environment. These include statistical features, fractal features and principal component analysis (PCA) features. These input features were used to train the classifiers to classify each PD defect types. Classifications were performed using three different artificial intelligence classifiers, which include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It was found that the classification accuracy decreases with higher noise level but PCA features used in SVM and ANN showed the strongest tolerance against noise contamination.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003093  Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia    H-16001-D00048   http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5061-1809  Hazlee Azil Illias        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003093  Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia    FP043-2013B   Ab Halim Abu Bakar        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004781  Institut Pengurusan dan Pemantauan Penyelidikan, Universiti Malaya    PG028-2016A   http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5061-1809  Hazlee Azil Illias     This work was supported by H-16001-D00048 Malaysia Ministry of higher Education HAI; FP043-2013B Malaysia Ministry of higher Education AHAB; PG028-2016A University of Malaya HAI.

Introduction  Important power system equipment such as gas insulated switchgear, transformers and high voltage (HV) power cables operation life span is highly dependent on the insulation quality. They will be permanently damaged if insulation breakdown occurs. Failure in any part of the power system will be detrimental to energy generation and transmission companies. Hence, it is extremely important to check the insulation quality frequently. Partial discharge (PD) measurement is globally accepted as a useful diagnostic technique with the ability to assess insulation material for its condition [ 1 ]. According to the IEC 60270 standard, PD is defined as “localized electrical discharge that only partially bridges the insulation between conductors.” [ 2 ]. PD is repetitive in nature and able to spread across the dielectric material. PD intensifies existing insulation impairment and causes steady deterioration of insulating quality, ultimately leading to electrical breakdown, hazard to personnel, environmental damage and costly equipment failures [ 3 ]. Since PD events may lead to disastrous results with both safety and financial consequences, detection of PD events are used as a key method in insulation system condition monitoring [ 4 ].  PD classification is of interest because of the relationship between the PD activity and the dielectric materials aging process. Since each defect has a unique deterioration behavior, it is important to recognize the association between the PD patterns and the defect type in order to determine the insulation quality. PD pattern recognition is crucial in determining substantial risk of an imminent insulation breakdown and consequently whether the current component requires servicing and replacement or not [ 5 ]. Many works have been performed on PD classification in various power system equipment, such as gas insulated switchgears and substations [ 6 , 7 ], power cables [ 8 , 9 ] and transformers [ 10 , 11 ]. Commonly used classifiers include neural networks [ 7 , 12 ], fuzzy logic [ 13 , 14 ] and support vector machines [ 15 , 16 ].  PD has a group of unique discriminatory attributes, which allows them to be recognized. In order to perform PD classification, it is necessary to choose which discriminatory features to be extracted and which feature extraction method to be used [ 17 ]. The purpose of feature extraction is to extract meaningful input feature from the unprocessed PD data to represent the PD pattern associated with a specific defect [ 18 ]. These extracted features are used as input of the classifier during the training process. Feature extraction also helps to reduce the size of raw PD data for quicker and simpler handling. PD classification requires some sort of data reduction method, such as reducing the matrix size [ 19 ]. This is due to unprocessed PD data which may contain thousands to millions of individual pulses are too huge to be used as input to the classifiers as it will drastically increase the training time and cripple the performance of the classifier [ 20 , 21 ].  Most of PD classification works were performed in lab environment and under noise free environment. However, in reality, on site PD measurement suffers from lower detection sensitivity due to the interference of external noises [ 22 ]. PD measurement often faces interference caused by radio transmissions, power electronics components, random noise from switching, lightning, arcing, harmonics and interferences from ground connections [ 23 ]. A lot of research work has been performed on denoising PD data. One of the methods involves setting a threshold and ignoring PD data that are 10% of the maximum PD amplitude. However, it was found to be insufficient as high threshold level might neglect real PD pulses with low magnitude and low threshold level will include noise [ 24 , 25 ]. Using the mean square error as a benchmark to compare 28 types of denoising technique, wavelet based denoising was found to be the best with good signal to noise ratio [ 26 ]. Numerous research works have also used wavelet transform for denoising purposes, especially the Daubechies wavelet, which is capable of detecting high frequency, fast decaying, short duration, and low amplitude signals [ 27 , 28 ].  PD denoising techniques have improved over the years. However, a perfect and universal denoising standard has yet to be achieved. Therefore, some researchers have included artificial noise signals into PD data before evaluating the PD classification model in order to replicate the practical scenario. For example, adding evenly distributed random number to phase and charge of PD data [ 1 , 29 ], adding white noise with zero mean and fluctuating power [ 23 ], including random numbers with various standard deviation and zero mean [ 30 ] and merging randomly distributed noise that are within 10 to 30% of the test data [ 31 – 37 ]. The effect of adding noise are summarized as follows; in [ 1 ], the accuracy of ANN reduces from 79% under noise free condition to 42.2% with 10% added noise, in [ 36 , 37 ], the accuracy of ANN reduces from 100% under noise free condition to 80% with 30% random noise, in [ 34 , 38 ], when 30% noise was introduced, the accuracy of ANN reduces from 100% to between 70 and 80% depending on the input feature used. In [ 31 ], ANN accuracy reduces from 93.7% to 83.3%.  However, artificially generated noise using software, as applied in previous works may not represent real world scenario. Therefore, in this work, classifications of cable joint defect types from PD measurement under noisy environment were performed. Real life noise obtained from ground interference instead of software generated noise as commonly used in past works was used in this work. This is a better representation of noise encountered on-site. Five cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared. After PD measurement was performed on each cable joint sample, different input features were extracted from the PD pattern under artificially created noisy environment. These include statistical features, fractal features and principal component analysis (PCA) features. The input features were used to train the classifiers to classify the PD defect types using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). At the end of the work, comparison between different combinations of feature extraction and classifiers was made to determine which method has the highest classification accuracy result or highest noise tolerance.  Time series analysis is a very useful tool. The directed weighted complex network method can be used to distinguish and characterize different dynamical regimes associated with unstable periodic orbits from time series signals [ 39 ]. For nonlinear dynamic behavior in gas—liquid two-phase flow, the multivariate weighted complex network can be used [ 40 ]. On the other hand, multivariate pseudo Wigner distribution allows uncovering local flow behavior revealing different oil—water flow patterns [ 41 ]. Gao et al. proposed a multiscale limited penetrable horizontal visibility graph to analyze nonlinear time series [ 42 ] and then developed a novel AOK-TFR based visibility graph to classify epileptic EEG signals [ 43 ].  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the test samples preparation. In section 3, the measurement setup is outlined. Section 4 elaborates on the feature extraction methods used. The classifiers used are explained in Section 5, followed by the results in Section 6. Lastly, the conclusion can be found at Section 7.    2. Sample Preparation  Five 11 kV XLPE cable joint with different artificial defects were prepared. The total length of each cable sample is 3 meters with a cable joint located in the centre. The details of the defect nature of all cable joint samples are shown in Table 1 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170111.t001  Table 1  XLPE cable joint defect samples.           Sample  XLPE Cable Joint Defect      C1  Insulation incision defect    C2  Axial direction shift    C3  Semiconductor layer tip    C4  Metal particle on XLPE    C5  Semiconductor layer air gap       Insulation incision defect was prepared by creating a shallow cut at the XLPE surface using a blade. Axial direction shift defect was prepared by inserting the cable at a shifted angle. Semiconductor layer tip defect was made by making numerous sharp edges at the semiconductor tip. Metal particle on XLPE defect was prepared by spreading metal bits on the XLPE layer while semiconductor layer air gap defect was prepared by wrapping insulation tape at the boarder of the semiconductor layer and XLPE insulation layer. All cable defects were created on the cable prior to the cable joints installation.    3. PD Measurement Setup  Fig 1 shows the block diagram of the PD measurement system that was used in this work. The measurement setup comprises of a step-up transformer that serves as a high voltage source, a coupling device, a test object, a coupling and measuring capacitor, a USB controller and a PD detector connected to a personal computer. A personal computer (PC) was used to store the measured PD data. A commercial PD detector MPD600 from Omicron was used in this work.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170111.g001  Fig 1   Block diagram of PD measurement setup.     All measurements were performed at 9 kV, which is slightly less than the 11 kV rated voltage of the cable. This is because operating at higher applied voltage will significantly increase the likelihood of insulation breakdown at cable joint defect, which will cause permanent damage to the test sample. Each cable joint was energized to 9 kV and allowed to be idle for 1 hour for the PD to reach a steady state before PD measurement was taken. Each PD measurement was taken for 1 minute with a time gap of 15 seconds between every measurement. A total of 100 measurements were performed on each cable joint sample. The results are shown in term of phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns, a 3D plot with phase, charge magnitude and pulse count as the main axis.    4. Feature Extractions  In this work, three different feature extractions method were used to obtain relevant identifiers from the PD data; they are statistical features, fractal features and principal component analysis (PCA) features. These features are chosen because they are the most commonly used features in PD classification. They are then combined together to enhance the performance of classifiers using multiple features instead of individual features. These input features were used to train the ANN, ANFIS, and SVM to classify defect types.   4.1 Statistical Features  PD data can be characterized by two main distributions; pulse count distribution, which is the number of PD vs. phase angle and pulse height distribution, which is the PD charge magnitude vs. phase angle. These distributions can be further split into two separate distributions, which are the negative and positive half cycles. Statistical features were extracted from these PD distributions, which include skewness, kurtosis, mean, variance and the Weibull parameter.  Skewness is the degree of asymmetry of the distribution with regard to the normal distribution. Positive skewness shows that the distribution is asymmetric with a bigger left side, zero skewness shows that the distribution is symmetric and negative skewness shows that the distribution is asymmetric with a larger right side [ 44 ].  Kurtosis is the degree of the sharpness of the distribution with regard to a normal distribution. Zero kurtosis shows that the distribution is a normal shape, positive kurtosis shows that the distribution is a sharp shape and negative kurtosis shows that the distribution is flat shape [ 45 ].  Variance is a measurement of how much a cluster of numbers is spread out. Zero variance shows that all values in the distribution are identical. The standard deviation is acquired by calculating the square root of the variance. A very detailed mathematical description of skewness and kurtosis can be found in [ 46 ]. The mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis are calculated using     Mean : μ = ∑ i = 1 N x i f ( x i ) ∑ i = 1 N f ( x i )    (1)       Variance : σ 2 = ∑ i = 1 N ( x i − μ ) 2 f ( x i ) ∑ i = 1 N f ( x i )    (2)       Skewness : S k = ∑ i = 1 N ( x i − μ ) 3 f ( x i ) σ 3 ∑ i = 1 N f ( x i )    (3)       Kurtosis : K u = ∑ i = 1 N ( x i − μ ) 4 f ( x i ) σ 4 ∑ i = 1 N f ( x i ) − 3    (4)  where f ( x i ) is the function of interest, N is the size of the data and x i is discrete values of the distribution.  Weibull analysis is a mathematical approach to characterize the pulse height analysis pattern. The probability distribution of PD pulse rate, F can be expressed by the Weibull function [ 20 , 47 ] as     F ( q ; α ; β ) = 1 − exp [ − ( q α ) β ]    (5)  where α and β represents each pulse height analysis curve and the PD pulse amplitude is represented by q . The features α +, β +, α - and β - are obtained from the negative and positive pulse height analysis curves [ 20 ]. The pulse height analysis pattern is then compacted using the Weibull method for statistical analysis while keeping its relevant information. The values of α +, β +, α - and β - are then used as the input to the intelligent classifiers along with variance, skewness, kurtosis and mean.    4.2 Fractal Features  Fractal features are suitable for modeling complex shapes and natural phenomena where current mathematical methods are found to be inadequate. Since PD can be treated as a natural phenomenon that has complicated shapes and surfaces, fractal features can be used to model it. The implementation of fractal features in PD recognition is interesting because it characterizes the PRPD pattern directly [ 48 ].  Fractal features can also be used for pattern recognition [ 49 ]. PRPD pattern can be characterized using two fractal features, fractal dimension and lacunarity, which are computed by using box counting technique. Fractal dimension is one of the main fractal features that could be computed from an image surface. In theory, fractal dimension is invariant to changes in scale and has the potential to be used for measuring the coarseness of the surface. However, fractal dimension alone is not enough to be a discriminatory feature because different surface may have the exact same value of fractal dimension. In order to solve this problem, Mandelbrot has introduced a new variable called lacunarity, which represents the compactness of the fractal surface. Both fractal dimension ( D ) and lacunarity ( Λ ) are functions of the box size L . The number of boxes N , of side L needed to cover a fractal set is governed by     N ( L ) = K L − D    (6)  where D is the fractal dimension set and K is a constant [ 50 ]. The lacunarity Λ ( L ) relies on the second order statistics of p ( m , L ). It can be defined after calculating M ( L ) and M 2 ( L ). Λ ( L ), M ( L ) and M 2 ( L ) are calculated using [ 51 ]     ∧ ( L ) = M 2 ( L ) − [ M ( L ) ] 2 [ M ( L ) ] 2    (7)       M ( L ) = ∑ m = 1 N m p ( m , L )    (8)       M 2 ( L ) = ∑ m = 1 N m 2 p ( m , L )    (9)  where m is the box number. In this work, PRPD patterns were converted into a binary image and the software ImageJ was used to calculate the fractal dimension and lacunarity using the box counting method [ 52 ].    4.3 Principal Component Analysis  PCA, also known as the Karhunen-Loève (K-L) method is a data reduction method that can filter out the important factors from a big group of data [ 53 ]. It is able to transform the data from a very high dimension to a lower dimension. This is done without compromising data information in the reduced space, with only minimal information loss. This is achieved by projecting data at a direction with the biggest variance at a lower dimension that will maximize the scatter of the projected samples [ 54 ]. This linear subspace is found by solving an Eigen problem,     cov ( X ) M = λ M    (10)  where cov ( X ) is the covariance matrix of the dataset X , M is a linear mapping created by the d principle eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and λ are the d principal eigenvalues. The low-dimensional data y i of the data points x i are calculated using linear mapping Y = XM . The elements of Y will produce the feature sets [ 17 ]. This covariance matrix is able to determine which direction contains the most significant variance in the dataset, making PCA an effective tool for feature subset selection.  The most important concern in PCA is the amount of principal components required to obtain an accurate representation of the original data. The best number of principal components to represent the data can be found by using a scree plot. Scree plot is a graph of the eigenvalue magnitude vs. its number. The best number is chosen at a point where the graph has a sudden change in a slope, where the slope on its left side is much higher than the right side. [ 53 ].  The PD data were arranged into 3 column matrix of phase, magnitude and pulse count which is similar to the PRPD format. Two situations were considered for PCA feature extraction. In the first situation, the PD matrix was split into four distributions, negative and positive section of the charge magnitude while the phase was divided into two 180 degrees’ quadrants. In the second situation, the PD matrix was arranged into six distributions, negative and positive section of the charge magnitude while the phase was divided into four 90 degrees’ quadrants. PCA was performed on these distributions to obtain the first and second principal components.     5. Classifiers  Three intelligent classifiers were used; they are Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These classifiers were trained and then used to classify defect types of the cable joint samples in this work.   5.1 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  ANN is suitable for PD classification because it is insensitive to small input changes. ANN has the ability to continue making correct decisions even when the input presented is slightly different from the input used during training process. This is very important for PD classification where the discharge patterns are usually not the same [ 55 ].  ANN consists of one layer of input, a minimum of one hidden layer and one output layer [ 1 , 56 ]. The feed forward back propagation neural network is the most commonly used learning mode in ANN [ 57 ]. It is a supervised learning network that is trained in a forward backward process. In the forward process, the biases and weights are initialized into random small values. The feature vector that belongs to its correlating sample is then used to compute the neurons output in each layer using an activation function that can be threshold using different functions [ 12 ].  Every layer in the ANN is completely connected to the following layer. The main purpose of the hidden layer is to obtain PD features from different sources and send the information to the output layer. The amount of processing elements in the input layer relies on the amount of PD fingerprint data. The amount of processing element within the output layer is dependent on the number of defect types to be classified [ 45 ]. For PD classification purpose, a minimum of two input features are required to avoid divergence during training [ 58 ]. In this work, a multilayer feed forward ANN with 15 neurons at the hidden layer and the scaled conjugate gradient back propagation training function were used. Sigmoid function was used as the activation function at the hidden layer and output layer.    5.2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)  ANFIS uses neural networks and fuzzy systems to find the best fuzzy parameters [ 59 ]. The usage of neural network omits the requirement to select the fuzzy parameters manually because it will be done by the neural network. The fuzzy system must be built using fuzzy logic prior to the fuzzy scheme training in ANFIS. ANFIS is based on a fuzzy Sugeno model introduced by Takagi, Sugeno and Kang. ANFIS is a great tool to map PD patterns to the defect type using If-Then rules formed by the decision tree and the stipulated input output data [ 60 ].      Rule  1 :  If  x  is  C 1  and  y  is  D 1 ,  then  f 1 = p 1 x + q 1 y + r 1 ,         Rule  2 :  If  x  is  C 2  and  y  is  D 2 ,  then  f 2 = p 2 x + q 2 y + r 2 .     The ANFIS architecture has five important layers [ 61 ]. The first layer is filled with nodes called adaptive nodes. The outputs of this layer are known as the fuzzy membership grade of the inputs. In the second layer, it contains constant nodes that function as a multiplier for incoming signal. The output of this layer is called the firing strength of the rules. The third layer contains fixed nodes, which concentrates on normalizing the second layer’s triggering strength. In the fourth layer, the nodes are adaptive nodes. It will produce output which is the product of the first order polynomial and the firing strength that had been normalized. The last layer contains only one fixed node, which does a summation of all output signals from the previous layer.  Rules fuzzification is done by allocating fuzzy membership function (MF) to each condition in the premise part of the rules. Each input variable is normalized between zero and one in order to increase the training efficiency [ 62 ]. Utilizing these fuzzy rules, ANFIS is used to train, test and analyze the Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system [ 63 ]. Every rule output works as a linear combination of input variables and a fixed value. The final output is the output weighted mean of each rule. These weights are automatically altered using the information acquired during the training process. For ANFIS, Matlab command “genfis2” was used to generate a Sugeno type fuzzy inference system using subtractive clustering. “Genfis2” was used instead of “genfis1” since it is more suitable for large amount of data used in this work. The ANFIS used has 20 “epoc” and 1 “radii,” where “epoc” is the maximum number of times before the training process is stopped. “Radii” is a vector that specifies a cluster center range of influence in each data dimensions, assuming the data falls within a unit hyperbox.    5.3 Support Vector Machine  SVM is a machine learning algorithm that stem from statistical learning theory. This learning machine uses a main concept of SVM, which is kernel for a variety of learning tasks. Using kernel methods, SVMs can be adjusted to multiple types of tasks by using different base algorithm and kernel functions. SVM excels in pattern recognition problems involving nonlinear, small sample size and high dimensionality [ 64 ].  SVM is a method for searching functions from a group of known as training data. Individual group of PD pattern data can be characterized by specific input features. Therefore, each group of data can be designated by a vector whose size and dimension relies on the number of input features selected to characterize it. The function can be either a regression function or a classification function. It is commonly utilized to process classification and regression problems.  SVM is initially intended to handle linearly separable cases. Unfortunately, not all practical problems are linearly separated. When dealing with non-linear problems, conventional SVM as a linear classifier will not function effectively. To overcome this problem, a technique known as kernel was presented to deal with non-linear problems using multiple linear classifier. According to the pattern recognition theory, a lower dimensional space and non-linear inseparable model are transformed into linear separable by mapping it nonlinearly into a higher dimensional feature space. Therefore, the usage of kernel method will avoid the curse of dimensionality [ 15 ].  SVM algorithm was initially intended for binary classification, which means they can only classify inputs into two classes [ 65 ]. This is because SVM uses a hyper plane to split data into two categories. If more than two groups of classification are required, multi-level SVM is needed [ 66 , 67 ]. Multi-level SVM is a one against all classifiers, where multiple binary SVM is performed. During multi-level SVM training, a category sample will be classified as one class while the other residual samples as other classes. In this work, a multilevel SVM with the radial basis function kernel was used as the classifier.     6. Results  The measurement results from this study are shown in this section. The results include the PD patterns measured and classification accuracy results of ANN, ANFIS, and SVM using statistical, fractal and PCA features. Next, the noise tolerance of each classifier was examined.   6.1 Measured PD in PRPD format  In order to determine the classification accuracy of each feature extraction and intelligence classifier method under noisy environment, the classifiers are trained using uncontaminated input but tested with inputs that are contaminated with noise. Feature extractions are performed on the contaminated PD data and used as the test input to each classifier method. The noise contamination is recorded from interference from the ground during lightning events. The recorded noisy signals are added to the noise-free PD data for duration of between 5 and 60 seconds.  Four of the PRPD patterns of the recorded noisy signal are shown in Fig 2 . It can be seen that the noise pattern occurs randomly at every phase with a maximum amplitude of 250 pC and the number of PD activity increases as the duration of noise increases. Since it is impossible to control the amplitude of the noise contamination, different duration of the noise contamination was used to examine the classification accuracy of each classifier methods under noisy environment.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170111.g002  Fig 2   PRPD patterns of different noise duration; (a) 15 seconds, (b) 30 seconds, (c), 45 seconds, and (d) 60 seconds.     The phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) pattern of all cable joint samples that have been measured is shown in a 3D plot in Fig 3 . Based on visual inspection on the PRPD patterns, the insulation incision defect has two tall peaks at the end of both positive and negative cycles. The axial directional shift defect has more PD activities in the positive cycle, which accumulate at the first quadrant. It has a very sharp peak at around 80 degrees. The semiconductor layer tip defect has PD activities, which extend evenly between the positive and negative cycles. It has 5 noticeable peaks, 3 at the negative cycle and 2 at the positive cycle. The metal particle on XLPE defect has one main PD group at each positive and negative cycles and it has a prominent peak at 260 degrees. The semiconductor layer air gap defect has two main PD groups; one at the positive cycle and another at the negative cycle with a peak at 230 degrees. Two small clusters of PD with high charge magnitude but low pulse count can also be seen, where the negatively charged PD spread out between 180 to 360 degrees while the positively charged PDs are distributed between 0 and 180 degrees.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170111.g003  Fig 3   PRPD patterns from samples of different defects; (a) Insulation incision defect (b) axial direction shift defect, (c), semiconductor layer tip defect (d) metal particle on XLPE defect and (e) semiconductor layer air gap defect.     Although different defect types of cable joint have different PRPD patterns, classification of different defect types in the cable joint samples can be hardly done based on visual inspection on these PRPD patterns alone. Therefore, feature extractions from PD data and intelligent classifiers were used in this work to classify different defect types in the cable joint.    6.2 Feature extraction results  Using the feature extraction method of statistical features, fractal features and PCA features, eight groups of input feature data were obtained. Statistical features are split into three groups, the first group consist of variance, skewness, kurtosis and mean (var, skew, kur, mean), the second group consists of Weibull parameters while the third group is the combination of the first two groups. Fractal features were also split into three groups, which are fractal dimensions, lacunarity and a combination of fractal dimensions and lacunarity. PCA features were split into two groups and PCA features from 4 and 6 distributions are extracted. These input features were used as the input for the classifiers to determine the classification accuracy of each method. Sample input features extracted using each method are shown in Tables 2 , 3 and 4 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170111.t002  Table 2  Extracted statistical features.

ANFIS performed better than ANN when using statistical features but is the worst when using fractal features and PCA features. ANFIS is weak when using PCA features because ANFIS requires normalizing the input data during the training process to improve its efficiency [ 63 ]. PCA component contains of a different weighting; hence normalization will change the relative significance between each components, causing higher error rate in ANFIS [ 68 ].  It can be seen that for all three classifiers, using the combination of all statistical features and fractal features rather than splitting them results in higher classification accuracy. For PCA features, all classifiers are able to achieve higher classification accuracy when PCA is performed on 6 distributions instead of 4 distributions. Therefore, for classification accuracy test using noisy signals, only the full set of statistical parameters (variance, skewness, kurtosis, mean, Weibull parameters), fractal features (fractal dimension and lacunarity) and PCA features for 6 distributions were considered.  The effect of increasing feature size on the training duration for all classifiers is shown in Fig 4 . From this figure, SVM has the fastest training speed, followed by ANN and ANFIS. SVM and ANN training speed is not directly affected by the size of the input feature and remains relatively consistent when the feature size is increased. ANFIS, on the other hand, experiences increased training duration when the input feature size is increased.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170111.g004  Fig 4   Training time vs feature size for PD classifiers.     After the performance of ANN, ANFIS and SVM with noise-free PD data has been evaluated, the classifiers were tested using features extracted from PD data that have been overlapped with noise contamination of different durations. The classification accuracy results of these classifiers are shown in Table 6 . From Table 6 , it can be seen that the classification accuracy generally decreases for all classifiers and input feature combinations when more noise is added.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170111.t006  Table 6  Classification accuracy results using PD data added with noise.

From this figure, it can be seen that although statistical features and fractal features suffer from significant reduction in classification accuracy, statistical features still achieve higher classification rate than fractal features for ANN and ANFIS when the noise duration is increased. ANFIS performs slightly better with fractal features as the input was used in noise-free PD data but its performance with the statistical features is better than fractal features.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170111.g005  Fig 5   Noise tolerance of; (a) ANN, (b) ANFIS, and (c) SVM.     When each classifier was tested with noisy PD data, classifier with PCA features as the input data performs better than with fractal features and statistical features. Although the classification accuracy by using PCA features is not the best for noise-free PD data for all classifiers, the classification accuracy is better than other feature extractions when being tested with noisy data. This is due to the changes to the original PD data due to noise are minimized during the process of transforming the PD data from a higher dimension to a lower dimension. Thus, this causes classification accuracy using PCA features and intelligent classifiers to be less affected by different durations of noise contamination compared to statistical and fractal features.  Referring to Table 6 , the best classification method is PCA combined with SVM, where the highest classification accuracy is 93.6% under 5-second noise duration and 75.6% under 60-second noise duration. Comparing with previous works in [ 1 ], the accuracy of ANN reduces from 79% under noise free condition to 42.2% with 10% added noise while in [ 34 , 38 ], when 30% noise was introduced, the accuracy of ANN reduces from 100% to between 70 and 80%. Hence, this shows that the proposed method in this work is reasonable and has an improvement over the previous methods used for PD classification under noisy condition. This is due the classification accuracy reduction is smaller than the previous works when noise contamination was added to PD signals.     7. Conclusions  Classifications of real cable joint defect types from partial discharge measurement under noisy environment have been successfully performed. Feature extractions were performed on the PD data and used as the input data for artificial intelligence classifiers to classify cable joint defect types. From the classification accuracy results, feature extraction using principal component analysis (PCA) features and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers show the highest classification accuracy when being tested with noisy PD data. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) classifier is not suitable to be used with PCA features due to the design of the classifier which requires normalization during training. Classification accuracy by using feature extractions of fractal features and statistical features with the classifiers is better than using PCA features for noise-free PD data but is worse for noisy PD data. If computational time is not an important factor, it is recommended that the three input features (include statistical features, fractal features and principal component analysis) are used together to complement each other. However, if only one type of classifier and input feature is to be used in a highly noisy environment, PCA features and SVM or ANN is recommended for PD classification.

Background  Cognitive deficits such as poor selective attention and executive functions decline have been reported in patients with schizophrenia. Many studies have emphasized the role of dopamine in regulating cognitive functions in the general population as well as in schizophrenia. However, the relationship between cognitive processes, schizophrenia and dopaminergic candidate genes is an original approach given interesting results. The purpose of the current exploratory study was to examine the interaction of dopaminergic genes (coding for dopamine receptor D2, DRD2 , and for Catecholamine-O-Methyl-Transferase, COMT ) with the diagnostic of schizophrenia in (i) the executive control of attention, (ii) selective attention, and (iii) executive functions.    Methods and Results  We recruited 52 patients with schizophrenia and 53 healthy controls who performed the Stroop Color-Word Test, the Attention Network Test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting test. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DRD2 gene (rs6275, rs6277, rs2242592 and rs1800497) and two SNPs in the COMT gene (rs4680 and rs165599) have been genotyped. Patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than controls in all cognitive performance, taking into account demographic variables. A significant gene by disease interaction was found for the Stroop interference (p = 0.002) for rs6275 of the DRD2 gene. The COMT Val/Val genotype and schizophrenia were associated with increased number of perseverative errors (p = 0.01).    Conclusions  In our study, the DRD2 gene is involved in attention while the COMT gene is implicated in executive functions in patients with schizophrenia.

Many genes are reported to be associated with the disease, each conferring only a small risk [ 2 , 3 ]. Environmental factors and interactions between genetic and environment are also likely to contribute to schizophrenia [ 4 , 5 ]. Dopamine system has been the focus of decades of research in schizophrenia. The gene coding for the dopamine receptor D2 ( DRD2) , located on chromosome 11q22-2, is one of the most studied marker of susceptibility for schizophrenia [ 6 ]. We have previously reported a strong association between schizophrenia and various polymorphisms within the DRD2/ANKK1 locus, including rs1800497 in the ANKK1 gene, including rs2242592 in the intergenic region and rs6277 in DRD2 gene [ 7 ]. Moreover, rs1800497 was over-transmitted from parents to the affected child [ 8 ]. Genetic studies have confirmed the positive association between rs1800497 and schizophrenia (for review, we refer the reader to [ 9 ]).  In spite of some controversies, alterations in catecholamine metabolism have also been studied in schizophrenia [ 10 , 11 ]. Catecholamine-O-Methyl-Transferase ( COMT) gene located in chromosome 22q11 codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamines, including dopamine [ 10 ]. The COMT Val 108/158 Met polymorphism (rs4680) influences enzyme activity, with the valine allele associated with a higher enzymatic activity and an increase risk of schizophrenia [ 10 , 12 ]. The G allele of the rs165599 in COMT has also been associated with schizophrenia [ 13 ].  Neuropsychological impairments have been reported in schizophrenia and could be present from the first psychotic episode [ 14 , 15 ]. Cognitive deficits in (i) the executive control of attention, (ii) selective attention, and (iii) executive functions are considered to be core features of the disease and have an important role on the prognosis and functional disability associated with schizophrenia [ 16 , 17 ]. Their poor performances may portend worst outcome [ 15 ]. One of the most commonly observed cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia patients is deficit in performance on task in selective attention [ 18 ]. The executive control of attention governs the capacity to decide among conflicting responses and to give a response to one aspect of a stimulus by ignoring a dominant aspect. The executive control of attention is often studied by tasks that involve conflict such as the Stroop Color-Word. Using this paradigm, schizophrenia is associated with a reduction in the ability of cognitive inhibition of an overlearned response [for review [ 19 ]. In healthy controls, the attention and the conflict process activate the anterior cingulate cortex [ 20 ].  Attention is the basis of various control systems, and is defined as the efficiency of three reliable, anatomically-distinct organized networks: alerting, orienting and executive control [ 21 ]. The attention network test (ANT) is a paradigm designed to investigate attention efficiencies of alerting, orienting, and executive control of attention [ 22 ], on the basis of a concept of an integrative selective attention system [ 23 ]. The alerting function shows strong thalamic involvement and activation of fronto-parietal cortex [ 24 ], and the orienting function activates parietal lobe [ 25 ]. To assess executive function, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is commonly used. It has been shown that the performance of the WCST engages the prefrontal cortex in healthy volunteers [ 26 , 27 ] and in schizophrenia patients [ 28 ].  Attentional performances in the general population are influenced by genetic factors. Fan et al. [ 29 ] showed that genetic variations, contributing to individual differences in the executive attention of the ANT performance, involve dopamine rich frontal areas, including the anterior cingulate. An interaction effect between rs4680 COMT gene and rs1800497 ANKK1/DRD2 locus on interference performance on the Stroop Color-Word test has been found in a sample from the general population. A worsened Stroop performance has been observed in subjects homozygous for the Met allele at rs4680 in the absence of T allele of rs1800497 [ 30 ]. Healthy subjects carrying CC genotype of the rs1800497 have revealed a significant greater conflict when they performed the ANT protocol [ 31 ]. A previous study has also shown a slight statistical trend toward higher conflict ANT for healthy subjects homozygous Met/Met of the COMT gene [ 32 ]. However, this observation was not replicated [ 33 ]. The executive components of attention may be heritable in normal subjects.  Thus, the Stroop Color-Word test as the executive control of the ANT serve as a possible endophenotype in schizophrenia [ 29 , 34 , 35 ]. Less is known about the association between schizophrenia, the executive control of attention and genetic factors.  Concerning executive performances, Rodriguez-Jimenez et al. have found in healthy subjects that the carriers of the T allele of the rs6277 performed better at WCST than carriers of the CC genotype [ 36 ]. Finally, CC genotype of rs6277 has been associated with a decreased of the general cognitive ability, while no difference has been found with rs4680 of the COMT gene [ 37 ].  The present exploratory study has investigated four SNPs in the DRD2/ANKK1 locus (rs6275, rs6277, rs2242592 and rs1800497) and two SNPs in the COMT gene (rs4680 and rs165599) in order to analyze their association with attention and executive function, in patients with schizophrenia as compared to healthy volunteers. For each SNP, the allele or the genotype previously associated to schizophrenia and considered as the “vulnerability” allele or genotype according to literature has been compared between patients and controls. The aim of the current study was (a) to test the hypothesis that patients carrying the vulnerability allele or genotype of each SNP show a decline in cognitive performances compared with subjects homozygous for the other allele and (b) to examine the possible interactions between disease and SNPs influences on cognitive efficiency.    Materials and Methods   Subjects  We recruited 52 outpatients with schizophrenia and 53 healthy controls from a psychiatric department of a French university hospital in Paris suburb. All subjects were evaluated by an experienced psychiatrist using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) [ 38 ], that is a semi-structured interview leading to a lifetime diagnosis according to the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and other psychiatric diseases [ 39 ]. Inclusion for patients with schizophrenia required a combination of criteria including (1) having a stable state with no change in medication or symptoms for at least 4 weeks before the cognitive evaluation, (2) being treated exclusively with atypical antipsychotics, with no anticholinergic agents or mood stabilizers, (3) having had a relatively short course of illness (less than 10 years). All patients are clinically stable, as assessed with the PANSS [ 40 ], and fully able to cooperate with testing. According to the literature, a relatively short illness follow-up time and all being treated with atypical antipsychotics are supposed to have beneficial effect on cognition [ 41 , 42 ] with no other drugs that affect cognition, allowing to study a homogeneous group of patients.  Controls were included only if they were between 28 and 65 years old and were recruited through partners of patients admitted in the psychiatric department. Control subjects had no first-degree family history of bipolar or schizophrenia disorder. All subjects (patients and controls) were without any history of current substance abuse, brain injury or neurological disease, medical condition or medication known to be associated with neuropsychological impairment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All subjects were euthymic as evaluated by the Montgomery and Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) [ 43 ] and the Young Mania Rating Scale [ 44 ], and they had no mental retardation as evaluated by National Adult Reading Test (NART) [ 45 ].  Patients and healthy volunteers all gave their written informed consent after hearing a complete description of the study. The study protocol was approved by the French Ethics and Data Protection and Freedom of Information Commissions (Comité Consultatif National d’Ethique and the Commission Nationale d‘Informatique et des Libertés).    Procedure  Patients and healthy controls have performed the Stroop Color-Word Test, the Attention Network Test, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test to assess attention and executive functions.  The Stroop Color-Word interference test measures selective attention [ 46 ]. This task tests the ability to attend only to the color in which a word is written while ignoring the distractor, which is what the word means. Participants are presented with a series of cards containing 100 stimuli from one condition and are asked to respond to each stimulus without stopping. The total time per card is the measure of performance in a given condition. The subject is asked first to read the names of colors written in black ink (first condition), then is asked to name the color of non-color words written in colored ink (second condition). The third condition elicits what is called the Stroop interference effect, within the subject must name the color of the ink in which the names of various colors are written while ignoring the word. We determined the Stroop Color-Word interference score (Stroop-PI), which is latency for naming all of the colors correctly in this third condition, minus the time required for the second condition.  The ANT is a recent paradigm designed to investigate efficiencies of alerting, orienting and executive control of attention [ 22 ]. The stimuli consist of a row of five visually-presented, white lines, with arrowheads pointing leftward or rightward, against a black background; the target is a leftward or rightward arrowhead at the center. This target is flanked on either side by two arrows pointing in the same direction (congruent condition), by two arrows in the opposite direction (incongruent condition), or by 2 lines (neutral condition). The participant’s task is to indicate the direction of the central target by right- or left- clicking the mouse as quickly as possible. Cues console consists of a 100 ms asterisk presented 400 ms before the target. There were four cue conditions: no cue, central cue which appear at the central fixation point, double-cue in which two warming cues correspond to two possible target positions above and below the central fixation point, and spatial cue which was presented on the exact target localization. The executive effect was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction times (RT) of the condition with congruent flankers from the mean RT of the condition with incongruent flankers. We determine the executive control of attention (ANTc), the median reaction time (ANT-RT), and the percentage of correct answers (ANT%).  The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was used to assess executive processes [ 47 , 48 ]. This task includes four stimulus cards and 128 response cards that contain various figures. The cards vary for color (red, yellow, blue, green), type of figure (crosses, circles, triangles or stars), and number of figures (one to four). The test was discontinued after the completion of six categories or when no more response card remained. The chosen variables were the numbers of perseverative errors (WCST-PE), which reflects the tendency towards perseveration, and the number of categories completed (WCST-NC) given the number of times that 10 consecutive correct responses were made, reflecting overall success.    Genotyping  Four polymorphisms spanning DRD2 and ANKK1 genes, and two polymorphisms encompassing COMT gene were selected on the basis of the previous association with schizophrenia, regarding linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs and genes, genomic localization and minor allele frequencies in the Caucasian population provided by the international Hapmap Project or previously associated with psychiatric disorders. SNPs were genotyped using SNP Taqman assays. For quality control, 40 samples were genotyped in duplicate for all SNPs with 100% of concordance rate. The vulnerability allele or genotype to schizophrenia was made a priori from previous results of the literature.    Statistical analysis  Demographic and clinical characteristics of samples were compared for continuous variables using an univariate analysis of variance (one way ANOVA) and categorical data were analysed using overall Chi-squared (χ 2 ).  We estimated the pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between all the markers by determining D’ and r 2 from unaffected controls using the Haploview 4.1 program [ 49 ] ( S1 Fig ).  The association between SNPs and cognitive performances were tested by one-way ANOVA. First, genetic was the studied factor using the carrier of previous associated allele or genotype versus other, and cognitive performances were in the dependent list. Then, the two investigated factors were the genetics (carrier of previous associated allele or genotype versus other genotype or allele) and the clinical status (participants with schizophrenia versus healthy controls) that were combined to a total of 4 categories. The Levene’s test was carried out to test the homogeneity of the variances between groups. Each cognitive performance was included as dependent variables. Significant main effects of the genotypes were followed up separately in patients and controls.  To determine a significant interaction between genetics and disease on cognitive performances, all participants were included; carried variant (genotype or allele) previously associated to disease and diagnostic were treated as fixed effects in a mixed model (ANOVA by General Linear Model, SPSS, assuming Y = b0 + b1 x X1 + b2 x X2 + b3 x X1 x X2, where Y is the dependent variable, the cognitive test, X1 and X2 the fixed variable, respectively, disorder status and carried -or not- variant). In these analyses, the interaction of disorder and genetics is taking into account in the fitted model and the observed results report the association between the cognitive test and disorder status, carried variant and interaction. In the additive model, for each SNP, each allele was considered to have the same weight.     Results  Demographic characteristics of the sample have been previously described [ 35 ]. Patients were younger than healthy controls (32.65 years (± 9.68) vs 43.77 years (± 12.18) p < 0.0001). There was a higher proportion of women in healthy controls than in patients (64% vs 31%, p < 0.0001). In participants with schizophrenia, the mean age at onset of the disease was 23.1 years (± 6.5), the mean duration of the illness was 7.2 years (± 3.4), the mean chlorpromazine equivalent daily dose was 323.46 mg (± 120.26). Patients had a lower level of education (college or higher education) than the control group (p = 0.0005).  We have previously shown that patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than controls in all cognitive performances, taking into account demographic variables: gender, educational level and age at interview [ 35 ]. The latency of selective attention (Stroop PI) was doubled in patients (33.5 ± 30.7) compared to controls (14.8 ± 4.9) [ 35 ]. The executive control (ANTc) and reaction time (ANT-RT) were significantly increased in patients (203.1 ± 110.3 and 807.5 ± 187.2) compared to controls (152.0 ± 37.0 and 705.0 ± 118.3) [ 35 ]. Patients completed less categories in WCST compared to controls (WCST-NC, 5.4 ± 1.1 vs 5.9 ± 0.5) and made more perseverative errors (WCST-PE, 16.7 ± 12.4 vs 8.7 ± 5.7) [ 35 ].  We examined the possible impact of carrying the vulnerability allele of 4 SNPs in the DRD2 / ANKK1 locus, and 2 SNPs of the COMT gene on cognitive performances in interaction with the disease status. The linkage disequilibrium was important among DRD2 SNPs rs6265, rs6277 and rs2242592 with a D’ of 97 and r 2 of 91 but not for rs1800497 ( S1 Fig ). For COMT SNPs, between rs4680 and rs165599, the D’ was of 71 and the r 2 of 29 ( S1 Fig ). In control group, when we compared the cognitive performances according to the allele, genotype or carrier for each SNP, no significant difference was observed (data not shown). In the patients group, we observed differences in cognitive performances according to genetics. Thus, the performances of all cognitive tests were studied in patients group and also compared between patients and controls, carrying vulnerability allele or genotype versus not, for every SNP of each gene and reported in Tables 1 and 2 (also in S1 and S2 Tables).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170147.t001  Table 1  Association between genetic variants of DRD2 genes and 6 cognitive scores (mean, SD) in 52 schizophrenia patients.

The DRD2/ANKK1 SNPs impact on cognitive functions  The results of selective attention showed a significant impact of the carrier of the vulnerability allele or genotype of the four DRD2/ANKK1 SNPs on Stroop-Interference effect. We found an association with worse performance in Stroop-PI and carriers of vulnerability TT genotype of rs6275 for schizophrenia patients compared to C carriers (63.65 ± 61.72 vs 27.62 ± 17.43, p = 0.002) ( Table 1 ). The mean latencies at Stroop-PI interference score in the schizophrenia group were over two times higher than the control group for each of these vulnerability alleles or genotypes ( S1 Table ). According to the disease and the genetics, we observed a significant difference between patients and controls carrying the TT genotype versus the C allele ( Fig 1 ). Among carriers of the vulnerability C allele of the rs6277, the score in patients was 30.92 ± 22.14 compared to 15 ± 4.98 in controls (p < 0.001) ( S1 Table ). For rs2242592, patients carrying the vulnerability CC genotype performed worse than patients without (53.7 ± 58.09 versus 28.23 ± 17.60, p = 0.019) ( Table 1 ). Patients (31.61 ± 32.52) and healthy controls (14.23 ± 4.61) with the vulnerability C allele of rs1800497 performed better on the Stroop-PI latency than patients (45.83 ± 14.81) and healthy controls (21 ± 6.24) without (p = 0.0003) ( S1 Table ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170147.g001  Fig 1   rs6275 association with Stroop-PI latency score according to carried variant in 52 patients with schizophrenia and 53 healthy controls.     Impact on the Stroop-PI performance of the genotypes of rs6275 in DRD2/ANKK1 in participants. Significant effects of diagnosis, genotypes and their interaction were showed. The genotype effect was observed in patients with schizophrenia, but not in healthy subjects. Patients with schizophrenia showed worse performance in Stroop-PI latency than healthy subjects. Patients carrying of vulnerability C allele showed lower performances than patients with TT genotype.  Performing ANT, patients harboring the vulnerability allele or genotype displayed a greater conflict effect score, a longer ANT-RT and a lower ANT%, as compared to controls ( S1 Table ).  When examining the WCST score, the number of perseverative errors was significantly different between genotype groups ( S1 Table ). In particular, patients carrying the vulnerability allele or genotype made significantly more perseverative errors than controls for the four SNPs (for example, rs6275 16± 11.03 vs 10.5± 8.19 p = 0.0009) ( S1 Table ).    The COMT SNPs impact on cognitive functions  Homozygous patients genotyped Val/Val for rs4680 or carriers of G allele for rs165599 performed worse for the Stroop-PI than patients carrying Met or AA genotype for these SNPs but this was not significantly different (35.54 ±29.60 vs 28.86 ± 17.50, p = 0.37 and 33.92 ±23.76 vs 24.54 ± 17.53, p = 0.25, respectively) ( Table 2 ). No difference was observed in healthy controls according to the carried allele. The main effect of genotypes on selective attention was significant for the Stroop-PI in patients compared to controls ( S2 Table ).  Performance in conflict effect of attention was not statistically significant between groups. However, the ANT-RT was significantly longer and the ANT% was significantly less marked in patients carrying the vulnerability allele or genotype of rs4680 compared to control subjects (p = 0.009 and p = 0.01, respectively). For rs165599, the ANT-RT was also significantly longer and the ANT% significantly lower when subjects carried the G allele as compared with AA homozygotes between groups (p = 0.01 and p = 0.006, respectively) ( S2 Table ).  For WCST, homozygous patients for the Val allele of rs4680 made more perseverative errors (16. 61 ± 14.67) than patients carried Met allele (12.75 ± 5.33) but this was not significantly different (p = 0.22) ( Table 2 ). For rs165599, patients carried G allele made more perseverative errors than subjects genotyped AA (15.19± 10.94 vs 11.73± 5.35 p = 0.33). Genetics of the controls do not influence their performances ( S2 Table ). The main effect of genetics for WCST was significant only for the WCST-PE between groups of patients and controls ( S2 Table ).    Disease by genetics interactions  Because we observed major effects according to the disease status and some effect regarding the allele or genotype of vulnerability in patients on cognitive performances, we also investigated possible interactions between genetics and disease on cognitive performances. We observed a significant interaction between disease and genetics for rs6275 and rs2242592 only for the Stroop-PI performance (p = 0.002 and p = 0.024, respectively) ( Table 3 and S3 Table ). Furthermore, a significant effect of genetics was found for rs6275 and rs2242592 in the DRD2 gene, only on the Stroop-PI ( S3 Table ). Considering an additive model where the effects of each allele were treated as equal, we found significant genetic effects and disorder by genetics interactions ( S4 Table ). The polymorphisms of rs6275, rs2242592 and rs1800497 of the DRD2 gene showed an additive influence on ANT% (p = 0.018, p = 0.017, p = 0.014, respectively) and the disorder by genetics interactions were also significant for these SNPs (p = 0.02, p = 0.022, p = 0.017, respectively). In the same way, rs6277 of the DRD2 gene, rs4680 and rs165599 of the COMT gene showed an additive influence on the WCST-NC (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.019, respectively) and the WCST-PE (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). A disorder by genetics interaction was also significant for rs6277, rs4680 and rs165599 explaining performance on the WCST-NC (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.015, respectively) and the WCST- PE (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.01, respectively).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170147.t003  Table 3  Disorder and genetics interaction on genetic data for cognitive performances to STROOP-PI.

The worst Stroop-PI results were observed in patients with the vulnerability genotype of rs6275 and rs22422592. Interestingly, due to the multiple analyses performed in this study, we carried out a Bonferroni correction, implementing the 6 SNPs and the 6 measures of tests. Corrected p values for rs6275 and rs22422592 remained significant (respectively 0.000004 and 0.0002). These findings suggested that the TT genotype of rs6275 and CC genotype of rs22422592 are associated with a marked deterioration of selective attention and that this effect is more important in participants with schizophrenia. We showed an interaction between schizophrenia and the genetic effect of rs6275 and rs22422592 on Stroop-PI, but the effect of the disease appears to be more prominent.  Patients harboring the vulnerability TT genotype of rs6275 were less efficient than controls on the executive control of the Attention Network Test scores (ANTc, ANT-RT and ANT%). They took a longer time to resolve conflict and showed a lower percentage of correct answers than control subjects. We previously found that the ANT-RT may be a possible endophenotype marker for schizophrenia [ 35 ]. Considering an additive model where the two alleles have the same influence, we found only a significant illness by genetics interaction influencing the percentage of correct answers (ANT%) reinforcing the potential role of the TT genotype instead of carrier of one T allele only. In this study, rs6275 SNPs interacted with schizophrenia on attention performances. Carrying the vulnerability TT genotype of rs6275 is associated with a decline in executive functions compared to controls as indicated also by the great number of perseverative errors of WCST.  All together, these data suggest that rs6275 affects executive and attentional performance, specifically in schizophrenia. This is consistent with previous studies supporting the association between rs6275 and schizophrenia [ 50 , 51 ]. Although the association between rs6275 and susceptibility to schizophrenia is documented, this research is the first, to our knowledge, to investigate their interaction with attention and executive functions.  Contrary to healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia who carry the vulnerability C allele of rs6277 perform worse in perseverative errors than patients without ( Table 1 ). The current results are in line with a previous study in healthy volunteers [ 36 ]. Regarding executive functions, the C allele of rs6277 modulates this effect according to illness status. Considering rs1800497 of the DRD2/ANKK1 locus, impaired selective attention (assessed by Stroop-PI) is associated with schizophrenia more than genetics. Using the additive model, we found a significant interaction between schizophrenia and the C allele of rs1800497 on the percentage of correct answers (ANT%). Carrying this allele increases conflict especially in schizophrenia patients. We had previously found that SNPs rs1800497, rs2242592 and rs6277 were significantly associated with susceptibility for schizophrenia [ 7 ]. Each of them has probably no direct effect on attention but they act via the disease status.    COMT gene, cognitive tasks and schizophrenia  In this work, patients have scored significantly worse on neuropsychological tests of executive cognition, but we have failed to find any association with the COMT polymorphisms when the vulnerability alleles were considered as dominant (genotype Val/Val for rs4680 and G allele for rs165599). The additive pattern raises the sample size and enhances the significance.  For rs4680 and the number of perseverative errors, there is a discrepancy between patients and healthy controls. Contrary to healthy controls, patients carrying the Val/Val genotype have performed worse than the carriers of Met allele. We found that higher loading of the COMT 158 Met allele was associated with better neurocognitive performance among individuals with chronic schizophrenia, consistent with and extending the findings from prior studies [ 28 , 52 ]. Bilder et al. [ 52 ] did not find any association between the homozygous patients Val/Val and the executive function (WCST), but a significant genotype effect was observed on Processing Speed and Attention. Moreover, in this last study, the sample size was relatively small, participants had a long duration of illness (more than 17 years), and no healthy controls was included. Egan and colleagues have display that Val/Val subject have the poorest performance [ 28 ]. Disease status seems to modulate the action of COMT genotype on executive cognition.  For rs165599, the G allele is associated with worse STROOP-PI performances and a decrease level of performance on the perseverative errors of executive cognition. This effect could be link with schizophrenia.  In current sample, COMT genotypes are associated with executive cognition and this effect is related to schizophrenia diagnosis. Observed effects of COMT Val158Met genotype showed either a relative advantage or disadvantage on cognitive functions, in healthy controls and in diseases (for review [ 53 ]). These effects are dependent on the dopaminergic neurotransmission charge in subjects. Thus, the Met allele reduces the dopamine degradation which presents a benefit, compared to Val allele, for cognitive function in healthy controls and in schizophrenic patients (for review [ 53 ]).  We did not replicate the previously observed association of COMT SNPs with executive control of attention. Our results are in contradiction with those of Opgen-Rhein et al. [ 54 ] who have reported reduced conflict effect in a group of schizophrenia patients where the Met allele carriers showed significantly higher frequency. It should be mentioned that this last work included only male participants, with a greater mean RT, which is associated with a higher conflict effect. This may explain the discrepancy in the results.  The main strengths of the present study are: (1) the homogeneity of the clinical characteristics of participants with schizophrenia which is an important criteria for genetic studies of complex disorders, (2) the short duration of illness and (3) the treatment with antipsychotic medications known to preserve cognitive functions. Furthermore, a large number of cognitive tests have been used and our results are in line with the literature. This homogenous group of outpatients with schizophrenia displayed an overall deficit compared to controls in executive functions measured using the ANT, WCST and Stroop tests after adjusting for demographic characteristic (i.e. sex ratio, years of education age at interview). This suggested that the deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia could be attributed directly to the illness, rather than to these variables that might affect cognition performances. The limitation of this work is the sample size, which may affect the statistical power to detect minor effect especially for genetics. However, our size of sample for patients and healthy controls is higher in this work compared to the previous studies of cognitive tasks in schizophrenia and we included the genetic analysis. Furthermore, a larger cohort would be useful to analyze the effect of carrying one or two vulnerability alleles. Then, our results need to be replicated in a greater sample.     Conclusions  In our sample, schizophrenia and genetics interact on the executive control of attention, mostly on Stroop-PI and slightly on ANT. Rs6275, rs2242592 and rs1800497 of the DRD2 increased the conflict while COMT SNPs do not. Regarding executive cognition, the COMT and schizophrenia also interact.  The anterior cingulate cortex is activated by the conflict effect [ 24 ] and by the selective attention [ 55 ]. The executive component of cognition is related to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This is in accordance with Egan and colleagues [ 28 ] who suggest an impaired prefrontal cognition in schizophrenia. These results suggest that the DRD2 SNPs may modulate the anterior cingulate cortex function while the COMT SNPs may have neurobiological effects specific to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are proposed to regulate starvation-induced autophagy by directly interacting with Beclin 1. Beclin 1 is also thought to be involved in multiple vesicle trafficking pathways such as endocytosis by binding to Atg14L and UVRAG. However, how the interaction of Bcl-2 family proteins and Beclin 1 regulates anti-bacterial autophagy (xenophagy) is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed these interactions using Group A Streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes ) infection as a model. GAS is internalized into epithelial cells through endocytosis, while the intracellular fate of GAS is degradation by autophagy. Here, we found that Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2 regulates GAS-induced autophagy. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion and the internalization process during GAS infection were promoted in Bcl-xL knockout cells. In addition, knockout of Beclin 1 phenocopied the internalization defect of GAS. Furthermore, UVRAG interacts not only with Beclin 1 but also with Bcl-xL, and overexpression of UVRAG partially rescued the internalization defect of Beclin 1 knockout cells during GAS infection. Thus, our results indicate that Bcl-xL inhibits GAS-induced autophagy directly by suppressing autophagosome-lysosome fusion and indirectly by suppressing GAS internalization via interaction with Beclin 1-UVRAG.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  Japan Society for the Promotion of Science    JP25293370   Ichiro Nakagawa        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  Japan Society for the Promotion of Science    JP16K08775   Chihiro Aikawa        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  Japan Society for the Promotion of Science    JP16H05188   Ichiro Nakagawa     Support was provided by JSPS KAKENHI JP25293370, JP16K08775 and JP16H05188 [ https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-grantsinaid/index.html ].

GAS can adhere to and invade epithelial cells through endocytosis. As a result, host cells have developed the several molecular mechanisms to eliminate the invading bacterium such as autophagy, an intracellular degradation system and apoptosis for removing infected cells themselves. For example, apoptosis in response to GAS internalization is triggered by actin rearrangement and small GTPase Rac1-mediated ROS production and prevents the spread of GAS infection through programmed suicide [ 2 , 3 ], and this apoptotic cell death is inhibited by the overexpression of Bcl-2 [ 2 ]. In addition, after internalization, GAS escapes from endosomes into the cytoplasm by disrupting the endosomal membrane by way of the secreted hemolytic enzyme streptolysin O (SLO) [ 4 ], however, cytoplasmic GAS is targeted and destroyed by autophagy [ 5 ]. GAS strains are classified under serotypes associated with human disease. Strain JRS4 is a serotype M6 clone of GAS and is degraded by autophagy efficiently, so this infection model is widely used to prove the induction mechanism of GAS-induced selective autophagy. However, GAS JRS4 is not representative of all GAS strains because it is much less prevalent associated with human disease [ 6 ]. Recently, Barnett et al. reported that the globally disseminated serotype M1T1 clone of GAS (strain 5448) can avoid autophagy pathway [ 7 ].  Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL attenuate apoptosis either by sequestering proforms of death-driving cysteine proteases, called caspases, or by preventing the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors including calcium, cytochrome c, and AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) into the cytoplasm [ 8 ]. In addition to anti-apoptotic function, accumulating evidence has demonstrated the multiple roles of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by showing their effects on intracellular trafficking including on endocytic and autophagic processes. These proteins are involved in vesicle trafficking by interacting with various trafficking related proteins including calnexin, Rab7, and vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) 3 [ 9 ], and in autophagy by reducing the pro-autophagic activity of Beclin 1 [ 10 , 11 ].  Autophagy, a highly conserved intracellular protein-degradation system required for cellular homeostasis, provides an important intracellular immune system against invading bacteria such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S . typhimurium ) [ 12 ], Listeria monocytogenes [ 13 , 14 ], and Shigella flexneri [ 15 ]. These anti-bacterial autophagic responses are called xenophagy. Although anti-bacterial autophagy has common fundamental machinery with starvation-induced autophagy, such as the dependence on Atg5 and LC3 (mammalian homolog of Atg8 in yeast), its regulation mechanisms may be largely distinct from starvation-induced autophagy.  Beclin 1, the mammalian ortholog of Atg6/vacuolar sorting protein (Vps) 30 in yeast, is a Bcl-2-homology (BH)-3 domain only protein and was first discovered as a Bcl-2-interacting protein [ 16 ]. Beclin 1 associates with the class III type phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3KC3)/Vps34. This PI3KC3 produces a pool of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is crucial for the nucleation of autophagosome formation [ 17 ]. While Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit the autophagic response by suppressing the activity of Beclin 1 [ 10 , 11 ], other Beclin 1 binding molecules including the activating molecule in Beclin 1-regulated autophagy (Ambra1), UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein (UVRAG), and Atg14L, positively stimulate starvation-induced autophagy [ 18 – 21 ]. In addition, the UVRAG/Vps38-associating Beclin 1-PI3KC3 complex is also thought to be involved in multiple vesicle trafficking pathways including endocytosis and vacuolar protein sorting as well as autophagy [ 22 – 25 ].  Although possible or definite involvement of Bcl-2 and/or the Bcl-xL-Beclin 1 complex in starvation-induced autophagy and endocytic process has been demonstrated, its precise roles in internalization and autophagy during bacterial infection remain unclear. In this paper, we show the involvement of Bcl-xL, Beclin 1, and UVRAG in GAS-induced autophagy. Knockout of Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2 promotes the uptake of GAS by endocytosis, consequently leading to the promotion of GAS containing autophagosome-like vesicle (GcAV) formation. Of note, endogenous Bcl-xL also regulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion during GAS infection. Knockout of Beclin 1 also shows inhibitory function in the internalization of GAS. UVRAG can bind not only to Beclin 1 but also to Bcl-xL, and overexpression of UVRAG partially rescues the defective internalization of GAS in Beclin 1 knockout (KO) cells.    Materials and Methods   Cell culture and transfection  HeLa and HEK293T cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 50 μg/mL gentamicin (Nacalai Tesque) in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C. To induce starvation, cells were incubated in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS(-), Nacalai Tesque) without serum for 2 h. Plasmid transfections were performed using polyethylenimine (Polyscience), Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen), or Xfect (Clontech), according to the manufacturers’ protocols.    Group A Streptococcus strain  Group A Streptococcus (GAS) strain JRS4 (M6 + F1 + ) was grown in Todd–Hewitt broth (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (THY), as described previously [ 5 ].    Plasmid construction  Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen) was used to create the vectors indicated below. Human Bcl-2 (GenBank Accession No. NM_000633.2), Bcl-xL (GenBank Accession No. NM_138578.2), Beclin 1 (GenBank Accession No. NM_003766.4), Atg14 (GenBank Accession No. NM_014924.4), and UVRAG protein cDNA (GenBank Accession No. NM_003369.3) were amplified by PCR from human cDNA libraries using the following primer pairs: Bcl-2_F, 5′-CACCATGGCGCACGCTGGGAGAACAGGGTACGAT-3′ , and Bcl-2_R, 5′-TGACTTCACTTGTGGCCCAGATAGGCACCC -3′ ; Bcl-xL_F, 5′-CACCATGTCTCAGAGCAACCGGGAGCTGGTGGTT-3′ , and Bcl-xL_R, 5′-TGGTCATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGAGCCCAG-3′ ; Beclin 1_F, 5′-CACCATGGAAGGGTCTAAGACGTCCAACAACAGC-3′ , and Beclin 1_R, 5′-TCATTTGTTATAAAATTGTGAGGACACCCA-3′ ; Atg14_F, 5′-CACCATGGCGTCTCCCAGTGGGAAGGGAGCCCGG-3′ , and Atg14_R, 5′-TTAACGGTGTCCAGTGTAAGCTTTAAACCA-3′ ; UVRAG_F, 5′-CACCATGAGCGCCTCCGCGTCGGTCGGGGGCCCC-3′ , and UVRAG_R, 5′-TCACTTATCGGAACTCCTGCGCGGCCGGCG-3′ . These PCR products were cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector using the pENTR Directional TOPO Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and subcloned into the pcDNA-6.2/N-3xFLAG-DEST, pcDNA6.2/N-EmGFP-DEST, and pcDNA6.2/N-mCherry-DEST vectors. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against Atg14 ( 5′-CCACUGCAUACCCUCAGGAAUCUAA-3′ ; stealth RNAi ™ siRNA, Invitrogen) and non-specific scrambled siRNA (Invitrogen) were used for silencing experiments.    Antibodies and other reagents  The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl-xL (54H6) (Cell Signaling Technology, 2764), rabbit polyclonal anti-Atg14 (Sigma-Aldrich, A6358), mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T6199), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804), mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (GF200) (Nacalai Tesque, 04363–24), rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3B (Sigma-Aldrich, L7543), mouse monoclonal anti-LAMP1 (Santa Cruz, sc-20011), rabbit polyclonal anti-Beclin 1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 3738), rabbit polyclonal anti-Atg5 (D1G9) (Cell Signaling Technology, 8540), rabbit polyclonal anti-Atg7 (D12B11) (Cell Signaling Technology, 8558), and mouse monoclonal anti-Galectin-3 (BD Biosciences, 556904). The secondary antibodies used for immunoblotting were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). The fluorescent secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen), or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen).    Bacterial infection  Infections with GAS were performed as described previously [ 5 ]. GAS grown through mid-log phase was added to cell cultures at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100, without antibiotics. After 1 h, infected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then 10% DMEM/FBS with antibiotics (100 μg/mL gentamicin) was added for an appropriate period to eliminate extracellular bacteria. The cells were further cultured for the indicated times.    Fluorescence microscopy  For immunostaining experiments, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and then incubated in skim milk blocking buffer (5% skim milk, 2.5% goat serum, 2.5% donkey serum, and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS containing 0.1% gelatin) or BSA blocking solution (2% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted with blocking solution at 4°C overnight, washed with PBS, and then probed with secondary antibodies. Bacterial and cellular DNAs were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Dojindo) in PBS. All fluorescence confocal microscopy images shown here were acquired with an FV1000 laser-scanning microscope (Olympus).    Bacterial viability assays  Cells were cultured in 24-well culture plates and infected as described in “Bacterial infection.” After an appropriate incubation time, infected cells were washed with PBS. Infected cells were lysed in distilled water, serial dilutions of the lysates were plated on THY agar (3% Todd Hewitt Broth, 0.2% yeast extract, and 1.5% agar) plates, and colony counting was performed. The data are presented as the ratio of “intracellular live GAS at 4 h post-infection” to “total intracellular GAS at 2 h post-infection”, and “total intracellular GAS at 2 h post-infection” to “total attached GAS at 0.5 or 1 h post-infection”.    Generation of knockout lines using CRISPR/Cas9  CRISPR/Cas9 [ 26 ] was used to knockout Beclin 1, Atg5, Atg7 or Bcl-xL as described previously [ 27 ]. CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs) were chosen that targeted an exon common to all splicing variants of the gene of interest (target sequence; Beclin 1, 5’- TCCAACAACAGCACCATGC-3’ , Atg5, 5’-ATCAAGTTCAGCTCTTCCT-3’ , Atg7, 5’-GCCCCTTTTAGTAGTGCCT-3’ , Bcl-xL, 5’- AGACCCCCAGTGCCATCAA-3’ ). For CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, HeLa cells were transfected with a gRNA-hyg vector containing the CRISPR target sequence and hCAS9 vector (Addgene 41815). Two days after transfection, untransfected cells were removed by selection with 300 μg/mL hygromycin B (Nacalai Tesque) and 750 μg/mL geneticin (G418) (Nacalai Tesque). Single colonies were expanded into 24-well plates, and depletion of the targeted gene was confirmed by immunoblotting. As a secondary screen of some knockout lines, genomic DNA was isolated from cells and the genomic regions were amplified using PCR. These PCR products were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired frameshift insertions and deletions.    Generation of stable cell lines  Stable cell lines were generated by retroviral expression as previously described [ 28 ]. Plat-E cells (kindly provided by T. Kitamura, The University of Tokyo) were transiently transfected using FuGENE HD Reagent with constructs based on pBABE-puro (Addgene, 1764) and cultured for 48 h. The resulting retrovirus containing supernatant was collected, and used to infect HeLa cells. Uninfected cells were removed by selection with 2 μg/mL puromycin (Invitrogen).  Additionally, for constructs based on pLenti6/V5-DEST, the virus was produced using the ViraPower lentiviral expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 293 FT cells were cotransfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with pLenti-mCherry-EmGFP-LC3 and the mixture of the packaging plasmids (Invitrogen), and cultured for 48 h. The viral supernatant was collected, and used to infect HeLa cells. After 24 h, uninfected cells were removed by selection on 5 μg/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen).    Immunoprecipitation  Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 5 μM ZnCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Tesque) for 30 min at 4°C. Lysates were then centrifuged, and obtained supernatants were pre-cleared by incubating with Protein G Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for 1 h at 4°C. After brief centrifugation, the supernatants were reacted with anti-FLAG antibodies at 4°C overnight, and then Protein G Sepharose beads were added and allowed to react (with rotation) for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by brief centrifugation, and the mixtures were washed 5 times with wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and analyzed by immunoblotting.    Statistical analysis  Co-localization and GcAV formation was quantified through direct visualization in a confocal microscope. Unless otherwise indicated, at least 50 GcAVs or 200 GAS-infected cells were counted per treatment in each experiment. At least three independent experiments were performed for each trial. Unless otherwise indicated, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) is shown. Data were tested by two-tailed Student’s t -test. P values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance, and are marked * for P < 0.05, ** for P < 0.01, and n.s. for not significant.     Results   Effect of Bcl-xL on GAS internalization  Initially, to confirm the inhibitory function of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in starvation-induced autophagy, HeLa cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein-fused LC3 (GFP-LC3) were transfected with either empty FLAG control vector (FLAG-Control), FLAG-Bcl-2, or FLAG-Bcl-xL, and the number of lipid-conjugated forms of LC3 (LC3-II) puncta were counted under starvation conditions. LC3 puncta formation was inhibited in cells expressing both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL under starvation conditions ( S1A and S1B Fig ). Notably, starvation-induced LC3 puncta formation was more suppressed in cells expressing Bcl-xL than those expressing Bcl-2. Similarly, western blotting analysis showed that the conversion ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I in both Bcl-2- and Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells was lower than that of cells transfected with control vector after a 2 h starvation period ( S1C Fig ). From these results, we could verify the inhibitory function of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in starvation-induced autophagy.  Next, we assessed the role of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in GAS infection. Unlike under starvation conditions, the rate of GcAV formation was reduced in cells transfected with Bcl-xL, but not in those transfected with Bcl-2 ( Fig 1A and 1B ). Consistent with this, less accumulation of LC3-II was observed in cells transfected with Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2 during GAS infection ( Fig 1C ). On the other hand, the co-localization efficiency of LAMP1, a lysosomal membranes marker, with GcAV was not affected, and the intracellular survival rate of GAS was slightly decreased in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells compared to that of the control vector-transfected cells ( Fig 1D, 1E and 1F ). To clarify the reason of decrease in GcAV formation in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells, we evaluated the cell-internalization ability of GAS in control vector or Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells. Of note, overexpression of Bcl-xL resulted in the significant reduction (43%) in the number of invading GAS ( Fig 1G ). To further assess the correlation between internalization and autophagosome formation, we used Galectin-3, a marker of damaged endomembranes [ 29 ]. The percentage of Galectin-3-positive GAS in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells decreased by 15% compared with that of the control vector-transfected cells ( Fig 1H and 1I ). However, LC3 recruitment to Galectin-3-poisitve GAS was not affected in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells compared with the control vector-transfected cells ( Fig 1J and 1K ). Therefore, our data suggests that a decreased number of internalized GAS in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells is responsible for the reduction in autophagic LC3 activity (GcAV formation and recruitment to endosomes), and that overexpression of Bcl-xL is not invariably involved in the fusion of GcAV with lysosomes, which eventually degrades GAS.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170138.g001  Fig 1   Bcl-xL suppresses GAS internalization.

Lack of Bcl-xL promotes GAS internalization and autophagosome-lysosome fusion  In Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells, Bcl-xL is suggested to regulate starvation-induced autophagy and internalization pathway of GAS. Next, we established a Bcl-xL KO HeLa cell line by genome editing ( S2A and S2B Fig ) and evaluated the role of endogenous Bcl-xL. Under starvation conditions, the number of LC3 puncta was increased approximately twofold in Bcl-xL KO cells compared to that of wild-type cells ( S2C and S2D Fig ). Interestingly, an increase of LC3 puncta was observed under not only starvation conditions but also nutrient-rich conditions. Consistent with this result, although the accumulation of LC3-II was observed in both cell-lines after a 2 h starvation period, the LC3-II levels of Bcl-xL KO cells under nutrient conditions seemed to be higher compared with that of wild-type cells ( S2E Fig ). These results suggest that endogenous Bcl-xL regulates either autophagosome formation or maturation, under both starvation and basal conditions.  Next, we assessed the influence of Bcl-xL on cell internalization and autophagy in GAS infection. The internalization rate of GAS in Bcl-xL KO cells increased approximately twofold in comparison with wild-type cells after infection ( Fig 2A ). The efficiency of formation of GcAV-positive cells in Bcl-xL KO cells was approximately 1.35-fold higher during infection compared with that of the wild-type cells ( Fig 2B ). In addition, the number of GcAVs per cell in Bcl-xL KO cells increased approximately 1.34-fold compared with that of the wild-type cells ( Fig 2C and 2D ). Similarly, LC-II levels in Bcl-xL KO cells were higher than that in wild-type cells during GAS infection ( Fig 2E ). The percentage of Galectin-3-positive GAS in Bcl-xL KO cells was about 2.32-fold higher than that in wild-type cells at 1 h post-infection, while there was no difference between wild-type and Bcl-xL KO cells at 2 and 4 h post-infection ( Fig 2F and 2G ). On the other hand, LC3 recruitment to Galectin-3-poisitve GAS was not different between wild-type and Bcl-xL KO cells ( Fig 2H and 2I ). These results indicate that endogenous Bcl-xL indirectly regulates GcAV formation by inhibiting GAS internalization, but does not affect LC3 recruitment to damaged GAS-containing endosomes. Next, to examine the influence of Bcl-xL on the autophagosome-lysosome fusion, we observed co-localization of LAMP1 with GcAV at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post infection. The rates of LAMP1-positive GcAV in Bcl-xL KO cells were higher than those in wild-type cells at all time points of infection ( Fig 2J and 2K ), suggesting that the promotion of GcAV-lysosome fusion in Bcl-xL KO cells dose not only reflect the increased number of invaded GAS. In addition, no significant difference was observed, but the survival rate of GAS in Bcl-xL KO cells reduced by approximately 3% compared with that in wild-type cells ( Fig 2L ) despite an excessive increase in the number of invading GAS ( Fig 2A ). These results suggest that endogenous Bcl-xL suppresses GAS-induced autophagy by inhibiting not only the GAS internalization process indirectly but also the autophagosome-lysosome fusion.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170138.g002  Fig 2   Endogenous Bcl-xL regulates GAS internalization and autophagosome-lysosome fusion during GAS infection.

The data presents the survival rate as the ratio of “intracellular live GAS at 4 h post-infection” to “total intracellular GAS at 2 h post-infection”. Data are representative of ≥three independent experiments.       Knockout of Beclin 1 inhibits GAS internalization  Bcl-xL is known to interact with Beclin 1 (also confirmed in S3A Fig ) and to reduce the pro-autophagy activity of Beclin 1-PI3KC3, a crucial complex for the nucleation of autophagosome formation under starvation conditions [ 10 , 11 ]. We established Beclin 1 KO HeLa cells ( S3B and S3C Fig ) and initially evaluated the role of endogenous Beclin 1 under starvation conditions. We confirmed the attenuation of starvation-induced autophagic activity by showing the reduction in LC3 puncta formation and LC3-II levels ( S3D, S3E and S3F Fig ) in Beclin 1 KO cells. These results were not inconsistent with that of a previous study [ 30 ].  Beclin 1 is also suggested to be involved in endocytosis [ 31 – 35 ]. To examine whether the inhibitory function of Bcl-xL in the internalization process of GAS is mediated through the Beclin 1 activation, we evaluated the role of endogenous Beclin 1 under GAS infection. The internalization rate of GAS in Beclin 1 KO cells decreased by approximately one fifth in comparison with that of wild-type cells ( Fig 3A ). To further investigate the involvement of other autophagy essential components on GAS internalization, we examined the internalization ability of GAS in Atg5 and Atg7 KO cells established by CRISPR/Cas9 system ( S3G Fig ). There was no significant difference in the GAS internalization between wild-type, Atg5 and Atg7 KO cells ( S3H Fig ), suggesting that the internalization defect of GAS in Beclin 1 KO cells is not a result of defect of autophagy process. In addition, the LC3 recruitment to damaged endosomes containing GAS (Galectin-3-poisitve GAS) was suppressed in Beclin 1 KO cells at 2 and 4 h post-infection in comparison with that of wild-type cells ( Fig 3B and 3C ). However, LC3 recruitment to Galectin-3-poisitve GAS was not different between wild-type and Beclin 1 KO cells ( Fig 3D and 3E ). From these results, we expected that a decrease in the number of invading GAS in Beclin 1 KO cells might subsequently result in downregulation of both GcAV formation and LC3-II levels. However, deletion of Beclin 1 did not affect GcAV formation and LC3-II levels ( Fig 3F, 3G and 3H ). In addition, the rate of LAMP1-positive GcAV and the survival rate of intracellular GAS were almost the same between wild-type and Beclin 1 KO cells ( Fig 3I, 3J and 3K ). Taken together, these results suggest that endogenous Beclin 1 partially phonocopies the defective internalization process of GAS observed in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells, and that Beclin 1 is dispensable for Bcl-xL-mediated regulation of GcAV formation and GcAV-lysosome fusion.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170138.g003  Fig 3   Knockout of Beclin 1 inhibits GAS internalization.

Bcl-xL-Beclin 1-UVRAG regulates GAS internalization  Finally, we investigated the involvement of Atg14L and UVRAG in the internalization process and autophagy during GAS infection, because both proteins are shown to positively stimulate starvation-induced autophagy [ 18 – 21 ] and also to regulate the endocytic process through their interaction with Beclin 1 [ 22 – 25 , 36 ]. In Atg14L knockdown cells ( S4A Fig ), LC3 puncta formation was suppressed under starvation conditions ( S4B and S4C Fig ), but GcAV formation was not affected during GAS infection ( Fig 4A and 4B ). In addition, both the internalization and intracellular survival rate of GAS in Atg14L knockdown cells was almost the same as those of the control cells ( Fig 4C and 4D ). These results suggest that Atg14L is required for LC3 formation during starvation, but is not involved in the internalization process and GcAV formation during GAS infection. Immunoprecipitation assay showed the direct interaction of UVRAG with Bcl-xL ( Fig 4E ). A decrease in the number of invading GAS in Beclin 1 KO cells was partially rescued by overexpression of UVRAG ( Fig 4F and 4G ), suggesting that Bcl-xL-Beclin 1-UVRAG regulates GAS internalization.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170138.g004  Fig 4   UVRAG but not Atg14 regulates GAS internalization.

Discussion  Intracellular infection provides a nutritionally rich environment, in which bacterial pathogens are protected from various elements of the host immune system including phagocytes, antibacterial peptides, humoral antibodies, and antibiotics [ 37 ]. Although, in many cases, cell-invading bacterial pathogens are efficiently eliminated by host defense mechanisms with phagosomes, GAS can survive either within phagosomes of phagocytic cells or within endosomes of epithelial cells [ 1 ]. While the beneficial effects of endocytosis-mediated internalization for GAS have been shown, host cells have developed several molecular mechanisms to eliminate the invading GAS such as bactericidal ROS generation, autophagic degradation, and apoptosis for removing infected cells by programmed suicide [ 2 , 3 , 5 ].  The host cell internalization of GAS is mediated by its surface proteins such as M proteins and fibronectin-binding proteins [ 38 , 39 ], both of which bind fibronectin and activate PI3K. The activation of PI3K catalyzes phosphorylation of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol, which binds to downstream targets including integrin-linked kinase (ILK) [ 40 ]. ILK can indirectly activate the small GTPases Rac, and Cdc42, which in turn can regulate actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the internalization of GAS into endosomes [ 41 ]. The Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-Beclin 1-PI3K complex, a regulator of starvation-induced autophagy, is also considered to be involved in other vesicle trafficking process such as endocytosis, however, its role in GAS internalization and anti-bacterial autophagy remains unclear.  It has been clearly demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can inhibit autophagy by binding to Beclin 1 and blocking its function [ 11 , 42 , 43 ]. In this study, we also confirmed the inhibitory function of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in starvation-induced autophagosome formation. On the other hand, in GAS infection, we showed that Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2 regulated GcAV formation and that it is attributed to the number of internalized GAS. In addition, Bcl-xL also regulated GcAV-lysosome fusion, which consequently affects the intracellular survival of GAS. Overall, these results suggest that Bcl-xL inhibits GAS-induced autophagy directly by inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and indirectly by suppressing the GAS internalization. However, from our results, another question arises: why is Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2 related to the internalization process and autophagy during GAS infection? In this regard, previous studies have shown that Bcl-2 at the ER but not at the mitochondria inhibits starvation-induced autophagy [ 11 ], because production of PtdIns3P by ER-localized PI3KC3 may become the initiation signal for autophagosome formation [ 17 ]. On the other hand, Bcl-xL can also localize to both mitochondria and the ER, and it associates with Beclin 1 within mitochondria via its BH3 domain [ 44 ]. Although further studies are warranted to determine the activation site of Bcl-xL and/or the binding site of Bcl-xL-Beclin 1 during GAS infection, our data indicate that Bcl-xL may have a differential role among starvation-induced autophagy, GAS internalization, and GAS-induced autophagy as compared with Bcl-2.  Many studies have shown a central role for Beclin 1 in regulating autophagy [ 32 , 45 , 46 ], but its distinct role in other vesicle trafficking including endocytosis is not fully understood. There are some arguments for and against the endocytic role of Beclin 1 [ 31 – 35 ]. In addition, the direct participation of Beclin 1 in the regulation of autophagy and endocytosis-mediated internalization during bacterial infection has not been elucidated. Furthermore, as Bcl-xL regulated the internalization events in GAS infected cells, we assumed that Beclin 1, as a binding partner of Bcl-xL and a central component of the PI3KC3 complex should also mediate such processes. In Beclin 1 KO cells, a significant inhibition of autophagosome (LC3 puncta) formation and a slight decrease in LC3-II levels were observed under starvation conditions, which is mostly consistent with previous studies showing Beclin 1 is required for the recruitment of lipidated LC3 to autophagosomes but not invariably for LC3 lipidation [ 47 ]. By contrast, knockout of Beclin 1 resulted in a reduction in the number of internalized GAS. On the other hand, the rate of GcAV formation and the co-localization efficiency of lysosomes with GcAVs in Beclin 1 KO cells were almost same as that of wild-type cells. Therefore, Beclin 1 might function as an important regulator of GAS internalization with Bcl-xL, but it is dispensable for the Bcl-xL-mediated regulation of GAS-induced autophagy. Further studies are warranted to determine molecules regulating anti-bacterial autophagy with Bcl-xL.  Finally, we showed that the function of Beclin 1 in the GAS internalization process depended on its interaction with UVRAG, but not with Atg14L. In mammalian cells, Atg14L is required to recruit PI3KC3 to the formation site of autophagosomes [ 48 ]. Atg14L is traditionally considered to be an autophagy specific factor, but a recent study shows that it may be involved in the regulation of endocytosis [ 36 ]. Despite a clear contribution of Atg14L in autophagosome formation under starvation conditions, knockdown of Atg14L did not affect GcAV formation or the internalization of GAS. In contrast, defective internalization of GAS in Beclin 1 KO cells was partially rescued by overexpression of UVRAG. Interestingly, UVRAG could directly associate with Bcl-xL as well as Beclin 1. It has been shown that UVRAG promotes endocytic trafficking [ 25 , 49 – 51 ]. In addition, crystal structure analysis of Beclin 1 suggests that the coiled-coil domain interaction between Beclin 1 and UVRAG has a higher affinity than that of Beclin 1 and Atg14L under normal conditions [ 52 ]. Therefore, Beclin 1 may use distinct Beclin 1 complexes depending on intra- and extracellular environmental changes such as starvation and bacterial infection and Beclin 1-UVRAG but not Beclin 1-Atg14 functions in the internalization process of GAS.  In summary, our data show that anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL inhibits GAS-induced autophagy directly by inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and indirectly by suppressing the GAS internalization through its interaction with Beclin 1-UVRAG. Our study expands our view of the biological function of the Bcl-xL-Beclin 1-UVRAG complex in the bacterial cell internalization process and anti-bacterial autophagy, which may ultimately contribute to the kinetics of intracellular bacteria, and will allow us to explore ways to manipulate the functions for potentially therapeutic purposes in infectious diseases by invading bacteria.

To assess the possible impact of transgenic poplar plantations on the ecosystem, we analyzed the frequency and distance of gene flow from a mature male transgenic Populus nigra plantation carrying the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin gene ( Bt poplar) and the survival of Bt poplar seeds. The resultant Bt poplar seeds occurred at a frequency of ~0.15% at 0 m to ~0.02% at 500 m from the Bt poplar plantation. The germination of Bt poplar seeds diminished within three weeks in the field (germination rate from 68% to 0%) compared to 48% after three weeks of storage at 4°C. The survival rate of seedlings in the field was 0% without any treatment but increased to 1.7% under the addition of four treatments (cleaning and trimming, watering, weeding, and covering with plastic film to maintain moisture) after being seeded in the field for eight weeks. The results of this study indicate that gene flow originating from the Bt poplar plantation occurred at an extremely low level through pollen or seeds under natural conditions. This study provides first-hand field data on the extent of transgene flow in poplar plantations and offers guidance for the risk assessment of transgenic poplar plantations.

Although gene flow is a very common natural phenomenon and an important process for evolution, the movement of transgenes from genetic modified plants to wild related populations may be considered undesirable and lead to undesirable environmental consequences, such as more aggressive weeds, germplasm loss, or increased non-target organism and biodiversity losses.  As long-lived plants, trees are exposed to the environment over a much longer time period than are annual crops [ 1 , 2 ]. Poplar, as a fast-growing tree with 8–15 years in rotation, has been used for genetic transformation for both research and breeding [ 3 , 4 ]. Cross-pollination of poplars in plantations with their wild relatives is of major concern due to the broad compatibility within and among species, even those belonging to different sections of Populus [ 5 ]. Several modeling and simulation methods have been proposed to measure the gene flow between poplar stands [ 6 , 7 ], and co-dominant markers have been developed to monitor gene flow among species, even those belonging to different sections [ 8 ]. However, no empirical data on transgenic poplar plantations are available to address this issue.  Poplars play important roles in afforestation and timber supply worldwide. In China, approximately 7 million hm 2 of poplar plantations have been established for shelterbelt and timber production [ 9 ]. However, insects create severe damage to the plantations and cause an estimated annual loss of millions of US dollars. The infected trees are usually sprayed with pesticide or cut down in order to control the infestation, resulting in serious economic and ecological consequences [ 10 ]. Genetic engineering provides a promising tool for breeding superior poplar clones with improved tolerance to insects, drought, and/or wood properties. For example, insect-tolerant transgenic Populus nigra with the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin ( Bt ) gene was planted for a field test in 1994 and proved effective in avoiding leaf-insect damage [ 11 ].  To date, transgenic poplars are not only released in field trials but also planted as a commercial crop in plantation forestry [ 12 ]. To develop poplars that were more tolerant to insect attacks, Populus nigra trees were transformed with cry1Ac in 1993 and have been field tested since 1994. Bt poplars were first commercialized in 2001 and occupied 490 ha in China up through 2014. Transgenic poplar plantations have effectively inhibited the fast spread of target insect pests and have significantly reduced the number of required insecticide applications [ 12 ].  In China, transgenic poplars are mainly planted in the northern areas where the climate is dry or semidry with an average precipitation from 100 to 600 mm concentrated in July and August. Poplar seed dispersal occurs from May to June and thus misses the rain season for favorable seed germination. Indeed, the successful establishment of a poplar plantation in these areas depends on the quality of seedlings planted and the availability of irrigation. In addition, no natural regenerated poplar stand has been found, and no natural regeneration of poplar plants has been observed around plantations. Taken together, it is apparent that transgenic poplar plantations will have little chance to spread transgenes into the natural forestry; this rationale prompted the National Forestry Administration in 2002 to grant permission for the commercialization of transgenic poplar clones in six provinces in China far from natural poplar stands. However, no empirical data have been collected to test and support this hypothesis.  In this study, we used the mature Bt poplar plantation at the Manas Plain Forest Station, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to access possible gene flow from a transgenic poplar plantation through pollen and seeds. We would like to address the following questions: (1) How far does Bt poplar pollen travel and successfully fertilize other poplar trees in the local climate? (2) In a population of mixed non-transgenic and transgenic male poplars, are the seeds with the Bt gene produced according to the ratio of the two types of males? (3) What is the probability of Bt poplar seeds germinating and establishing under different conditions? The answers to these questions would provide the basis for understanding the safety issues surrounding the application of transgenic trees.    Results   Identification of the Bt transgene by PCR amplification of Bt fragments from transgenic leaves, pollen and hybrid seeds  Seeds collected from non-transgenic CK3 ( P . nigra ) in the transgenic poplar plantation (TPP, Fig 1 ) and P . nigra cv. ‘Pioneer ’ trees (Figs 1 and 2A ) at four sites (No. 4, No. 10, No. 13 and NE01; Fig 1 ) were used for DNA extraction and amplification of Bt fragments using gene-specific primers. The high cross compatibility between ‘Pioneer’ and Bt poplars was revealed by pollinating female flowers ( Fig 2B ) with pollen from transgenic male flowers ( Fig 2C ) to produce fruits ( Fig 2D ) and seeds ( Fig 2E ). The PCR products of the Bt fragment amplified from the leaves of female ‘Pioneer’ trees, the leaves and pollen of the transgenic male tree and the leaves of their progenies are shown in Fig 3A . The successful amplification of the Bt fragment from transgenic clones and their progenies indicated that the Bt gene still existed in the genome of transgenic poplars and could be transferred to its offspring by crossing. The amplified products of seeds collected from the ‘Pioneer’ trees at the four sites were also used to measure the probability of the transgene flow, and examples from site No. 4 are provided in Fig 3B .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170201.g001  Fig 1   Sketched map of the sites of the transgenic poplar plantation (TPP) and the surrounding non-transgenic plantations.  There were 23 Bt flowering transgenic male poplar trees and 63 non-transgenic male trees (39 non-transgenic P . nigra clonal trees and 24 P . × euramericana cv. ‘Robusta’ clonal trees) in the TPP, while there were 72 P . nigra cv. ‘Russkii’ ( P . nigra cv. ‘Italica’× P . nigra ) clonal trees and six P . × euramericana cv. ‘Leipzeg’ clonal trees distributed in the southeast ‘Pioneer’ plantation. The trees in the ‘Pioneer’ plantation that were sampled for seed collection were located in both the southeast (No. 0, No. 4, No. 10 and No. 13) and northeast (NE01). The distance from the sampling trees to the TPP are shown in Table 1 .

Bt seeds produced with pollen from the Bt poplar plantation  The collected seeds, ranging from 3,045 to 6,190 for each female tree at the four sites (No. 4, No. 10, No. 13 and NE01; Fig 1 ) in two adjacent years, were used to amplify the Bt fragment ( Fig 3B ) and measure the frequency of Bt seeds that occurred in the collected seeds; the results are listed in Table 1 . Bt seeds occurred at rates of 0.16% and 0.15% (in the two years, respectively) at site No. 0 in the transgenic poplar plantation but only 0.05% and 0.07% at site No. 4 and 0.03% and 0.02% at site No. 10. Although more collected seeds were tested, no Bt gene was detected in the seeds at sites No. 13 and NE01. No. 13 was located 794 m southeast of the TPP, while NE01 was located 368 m northeast of the TPP. This result indicated that the number of detected Bt -containing seeds was related not only to the distance from the TPP but also the direction to the TPP.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170201.t001  Table 1  Summary of the proportion of seeds with Bt from sampled sites.

After three days of germination, five seedlings were pooled as one sample for DNA extraction. The data were collected from two continuous years (2006–2007).      Paternal assessment of the seeds collected from the sampled trees  To further analyze what potential pollen, other than Bt poplar pollen, contributed to the seeds collected from the plantation, 77, 115 and 116 seeds were collected from the sampled trees at sites No. 1, No. 4 and No. 10 for paternity analysis, respectively ( Fig 1 ). Seeds from the female trees at No. 1, No. 4, and No. 10 were dominantly pollinated by P . nigra cv. ‘Russkii ’ male trees at rates of 92.21%, 57.39%, and 71.05%, respectively. This might be explained by the fact that there were 72 ‘Russkii’ trees distributed in the entire poplar plantation, accounting for 51% of the total male trees. In addition, 4.35% and 7.89% of the seeds from No. 4 and No. 10 were produced by unknown poplar males. These two sites were more open to the outside of the plantation, which may have been pollinated by male poplar trees other than those in the plantation, while the female tree at site No. 1 was slightly inside the plantation and thus not easily able to receive outside pollen.    Germination ability and seedling survival of Bt poplar seeds under different conditions  The germination rates of seeds after storage at 4°C, at room temperature or under field conditions are summarized in Table 2 . After three weeks of storage, the germination rates of Bt seeds stored at room temperature and in the field decreased to 7% and 0%, respectively, while a 48% germination rate was obtained for the seeds stored at 4°C for four weeks. It was determined that poplar seeds remained viable for only two weeks under natural conditions [ 13 ]. Therefore, there was no significant change in the viability of Bt poplar seeds. The higher germination rate of seeds stored at room temperature compared with that stored under field conditions indicates that besides temperature, other factors, such as exposure to sun light and air moisture, may also affect the germination ability of seeds.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170201.t002  Table 2  The average germination rate of Bt poplar seeds after storage.

Bt poplar seeds were sown under field conditions with different treatments (see materials and methods ). In the two plots without any treatments, no seedlings survived. For the six plots that were cleaned/trimmed, watered or covered with plastic film at the two sites, the rate of seedling establishment varied from 0.3 to 11.3% after one week but decreased to 0.2 to 3.5% after two months ( Table 3 ). There was only a 0.3% germination rate of Bt poplar seeds at one plot due to water flow that formed by rain two days after the seeding.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170201.t003  Table 3  Seedling survival rate during eight weeks in the field after sowing.

Discussion  The concern about transgene escape via the pollen or seeds of transgenic trees regards a possible negative effect on the natural forest ecological system, and this concern has hurdled the application of transgenic trees [ 14 ]. Thus, it is important to understand the pollen dispersal, seed production and seedling survival of transgenic trees. Previous studies have used established stands and simulation models to explore the consequences of introducing new genes into the environment. In this study, we take advantage of the commercialized insect-resistance transgenic poplar [ 15 ] and for the first time have provided empirical data to evaluate the possibility of transgene flow through pollen or seeds.  In natural populations, the possibility of introgression is especially high in poplars because reproductive barriers between species are weak. Meirmans et al. studied the rate of spontaneous hybridization from two poplar plantations into an adjacent natural population of P . deltoides and P . balsamifera . The significantly high rate of hybridization in the natural population suggests that small peripheral populations carry a higher risk of introgression [ 16 ]. Generally, biases in relative abundance can influence the direction of gene flow. Relative abundance may contribute to the asymmetric introgression of P . nigra genes, as this exotic species is much less abundant and is expected to contribute less to the pollen cloud than the native P . balsamifera in North America [ 17 , 18 ]. These results indicate that the access of gene flow is very important and influenced by many factors that may lead to different genetic consequences in different populations. Therefore, the transgene flow of transgenic trees under field conditions needs to be studied.  Without commercialized transgenic tree plantations, it is not practical to assess transgene escape to conventional populations. The alternative would be to develop and exploit simulation models, such as STEVE and AMELIE, to gain insight into the gene flow in forest trees. Several models of pollen and seed dispersal have been proposed for forest trees [ 19 – 22 ]. For example, Kuparinen and Schurr investigated the rate of transgene escape in cases where the modified organism carried mitigation genes [ 21 ], and DiFazio used his model to predict transgene escape assuming long-distance dispersal as a common phenomenon [ 19 ]. Many results indicate that long-distance dispersal is extensive and that pollen dispersal curves are similar in populations with very different ecological and demographic characteristics [ 6 ]. Indeed, Roe et al. compared and contrasted exotic hybridization and introgression to the same processes occurring among native poplars in eastern Canada. In this native hybrid poplar zone, gene flow was asymmetric, with exotic alleles predominantly introgressing into P . balsamifera and hybrid formation among natives occurring primarily with the female P . deltoides . They also found that the majority of gene flow (more than 98%) was intraspecific [ 23 , 24 ]. DiFazio et al. reported that the mean pollination distance for P . trichocarpa ranged from 140 to 1,100 m, with a strong dependence on the area sampled [ 20 ]. Pospísková & Sálková found that the effective pollination distance was 10 to 230 m within a P . nigra population along the Morava River [ 25 ]. The study of Rathmacher et al. showed that only a minor portion of gene flow occurred at distance beyond 1,000 m, and poplar seeds generally had shorter dispersal distances with a maximum distance of 500 m [ 26 ]. Bialozyt reported that most effective pollinations (75%) occurred within a distance of less than 1,000 m between native black poplar trees ( P . nigra ) and its commercial hybrid ( P . × canadensis ), and only a very limited proportion of effective pollinations occurred at distances greater than 2,000 m in central Germany [ 27 ]. Therefore, there was a wide range in the distance of pollen dispersal observed in poplar plantations based on these population studies and models. In our study, the results indicated that the pollen dispersal of Bt poplars occurred within 500 m in distance, which is close to the minimum limit of that predicted by the models or population analysis. The dispersal of Bt pollen was also affected by the wind direction during the flowering period in the spring. Due to the prevailing wind direction from the northwest to southeast in the study site, it is reasonable that no Bt pollen-pollinated seeds were detected in the northeast site (NE01), though the separation of an approximately 200 m-wide poplar plantation between the TPP and the site NE01 may have also limited Bt pollen dispersal.  The formation of a hybrid plant does not mean that a wild population will be established [ 28 ]. Hypocotyls develop within 6–8 h after moisture has reached the seed and the pappus has degraded [ 29 ], and the seedling cannot survive if conditions are not favorable for further development. Germination occurs exclusively on bare soil [ 30 ]. The results of this study revealed that transgenic poplar seeds lost germination ability under field conditions after three weeks but retained an almost unaffected germination ability at 4°C during long storage. Therefore, there is a crucial period of three weeks for the germination of transgenic seeds in the field. When sown at test sites without watering, no transgenic poplar seeds were germinated in the bare field, but a 3.5% seedling survival rate was obtained with watering, weeding and tillage. According to the study by Guilloy-Froget et al., successful germination of P . nigra seeds depends on a change to hydrated conditions [ 31 ]. Therefore, various factors, including soil, water, and weeds, will affect the germination and survival of seeds, and water seems to be the most important limiting factor. The significance of seed dispersal is highly dependent on plantation size [ 32 ]. In this study, the number of male transgenic poplar trees (23) was small, which might affect the fertilization of their pollen under competition with non-transgenic pollen from 141 males. As a result, only 0.16% and 0.15% Bt seeds from the control (No. CK3) were detected in the transgenic poplar plantation during the two years, respectively. The paternity analysis also supported this suggestion that the non-transgenic male trees dominated the pollen pool and would produce more non- Bt seeds; thus, transgenic seeds could not be readily produced under such conditions.  In summary, our study provides evidence that the pollen from transgenic trees travels a limited distance, and under the presence of a large number of non-transgenic males, the probability of Bt pollen successfully producing Bt progeny is quite rare. In addition, the transgenic seeds could not easily germinate and the seedlings could not easily survive in the dry areas of northern China. Therefore, it can be concluded that transgenes may not easily flow to the local poplar forestry based on this empirical data.    Materials and Methods   Plant materials and seed collection  The experimental site is located at Manas Plain Forest Station (N44°15 ' 56 " , E86°19 ' 60 " ), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The transgenic P . nigra plantation (TPP) was planted with two-year cuttings on approximately 0.68 ha of agricultural land ( Fig 1 ) in 1994. The adjacent poplar plantations included a P . alba plantation in the north (0.74 ha), a P . × canadensis (a female clone) plantation in the east (2.3 ha) and a P . nigra cv. ‘Pioneer’ ( P . nigra cv. ‘Italica’ × P . nigra , female) plantation in the southeast (11.3 ha) and northeast (1.2 ha). The field south of the transgenic poplar plantation was used for agriculture. There were 23 Bt flowering transgenic male poplar trees and 63 non-transgenic male trees (39 and 24 clonal trees of non-transgenic P . nigra and P . × euramericana cv. ‘Robusta’, respectively, in the TPP), while 72 and 6 clonal trees of P . nigra cv. ‘Russkii’ ( P . nigra cv. ‘Italica’× P . nigra ) and P . × euramericana cv. ‘Leipzeg’, respectively, were distributed in southeast ‘Pioneer’ plantation. No other male trees were planted at the experimental site. The details of each plantation are shown in S1 Table .  High crossability between transgenic P . nigra and P . nigra cv. ‘Pioneer ’ was observed in our pilot experiment ( Fig 2 ), and the flowering time of these two clones was also compatible in the experimental site. The sampling trees in the ‘Pioneer’ plantation for seed collection were located in both the southeast (No. 1, No. 4, No. 10 and No. 13) and northeast (NE01). One female P . nigra tree control (CK3) in the TPP was also sampled. The plantation of P . × canadensis (female) was established in the same year (1994) as was the TPP. The sampling sites were chosen in the southeast plantation because the wind direction favored pollen dispersal in this direction in northern China. The period of pollination of the male trees was 5–6 days starting from April 8 at a temperature ranging from -5 to 23°C, with prevailing winds (0.2~10.7 m/s wind speed) from the northwest.  Seeds were collected from single trees at the above sites when dehiscing capsules began grouping in catkins in the spring of 2006 and 2007. Seeds were dried at room temperature, and the wool was removed by hand. Next, the seeds were put into envelopes in sealed plastic bags filled with silicon and stored in the cold. Germination rates were tested in triplicate with 100 seeds per replicate after cold storage for one, two, three, and four weeks. The seeds were sown on wet filter paper in Petri dishes, and the germination rates were determined on the fourth day after sowing. A seed was considered to have germinated with the appearance of two healthy cotyledons. To evaluate the germination of seeds and the survival of the seedlings in natural fields, we sowed 1,000 seeds in 16 plots with or without cleaning/trimming, weeding, watering or plastic film covering at two sites with 8 plots per treatment.    Detection of Bt fragments by PCR  To detect Bt seeds, the collected seeds were sown on wet filter paper in a Petri dish and germinated at room temperature. After three days of germination, five seedlings were pooled as one sample for DNA extraction to reduce lab work (an extremely low Bt detection rate was observed in our pre-experiments) using the CTAB method. DNA concentration was estimated by comparing the brightness of the band with that of standard markers. Approximately 50 ng of DNA was used to amplify the Bt DNA fragment using gene-specific primers (5′-GAA TTC GCT AGG AAC CAA GCC ATT-3′ and 5′-AAG TAT ATC CAT CAA ATG TGG ACT-3′), and PCR was performed as previously described [ 33 ]. After 5 min at 94°C, the PCR reaction was carried out for 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min. After a final incubation at 72°C for 5 min, 5 μl of the PCR products was analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized under UV light after staining with EtBr solution. Bt seeds were used as control to check the fidelity of the PCR amplification.    Paternity analysis  Four candidate paternal poplar clones ( P . nigra , P . × euramericana cv. ‘Robusta’, P . nigra cv. ‘Russkii ’ , and P . × euramericana cv. ‘Leipzeg’) were identified in the plantations ( Fig 1 ). Based on our previous study, the four paternal poplar could be effectively identified by four SSR loci (wpms04, wpms14, wpms18, and wpms20) ( S1 Fig ). To test the paternal source of seeds of the open-pollinated P . nigra cv. ‘Pioneer’, 308 seeds (from trees No. 1, No. 4, and No. 10) were analyzed using the four SSR loci. Primer sequences and PCR profiles were the same as described by van der Schoot et al. [ 34 ] and Smulders et al. [ 35 ]. Fragment analyses were performed on the QIAxcel System (QIAGEN, Germany). The Biocalculator software program was used to present the results as both simulated bands in gel images and peaks in electropherograms. The potential paternal parent of each seed was conferred by the appearance of the SSR patterns for each locus. The primers used in this study were shown in S2 Table .

Background  Primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in older people is challenging as they are a diverse group with varying needs, frequent presence of comorbidities, and are more susceptible to treatment harms. Moreover the potential benefits and harms of preventive medication for older people are uncertain. We explored GPs’ decision making about primary CVD prevention in patients aged 75 years and older.    Method  25 GPs participated in semi-structured interviews in New South Wales, Australia. Transcribed audio-recordings were thematically coded and Framework Analysis was used.    Results  Analysis identified factors that are likely to contribute to variation in the management of CVD risk in older people. Some GPs based CVD prevention on guidelines regardless of patient age. Others tailored management based on factors such as perceptions of prevention in older age, knowledge of limited evidence, comorbidities, polypharmacy, frailty, and life expectancy. GPs were more confident about: 1) medication and lifestyle change for fit/healthy older patients, and 2) stopping or avoiding medication for frail/nursing home patients. Decision making for older patients outside of these categories was less clear.    Conclusion  Older patients receive different care depending on their GP’s perceptions of ageing and CVD prevention, and their knowledge of available evidence. GPs consider CVD prevention for older patients challenging and would welcome more guidance in this area.        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925  National Health and Medical Research Council    633003      http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925  National Health and Medical Research Council    511217   The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), through grants awarded to the Screening and Test Evaluation Program (no. 633003) and Bond University (no. 511217).

Scientific evidence for treatments and tests in the older population is often limited as this group has traditionally been excluded from clinical trials, and when included they are generally more fit and healthy than older people in the community [ 1 ]. Multimorbidity often leads to polypharmacy, which increases the risk of drug-related problems (e.g. adverse drug reactions) [ 2 ]. As a result, it is difficult to predict the effect of each individual drug and to compare the overall benefits and harms [ 3 , 4 ]. In addition, the older population is heterogeneous. Older people vary widely in their health and function, and in their treatment and health outcome preferences [ 5 – 7 ]. General practitioners (GPs) are at the frontline of providing care for older people, and not surprisingly studies have identified numerous challenges [ 8 , 9 ].  One issue that stands out as particularly complex is decision making about preventive medications in older people [ 8 – 10 ]. This requires weighing up the potential of future benefits, which is difficult to quantify for an individual, against short term risk of harm due to adverse effects of medications in the context of decreasing life expectancy and overall health. In a qualitative study, GPs expressed feeling “under pressure” from clinical guidelines to prescribe preventive medicines despite acknowledging that potential harms of side effects of preventive medication and polypharmacy may outweigh future risk reduction [ 11 ].  Medicines for primary CVD prevention are commonly used in older people [ 12 – 14 ] and these medicines are frequently continued until the end of life when they may not be necessary [ 14 , 15 ]. Most international guidelines for primary CVD prevention encourage the use of 5- or 10 year absolute (or overall, global or combined) CVD risk scores (AR) to target preventive treatment in asymptomatic patients who are at high risk [ 16 ]. However, CVD risk prediction models are not well validated in older people [ 17 ]. Since AR increases with age, and people at higher risk benefit more in terms of risk reduction, it is reasonable to argue that older people (and especially otherwise healthy older people) have the potential to benefit at least as much from primary CVD prevention as younger people [ 18 , 19 ], and otherwise healthy older people should not be denied potentially effective preventive medication based on their age alone. However, many commonly used cardiovascular risk prediction models do not allow for competing risks from non-cardiovascular deaths. This may lead to over-estimation of short term cardiovascular risk and the potential benefit from preventive treatment in older people, especially those with a very limited life expectancy. The benefits and harms of cardiovascular disease preventive medication for older people are therefore uncertain [ 20 , 21 ].  Several principles have been proposed that are potentially helpful in supporting clinician decision making in this arena [ 22 – 24 ]. Key in all of these approaches is optimising care by carefully tailoring treatment to the context and preferences of the individual (older) patient with multimorbidity. However, systematic reviews suggest that these principles are generally poorly applied in guidelines for this group [ 25 – 28 ]. One review looked at primary CVD prevention in older people specifically, and showed that only a handful of clinical practice guidelines adequately addressed evidence about potential benefits and harms of CVD prevention in older people or how to tailor CVD management to multimorbidity and limited life expectancy [ 25 ]. If guidance on primary CVD prevention for older people is so limited, how do GPs navigate this complex topic?  This study investigated GPs’ experiences of primary CVD prevention amongst older patients (aged 75+) to identify how they make decisions about the management of CVD risk in this population.    Methods   Participants  Twenty-five GPs participated in New South Wales, Australia. Participants were purposively selected to cover a range of characteristics that are known to influence CVD risk management and/or may influence management of older people [ 29 – 32 ]. This included gender, age, years of GP practice, number of patients in practice aged 75 years and older, and use of absolute CVD risk AR assessment. See Table 1 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170228.t001  Table 1  GP characteristics.            Characteristic  Category  n      Sex  Female  13    Male  12    Age (years)  <40  5    40–49  1    50–59  10    60+  9    Years of practice  <10  2    10–19  4    20–29  7    30+  12    GP role in practice  Contractor/sessional/retainer/salaried  12    Partner/principal  13    Number of GPs in practice  1–5  15    6–10  6    11+  4         Recruitment  GPs were sent invitation letters through eight Divisions of General Practice. Fifty-seven GPs returned expression of interest forms, of which 25 GPs were enrolled into this study, the remaining GPs were interviewed as part of a study on CVD risk management in the general population (<75 years of age) [ 33 , 34 ]. Analyses suggested saturation of key themes, so no further recruitment was conducted [ 35 ]. Ethics approval for the study was obtained through the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Sydney Local Health District (Protocol No. X11-0200).    Data collection  Semi-structured interview schedules covering CVD risk assessment and management were developed by the research team, piloted with a convenience sample of GPs, and revised to improve question clarity (see S1 Text ). Participants signed a consent form before being interviewed in person or by telephone. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim. Two authors trained in public health qualitative methods (JJ, SM) conducted interviews between November 2011 and September 2012.    Analysis  A Framework Analysis method was used. This is a matrix-based method of thematic analysis involving five steps: 1) familiarisation with the data through reading/coding/discussing initial transcripts (JJ, SM, CB); 2) creating a thematic framework (JJ, SM, CB); 3) indexing—coding remaining transcripts according to the framework, with iterative revision of framework (JJ, SM); 4) charting—themes/quotes summarised in the framework (JJ, SM); 5) mapping and interpretation—framework data were examined within and across themes and participants, summarised (SM), and discussed with all authors [ 36 ]. Rigour was addressed by: repeated coding of transcripts by different team members; constant comparison between the existing framework and new data; detailed documentation of the analysis process; and discussion of themes with all authors, including an experienced qualitative researcher (KM), two academic GPs (JD, PG), and a geriatrician (VN) [ 37 ].     Results  Most GPs felt uncertain about CVD risk management in older people, however they varied in: 1) their awareness of (the lack of) evidence for primary CVD prevention in older people, 2) their perceptions of treatment complexity and feasibility in the older patient context, and 3) their ability and confidence to adapt management accordingly. In the following section, we will explain overall patterns relating to GPs decision making about primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in older adults. Table 2 provides a summary of these themes, with illustrative quotes from the data. For evidence relating to GPs’ decision making approaches, please see S1 Table .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170228.t002  Table 2  Summary of themes relating to GPs’ decision making about primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in older adults * .           Theme  Illustrative quote      Applicability of primary CVD prevention guidelines for older people    Same guidelines for all ages   "The guidelines for managing cardiovascular risk are all the same regardless of age" (GP47).  “If it’s [the AR calculator] actually validated and is actually in here for most of us to use, it actually should be appropriate to use for anyone.” (GP30)    No valid guidelines for older adults   "Well the [CVD risk] calculators don't tend to go over, much over 75, so they don't help very much" (GP51)  “I’d follow the guidelines up until the age of 70, that sounds appropriate but I am less confident if they are age 75” (GP20).    Different guidelines for older adults   “Recently there's a suggestion we can accept higher blood pressure, round about 150, in the elderly and perhaps higher cholesterol" (GP27)    The older patient context    Fit versus frail older adults   "Even if they're not very elderly but very frail or have malignant illnesses I would be much less aggressive in the treatment of cardiovascular risk…otherwise I would treat it aggressively, the same if they were 65 or even 55." (GP43)  “They got classified as 'old' and you'd have to say well this lady who is acutely ill now actually lives at home and looks after herself… and leads an active life.." (GP23)    Quality of life as treatment goal   "We just try to put more emphasis on how they're feeling and how they function, if they can walk, if they don't feel dizzy, it's the whole thing." (GP30)  “If they do get their weight down, if they do start to exercise a bit more than they were or walk or whatever, they are going to be improving their longevity, their fitness to be older; they’re going to have a better quality of life. We may not make their life longer but we might make it have more quality.” (GP12)    Multimorbidity   "So I approach differently people over 75 who have significant co-morbidities. I’m very enthusiastic for them to stop worrying about issues such as blood pressure and cholesterol." (GP 53).    Prognosis and life expectancy   “And at the age of 86, you know, you wonder, if you do treat these, is it really going to make any difference? You know, people are, are maybe going to live until they’re, they’re 90 or something like that. So over the next four years, will it make any difference? And, you know, realistically, probably it won’t make much difference." (GP49)  “I think we do need to manage their risk factors. It doesn’t matter if they’re old or not (…) people are living longer and they are very healthy” (GP50)    Balancing benefits and harms   "The main challenge is to, are you doing more harm or good by treating them. Are you going to cause them more issues by treating them, for example are you going to drop their blood pressure and they fall over and break their hip and they die in 6 months. Or are you better off leaving them alone and keeping your fingers crossed that they don't have a heart attack in 12 months, 2 years. It's very difficult." (GP51)  “You can’t do much about their age now can you and, again you run the risk of overtreating them. And perhaps one of these things is whatever you do don’t do any harm (…) if you’ve got the healthy elderly who have maybe minor risk factors (…) rather than giving them drugs I think you’ve probably got to think about not harming them.” (GP23)    Treatment complexity and optimising care    Perceived modifiability of CVD risk in older people   “People who have reached that other side of 75 you know they've got genes for longevity. I have got to assume this person will reach 95 and they're 75." (GP12)  “I might go a little bit… strongly on the risk factors because they haven’t got much time to… on their hands to improve their cardiovascular risk factors. I might start them on medication sooner rather than later.” (GP39)    Less stringent treatment thresholds and targets   "I think you have to loosen up the targets quite frankly because I can get them to target but that then becomes a compliance thing because they just hate, they just, they just feel miserable" (GP51)    Polypharmacy   "[In] older people we have to be very, very careful of the dosage. It all depends upon their clinical state of health then. And we have to be very, very careful of the interaction of the medication and their cognition and understanding of the medication intake." (GP15)    Deprescribing   "I do a lot of work in palliative care. And I also have a lot of patients in retirement village and nursing homes and so on. And I encourage them, all those people, to stop the medications that are associated with prolonging life, such as statins and aspirin and, and so on. I think if people have got cognitive impairment and therefore have to be in an aged care facility, we shouldn’t be trying to avoid heart attacks. " (GP53)  “I’m keen to try and reduce medication where I can if possible and would look at ways of trying to streamline it… minimise side effects of the different medications they may be on” (GP20).       *See S1 Table for evidence related to GPs’ decision making approach     Applicability of primary CVD prevention guidelines for older people  Contradictory stances emerged regarding how GPs viewed the applicability of primary CVD prevention guidelines. Some GPs seemed to assume that guidelines are applicable to patients of all ages and because the use of absolute CVD risk (AR) is recommended in the Australian guidelines, and is available as a tool in practice software, presume it must have been validated for all ages. Other GPs were aware of limitations with the guidelines, for example, that Framingham based AR models cut off at age 74 and may therefore not be valid for patients aged 75+. Some GPs mentioned recent studies and/or guideline recommendations that specify adjusted treatment targets for older people, and other GPs stated that they were unsure about guideline recommendations for this population.  This variation was also reflected in management approaches. Several GPs described their approach to CVD risk management as largely the same in older versus younger patients, driven by the perceived high importance of reducing CVD risk (factors). Other GPs mentioned that their approach is generally “less intense” (GP55) in older people and/or described factors that they take into account in their decision making, in particular frailty, quality of life, balancing benefits and harms, multimorbidity, and prognosis or life expectancy. We will discuss each of these factors in more detail below.    The older patient context   Fit versus frail older adults  Level of frailty played a more important role than age in determining how GPs manage CVD risk. GPs tended to take a similar approach to CVD risk management in patients regardless of age if the patient is fit and healthy. Frail patients, including patients in nursing homes, were less aggressively managed generally. Several GPs commented that CVD risk is less modifiable in frailer patients, due to inability to exercise or unfeasible treatment targets (see ‘Less stringent treatment thresholds and targets’ below). Although according to some, lifestyle change is still possible. Some GPs mentioned that it is important not to misclassify patients as frail or fit, as it cannot be presumed that these states are stable over time.    Quality of life  Several GPs expressed that their main goal of care is to improve/maintain older patients’ quality of life, mobility, independence and activities of daily living, and according to that perspective, managing CVD risk is an added bonus for some but a necessity for others. Some, but not all, GPs therefore expressed a preference for “prescribing” lifestyle change, in particular exercise, over medication as it has broader benefits for general quality of life including improved mobility, cognitive function, and falls risk management.  Similarly, patients may be encouraged to take medication if it is felt that medication may improve their quality of life (e.g. a CVD preventive medication might be more likely to be prescribed if it also helped alleviate a patient’s shortness of breath).    Multimorbidity  Several GPs commented that they are less concerned about high blood pressure and cholesterol in older patients with multimorbidity and they may decide not to manage CVD risk in these patients, as lifestyle change and medication may reduce already poor quality of life (e.g. due to polypharmacy and increased risk of drug related problems, or stopping enjoyable habits for limited health benefit).    Prognosis and life expectancy  Contrasting ideas about life expectancy can justify both decisions to manage and to not manage CVD risk. According to some GPs, as life expectancy is difficult to predict for an individual older patient, there is still scope for preventive management to make a difference. Older patients’ shorter life expectancy prompted some GPs to prescribe medication to try and achieve an effect as soon as possible.  Several GPs questioned the usefulness of preventive medication (in particular statins) for older patients if they are unlikely to live long enough to benefit from it. Estimated life expectancy was also weighed against the patient’s risk level with patients perceived to be at higher risk (e.g. very high blood pressure or high AR) more likely to be treated regardless of their prognosis. Some took CVD risk management as an opportunity to talk about end of life planning and advanced care plans, although others commented that their patients are not inclined to discuss these issues with their GP.    Balancing benefits and harms  GPs talked about the challenge of finding the appropriate balance between risk reduction, reduced quality of life (particularly due to side effects), and the burden of taking medication in the context of limited life expectancy. The point was raised by some GPs that certain patients might prefer a shorter life and a faster death due to a heart attack over living longer and dying slowly in a nursing home setting. At the same time, GPs mentioned the need to prevent stroke and especially stroke related disability in older people, resulting in a dilemma around the benefits and harms of preventive medication.  Falls risk was a commonly mentioned side effect that GPs want to avoid which influenced the decision to prescribe anti-hypertensive medication, and subsequent treatment dosage. Other side effects of medication mentioned included body pain with statins, and liver dysfunction.     Treatment complexity and optimising care   Perceived modifiability of CVD risk in older people  Age was mentioned as one of the main CVD risk factors, thereby generally reducing the modifiability of CVD risk in older people: "because as I said age itself is… harder to control" (GP39). Often, a distinction was made between the ‘young-old’ (aged 75–85 years) and the ‘old-old’ (85 years plus) and several GPs commented that they would not start preventive treatment in the latter group.  At the same time, risk modifiability was considered to be influenced by patient context (e.g. general health, multimorbidity–see ‘The older patient context’ above) and patient motivation rather than age. The concept of some older adults being “genetically young” and showing a “degree of survivorship” was mentioned. This could either motivate GPs to actively manage risk or result in the perception that if CVD isn’t established at age 75, active risk management is not required.  Many GPs thought that risk was less modifiable with lifestyle change than medication.  However several also spoke of non-CVD risk related benefits to lifestyle change, and patients reducing their CVD risk through lifestyle changes even at an older age. Perceived modifiability also depended on older patients’ motivation to take medications or make lifestyle changes. Many GPs talked about older patients being change averse, specifically in regards to smoking cessation, diet, and exercise.    Less stringent treatment thresholds and targets  Although some mentioned using the same approach in older versus younger patients, many GPs commented that treatment targets and prescribing thresholds are not feasible for older people and need to be applied more flexibly due to increased risk of side effects, frequent polypharmacy, and the complexities of multimorbidity in this group. This flexibility was mentioned generally and specifically in regards to cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes control.    Polypharmacy  GPs mentioned age related differences in how the body responds to medication, and the increased risk of interactions between medication and various factors including other medication, cognition, and alcohol. One GP expressed a hesitation to introduce new medications, as it can be difficult to distinguish side effects of medication from multimorbidity or other health issues. Some GPs raised concerns about overtreating older patients who are at high risk due to their age but have otherwise minor risk factors.    Deprescribing  Some GPs also mentioned a desire to minimise medication burden by stopping, or not initiating medication, especially in the very elderly or those in a nursing home, or if the patient is already taking multiple medicines. Not starting, or stopping, was more often mentioned for cholesterol than blood pressure lowering medication. GPs were more likely to recommend stopping medication if they thought it would improve quality of life. Some GPs mentioned using absolute risk (e.g. showing a patient that high risk is mainly caused by older age) as an argument for avoiding unnecessary CVD medication and reducing polypharmacy.    Shared decision making issues  Patient preferences were mentioned often, in relation to decision making involvement and making a trade-off between potential benefits and harms. Some GPs perceived a preference for paternalism and the GP making the decision in some of their older patients. On the other hand, some GPs commented that patient preferences for involvement are personality not age-based. Personal, cultural, and family attitudes towards longevity and death were also raised as important factors when making decisions about preventive medication. Several GPs talked about the challenge of keeping patients on potentially unnecessary medication at the urging of family members or because it has been prescribed by specialists who are perceived to be more strict in their CVD risk management approach.  Although most GPs adapted their care for older people to some extent, some GPs seemed to be particularly good at tailoring to the older patient context. These GPs were more aware of the evidence around CVD risk assessment and management in older adults, were concerned about polypharmacy and balancing the harms and benefits of taking preventive medications, expressed the opinion that lifestyle change is achievable for older adults, tailored their lifestyle advice according to patients’ capabilities and preferences, and were keen to engage older adults and carers in decision making regarding interventions. However, it is important to note that often these GPs did not show all of these characteristics and, almost without exception, GPs expressed uncertainty around (some aspects of) CVD risk management in older people. Table 3 provides a summary of the shared decision making issues reported by GPs, with illustrative quotes from the data.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170228.t003  Table 3  Shared decision making issues related to GPs’ decision making about primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in older adults.

(GP12)    Conflict with family  “It is interesting, however, the number of relatives that object to mum with metastatic breast cancer being, having her Lipitor stopped.” (GP53)    Experience of harms  "I do listen to patient priorities and preferences. If the cholesterol medication makes them feel miserable and icky (…) then it's really not worth them going through that in terms of quality of life for a few percentage points on a risk tool." (GP42)           Discussion  This study identified factors that are likely to contribute to variation in how GPs manage CVD risk in older people (defined as ≥75 years). This includes: differences in GP knowledge of available evidence for CVD prevention, applicability of the guidelines for older people, attitudes towards ageing, awareness of older patient context, and perceived importance of CVD prevention and risk reduction in the older population. Some GPs suggested treating older patients the same as younger patients, assuming the guidelines apply equally to patients of all ages; other GPs considered older people’s management required careful adjustment according to their specific context and circumstances. These latter GPs often mentioned the importance of reducing the burden of treatment and prioritising care (often with prevention perceived as less important than symptom management and improving/maintaining quality of life). It is not surprising that there is substantial variation in GP practice. Two recent reviews independently showed that clinical practice guidelines are highly disease specific and tend to ignore patient context [ 28 ], often recommending the initiation of preventive medication therapy without consideration of multimorbidity, advanced illness, or limited life expectancy [ 25 ].  When discussing CVD risk management approaches, GPs often distinguished between fit versus frail older patients. Many GPs treated healthy and fit older people the same as younger patients but were more cautious in their approach with frail older people and would consider not starting, or stopping, preventive medication in this group. GPs appeared to differ in their definitions of frailty although many referred to the following factors: multimorbidity, taking multiple medicines, dependence/living in nursing home, life limiting illness (for example cancer), and dementia [ 38 ]. Fit older patients were often defined as the ‘genetically young,’ on few medications, independent, and with an active lifestyle. Current clinical evidence seems to concur with this approach; increasingly studies show that although treatment with statins and/or hypertension medication might be beneficial in older patients who are healthy and functionally independent, there is uncertainty about the benefits and increased risk of harm in frail older patients (including those with multimorbidity and/or a limited life expectancy) [ 2 , 39 , 40 ].  The potential benefits and harms of preventive treatment for older people at high risk of a first primary CVD event also apply to those with prior history of CVD; and the probability of either of these classifications increases with age (along with prevalence of undiagnosed ‘silent’ events [ 41 ] which carry a similar prognosis to clinical events–these are especially likely where there is a history of clinical CVD or a person is at high risk of a first primary event [ 42 ]). A qualitative focus group study of secondary CVD prevention in older people found similar dilemmas and uncertainties about the potential benefits and harms of secondary cardiovascular prevention, with management often based on frailty rather than chronological age [ 43 ].  When discussing CVD risk management in older people, GPs almost exclusively talked about patients at either end of the spectrum (fit/robust versus frail), whereas in practice they will see many people who are likely to fit somewhere in the middle. A systematic review of 21 studies in 61,500 older people in the community estimated the prevalence rate of frailty as 9·9% (95% CI 9·6–10·2), and increasing with age (up to 26% in those 85 years or older) [ 44 ]. Similarly, more than 60% of people 65 and over have two or more comorbidities, and the number of comorbidities increases rapidly with age [ 45 ]. This may indirectly imply uncertainty about the best course of action for the group of patients who could not easily be identified as fit or frail. Dalton et al. [ 9 ] reported that clinicians generally find it straightforward to provide recommendations about colorectal cancer screening for older patients who are in good health (screening recommendation) or poor health (recommendation not to screen) but were uncertain about their recommendations for patients with moderate morbidities. Clinicians considered it more challenging to estimate life expectancy and weigh the potential benefits and downsides of screening for this group. This suggests that the issues are relevant to the management of older patients more broadly.  Our results suggest that some GPs make a subjective assessment of frailty on their older patients and this in turn influences the approach they take on primary CVD prevention. More formal measures of frailty [ 46 , 47 ] have been shown to be predictive of mortality, but it remains to be seen whether more formal objective assessments of frailty could be used to guide decisions about primary CVD prevention.  Due to the close balance between benefits and harms, shared decision making has been promoted in primary CVD prevention for older people [ 25 , 40 ]. However, in line with previous work [ 48 ], our interviews suggest that few GPs use a shared decision making approach and many refer to challenges associated with older patient involvement, including: third party involvement, a perception that older patients prefer a paternalistic relationship with their GP, and cognitive impairment. This is somewhat in contrast with a focus group study on secondary CVD prevention in which the majority of GPs mentioned using shared decision making as a way to deal with uncertainties around the management of older people [ 43 ]. The majority of the GPs in this study were highly skilled GPs (e.g. GPs with an interest in geriatrics and academic GPs), which may explain part of this difference.  The strengths of this study include a heterogeneous sample with a wide range of characteristics. Since GPs with strong opinions may have been more likely to agree to participate, some selection bias is possible. However, diverse opinions and approaches were reported, and on recruitment participating GPs were not aware that the interviews focused on CVD risk management in older patients specifically, suggesting that strong selection bias is unlikely. The sampling strategy aimed to maximise the range of experiences and views rather than be representative of the general GP population. Future research could investigate differences between GP and patient perceptions by comparing GP-patient dyads.    Conclusions  Depending on their perceptions of ageing and CVD prevention, and their knowledge of available evidence, GPs vary in how they make decisions about primary CVD prevention in older people. More support for SDM with older patients in GP practice (e.g. training, decision aids) is needed. In addition, guidelines should adopt an approach that is more suited to the increasing population of older people with multimorbidity. These guidelines should provide guidance on the challenges faced by GPs, including limited available evidence, and balancing the harms and benefits of CVD prevention in older people of varying life expectancy and levels of frailty.

A web geographical information system is a typical service-intensive application. Tile prefetching and cache replacement can improve cache hit ratios by proactively fetching tiles from storage and replacing the appropriate tiles from the high-speed cache buffer without waiting for a client’s requests, which reduces disk latency and improves system access performance. Most popular prefetching strategies consider only the relative tile popularities to predict which tile should be prefetched or consider only a single individual user's access behavior to determine which neighbor tiles need to be prefetched. Some studies show that comprehensively considering all users’ access behaviors and all tiles’ relationships in the prediction process can achieve more significant improvements. Thus, this work proposes a new global user-driven model for tile prefetching and cache replacement. First, based on all users’ access behaviors, a type of expression method for tile correlation is designed and implemented. Then, a conditional prefetching probability can be computed based on the proposed correlation expression mode. Thus, some tiles to be prefetched can be found by computing and comparing the conditional prefetching probability from the uncached tiles set and, similarly, some replacement tiles can be found in the cache buffer according to multi-step prefetching. Finally, some experiments are provided comparing the proposed model with other global user-driven models, other single user-driven models, and other client-side prefetching strategies. The results show that the proposed model can achieve a prefetching hit rate in approximately 10.6% ~ 110.5% higher than the compared methods.      the National Natural Science Foundation of China   41671382 and 41271398   Shaoming Pan       the National Natural Science Foundation of China   61572372   Yanwen Chong       the National Natural Science Foundation of China   51277167   Xicheng Tan       LIESMARS Special Research Funding    Shaoming Pan       the Fund of SAST   SAST201425   Yanwen Chong       CAST Innovation Fund    Xicheng Tan     This work has been partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41671382, 41271398, 61572372 and 51277167) and LIESMARS Special Research Funding, and also partially supported by the Fund of SAST (No. SAST201425) and Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation Fund (SAST2016006) and partially supported by Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining & Information Sharing of Ministry of Education,Fuzhou University(No.2016LSDMIS06).

Thus, many methods have been proposed to improve system performance on-the-fly, including PGSW-OS [ 1 ], MR-D [ 2 ], 2D-WDM [ 3 ], and LLLA [ 4 ], among others. Among these methods, PGSW-OS uses P2P (peer-to-peer) nodes to share resources to reduce the total resource consumption of the system. MR-D also uses a type of device-to-device (D2D) network to share the cellular spectrum. 2D-WDM is designed to improve network transmission efficiency by considering not only the time but also the wavelength in a wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) system. LLLA provides a new method to improve the efficiency of channel assignment in wireless mesh networks(WMNs). Obviously, all these methods can be profitably applied to a system to reduce resource consumption and improve response speed. However, compared to improving the transmission efficiency of the system by optimizing network topology, improving channel efficiency or capacity and preparing data for servers (or users) in advance can also be employed to reduce the response delay due to slow disk I/O speeds.  In fact, prefetching and caching is one pair of fundamental techniques for improving the quality of service and reducing the response time for users in web GIS. In this model, the data are split into smaller chunks called tiles [ 5 ] based on the pyramid model. A web GIS is a typical service-intensive application [ 6 ] that handles large numbers of user requests at the same time. The main purpose of a prefetching and caching model in GIS is to prefetch "hotspot" tiles from normal storage and put them into a high-speed cache pool, thus, reducing the request-response time and, ultimately, improving the system's performance. Because a server has a limited amount of high-speed cache space as well as a large number of tiles that need to be cached based on the large number of user requests, determining which tiles to prefetch and cache is difficult. Consequently, numerous related studies have been performed to address these key problems.  Some traditional classic algorithms such as FIFO (first in first out) and LRU (least recently used) are widely used by Google [ 7 ], NASA [ 8 ] and networked geographic information systems (NGISs) [ 9 ], and all these have achieved some good results. However, there are two main problems with these types of traditional algorithms: 1) FIFO and LRU consider only cache replacement policies; they do not address the problem how best to proactively prefetch tiles from storage to prepare data for users in advance; and 2) they use only the information inherent to the data itself to determine whether a certain tile should be replaced; they do not consider the fact that some very hot tiles will be accessed repeatedly and some related tiles exist that will be accessed simultaneously. These hot tiles should be kept in the cache buffer constantly rather than to replaced.  In fact, access to tiles satisfies some intrinsic laws. One example is Zipf-like laws, which indicate that the demand for tiles is extremely unbalanced: some 20% of the requested tiles may receive 80% of the total number of requests [ 10 , 11 ]. Another example is the spatial locality principle which shows the relationships among all tiles [ 12 ]. Such a priori knowledge can be used to find tiles that will be requested simultaneously and immediately (i.e., over a short period of time) after a certain tile is requested and then prefetch them proactively. It can be also used to determine which tiles those in the high-speed cache buffer will not be requested within a short time period and replace them to save cache space [ 13 , 14 ].  Obviously, all these intrinsic laws are driven by user access behaviors; therefore, knowledge of such behaviors can be used to optimize system performance [ 15 ]. The main idea behind this method, called a "user-driven" model (some researchers term this a trace-driven model [ 16 ]), is to find the relationships among all tiles according to historical access-log information (the logged data are called traces and are accumulated by GISs after long periods of use) and use that relationship information to determine which tiles should be prefetched or replaced based on their relationship with the next requested tile.  Many prefetching and cache replacement strategies based on user-driven models exist—each with its own algorithms for selecting the objects to be prefetched or replaced. Examples of such strategies include both client-side driven models that prefetch tiles from the client and server-side driven models that prefetch tiles from the server. For example, Retrospective Adaptive Prefetch (RAP) [ 17 ] is a client-side driven model, while Tile Prefetching Based on Previous k Movements (PKM) [ 18 ], the Basic Markov algorithm [ 19 ], Zipf’s cache strategy [ 20 ], Zipf’s Markov algorithm [ 21 ] and distributed high-speed caching based on spatial and temporal locality (DCST) [ 14 ] are all server-side driven models. Studies of all those models show that the algorithms based on user-driven models can improve the cache hit ratio compared to traditional algorithms.  Thus, there is sufficient evidence that users’ behavior is highly correlated with tile access; consequently, mining and using such correlations can help systems prefetch and cache tiles more accurately.    Related works  Unlike traditional prefetching and caching, a user-driven model fetches tiles and stores them before they are requested based on mining their popularity, or their relationships, or the user’s navigation path—and all those methods are based on users’ behavior.  In client-side prefetching, an application (i.e., a web browser) uses the most recent navigation path of a single individual client to estimate the tiles most likely to be requested next. RAP [ 17 ] constructs a heuristic method to predict a client’s next possible movements and then prefetches the tiles that correspond to those movements. RAP assumes that the user’s behavior will not change over a short period (i.e., a user zooming in may continue to zoom-in at the next step). If the user’s behavior changes, RAP launches a brand-new process. RAP uses internal memory to store cached tiles. However, the cache space is very limited; therefore, RAP clears 75% of the cache whenever it runs out of memory.  Server-side prefetching also mines access patterns based on a user’s behavior to find the pertinent relationships among tiles and then to predict and prefetch those objects that are most closely related to the tile being requested. For example, Hilbert Curve-based Prefetching (HCBP) [ 22 ] uses the Hilbert Curve to predict the next movement (neighboring tiles) from a user’s current state; PKM [ 18 ] also attempts to find the most likely tile among neighboring tiles by computing the transition probabilities between tiles and monitoring the previous k movements based on the user’s navigation path; finally PKM uses a Markov Chain to predict the objects to prefetch; Li (2010) [ 19 ] and Rui (2012) [ 21 ] both used a Markov Chain model to cache an optimum tile. Markov Chain models are constructed by setting the most recently accessed tiles as the initial state and then calculating the probabilities that its neighboring tiles will be requested as a state transition matrix.  However, all the above methods consider only neighboring tiles based on the user's current state—an approach that will introduce the problem of cache annihilation (CA) (i.e., the tiles cached by a one user may be replaced before they are accessed by those cached for another user because of the limited space available in the high-speed cache). Thus, some studies focus on global tiles, attempting to find the optimum choices among all tiles. Shi (2005) [ 20 ] calculated the popularity of all tiles and prefetched those with higher probabilities. Rui (2014) [ 14 ] also computed the popularity of all tiles and then used the scheme by which the United States Congress is elected to select which tiles to cache: a method called DCST. DCST used a steady-state cache-hit-ratio parameter to limit the tile selection range to save cache space and avoid cache pollution (CP). The authors of [ 16 ] proposed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), a method that used a linear combination of the geographic features and an ordinary least squares regression estimator to predict the user’s future behavior. Furthermore, they also proposed an improved method that used an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) to predict tile popularity [ 23 ].  Unfortunately, there are many high access probability hotspot tiles, and it is difficult to find the most appropriate hotspot tiles to cache. The access probability of all data can be computed by considering typical historical access-log information [ 24 ] such as the sequence “ GGGGEAFBCDABCDDDCDDDABCDDDCDDD .” Clearly, D has the highest probability of access in that sequence; C and G are smaller, and E, and F are rare. Thus, based on their access probability, we can prefetch and cache items D and C rather than B in advance when A is requested. However, we can also find that B is typically requested 1 or 2 steps after A is requested. In this case, even though C and D have higher access probabilities than B, B has a closer relationship with A; therefore, B should be prefetched and cached when A is requested.  Meanwhile, simply using tiles’ popularity or their relationships may not accurately represent a user’s behavior in all scenarios. For example, although some of data in the preceding sequence (i.e., E) have closer relationships with G, E does not need to be cached because it is unlikely to be requested again in the future.  Based on the above analyses, we propose a model that uses a brand-new method for combining tiles' popularity and their relationships. It also considers not only global users’ behavior but also global tile relationships. This approach avoids the problems of cache annihilation and cache pollution. The proposed algorithm is named global user-driven prefetching and caching mode (GUDC).    Global User-driven Models for Tile Prefetching  This model mines the correlation patterns of tiles based on their historical access-log information to prefetch data from the set of hotspot tiles and replace data in the high-speed cache buffer as needed. Investigating a typical example of access such as the sequence shown previously, it is clear that we can make some conclusions about tile correlations:   Tiles that are accessed simultaneously will have high correlations;  The more often tiles are requested simultaneously during a given timespan, the higher the correlations between them will be;  Short access distance intervals (i.e., the steps between two tiles when they are requested chronologically) indicate high correlations.   Thus, the key problem is how to construct a correlation expression model to represent these typical features. For simplicity, we first provide some basic definitions used by the algorithm.   Trace  For an individual user, there is a sequential navigation path of recorded tiles (the sequence of tiles that were requested by this individual. Similarly, we can sequentially investigate all users’ navigation paths for the entire system; this is called the historical access-log information (or simply referred to as trace information).    Access steps  This value indicates the number of steps between two tiles when they are requested sequentially. For example, if “ ABCD ” are requested sequentially, then the number of access steps between A and B is 1; the number of access steps between A and C is 2; and so on.    Fixed-access mode  A fixed access mode represents tiles that are usually accessed either sequentially or simultaneously. For example, “AB” and “CD” are two fixed-access modes based on typical historical access-log information [ 24 ].    Matching radius  A large access step value indicates a small correlation; thus, the matching radius denotes the largest access steps between tiles. When tiles' access steps are larger than the matching radius, their correlations are zero.    Hotspot tiles  Based on Zipf's law, only a small portion of the total tiles will be requested repeatedly [ 10 , 11 ]; these tiles are the hotspot tiles. To avoid invalid prefetching and reduce cache pollution, GUDC prefetches and caches only those hotspot tiles that meet the following restriction [ 20 ]:     N = K × h 1 / 1 − α ,    (1)  where K is the total number of all tiles (the tile set), N is the total number of hotspot tiles (a subset of the tile set), α is the Zipf distribution parameter and h is the steady-state cache hit ratio. The top N tiles can be selected as the hotspot tiles set by sorting all tiles based on their popularity from the trace information (or simply by computing the total number of accesses for each tile based on trace information).  In the next two sections, we will propose a simple correlation expression model first, and then, discuss a more complex model based on tiles’ fixed access modes.    Simple model  To construct a correlation expression model to represent the typical features mentioned above, a matching degree model is proposed that follows a conditional prefetching probability algorithm.  Denote T = { t 1 , t 2 ,⋯, t N } as the set of all hotspot tiles that will be accessed by all clients in GIS. Each element in T is labeled with a natural number [1, N ], where N is the total number of hotspot tiles. Then, let Q = ( q 1 , q 2 ,⋯, q L ) denote all the traces chronologically recorded by system after running for a long period, where q k ∈ [1, N ] denotes the label of the k- th most-requested tile (i.e., q k = i ( k = 1,⋯, L ) indicates that the k -th requested tile is t i ( i = 1,⋯, N )) and L is the total number of requests to all hotspot tiles.  If during a certain period t i is requested and—after x -steps— t j is also requested, then we denote that there is an x- step matching from t i to t j . Then, corresponding matching weights and matching steps can be denoted as w x and d x , respectively, where t i , t j ∈ T and d x = x , w x −1 > w x ( i , j ∈ [1, N ], i ≠ j ). If we denote n as the matching radius, then x ≤ n .  Moreover, for ∀ t i ∈ T ( i ∈ [1, N ]), we can obtain G i sub-vectors Q k ( i ) = ( q k 0 , q k 1 , q k 2 ,⋯, q kn ) ( q kx ∈ [1, N ], k ∈ [1, G i ], x ∈ [0, n ]), where q k 0 = i . Obviously, each sub-vector Q k ( i ) indicates which tiles are requested after t i and indicates their access steps with t i . Thus, the matching degrees from t i to t j based on a specific sub-vector Q k ( i ) can be stated as follows:     M k ( i , j ) = ∑ x = 0 n v k x ( i , j ) w x 1 ≤ i , j ≤ N ,    (2)  where     v k x ( i , j ) = { 1 q k x = j , j ≠ i 0 O t h e r s j ∈ [ 1 , N ] , k ∈ [ 1 , G i ] , x ∈ [ 0 , n ] ,    (3)  and their corresponding matching steps E k ( i , j ) and matching times F k ( i , j ) can be stated as follows:     E k ( i , j ) = ∑ x = 0 n v k x ( i , j ) d x 1 ≤ i , j ≤ N    (4)       F k ( i , j ) = ∑ x = 0 n v k x ( i , j ) 1 ≤ i , j ≤ N .    (5)   Considering the full set of sub-vectors Q ( i ) = { Q i ( i ) , Q 2 ( i ) , ⋯ , Q G i ( i ) } , the total matching degrees M ( i , j ) from t i to t j can be stated as follows:     M ( i , j ) = ∑ k = 1 G i M k ( i , j ) = ∑ k = 1 G i ∑ x = 0 n v k x ( i , j ) w x = V ( i , j ) ⋅ W 1 ≤ i , j ≤ N ,    (6)  where V ( i , j ) = ∑ k = 1 G i V k ( i , j ) and V k ( i , j ) = ( v k 0 ( i , j ), v k 1 ( i , j ), v k 2 ( i , j ),⋯, v kn ( i , j )) is the matching factor vector based on the sub-vector Q k ( i ), and W = ( w 0 , w 1 , w 2 ,⋯, w n ) represents the vector of matching weights. Then,     E ( i , j ) = ∑ k = 1 G i E k ( i , j ) = V ( i , j ) ⋅ D 1 ≤ i , j ≤ N and    (7)  and     F ( i , j ) = ∑ k = 1 G i F k ( i , j ) = ∑ k = 1 G i ‖ V k ( i , j ) ‖ 0 1 ≤ i , j ≤ N ,    (8)  where D = ( d 0 , d 1 , d 2 ,⋯, d n ) represents the matching steps vector, and the mathematical expression V ( i , j )∙ D is a dot product between vector V ( i , j ) and vector D .  Eq ( 6 ) provides the explicit probability of t i and t j being requested simultaneously. Eq ( 7 ) yields the access distance between t i and t j when they are requested during a short period, and Eq ( 8 ) represents the total number of times they are requested simultaneously. Therefore,     P → ( i , j ) = M ( i , j ) E ( i , j ) × F ( i , j ) 1 ≤ i , j ≤ N    (9)  indicates the total prefetch probability for t j when t i is requested (in other words, the probability that t j will be requested next).  A higher matching degree M ( i , j ) and/or a lower number of matching steps E ( i , j ) between t i and t j denotes a higher probability of t j being requested either simultaneously or immediately after t i is requested. In addition, a larger number of matching times F ( i , j ) can indicate a higher correlation between t i and t j . Therefore, Eq ( 9 ) can satisfy the three obvious conclusions presented previously concerning the correlations of tiles, and it can be used both to compute the correlations among tiles and to predict the next user request based on global users’ behavior. Thus, for ∀ t i ∈ T , we have     P s ( i , T ) = ( P → ( i , 1 ) , P → ( i , 2 ) , ⋯ , P → ( i , N ) ) ,    (10)  from which we can find the element that best predicts the corresponding tiles when t i is requested.    Complex model  Furthermore, many studies show that the access to tiles tends to follow a specific path (navigation path) [ 21 , 25 ], consequently, there are many fixed data access modes [ 26 ] and we can make predictions using only the last requested tile or we can employ knowledge of these fixed access modes to obtain a more rigorous and accurate forecast. A simple example is shown in Table 1 , where the trace comes from typical historical access-log information [ 24 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.t001  Table 1  An example of using different conditions to make predictions.           Conditions *  Prediction **      The last requested tile ( t i ) = D  The best choice is A or C or D    The last two tiles (× t i ) = CD  The best choice is A or D    The last three tiles (×× t i ) = BCD  The best choice is A or D    The last four tiles (××× t i ) = ABCD **  The best choice is D       * One or more tiles requested together are considered as a type of fixed access mode.  **Complex conditions can result in a more rigorous and more accurate forecast.    Similarly, for any fixed access mode A k ( i ) = ( f k 1 f k 2 ⋯ f k a k ) that ends with t i ,     P → ( A k ( i ) , j ) = M ( A ( i ) , j ) E ( A ( i ) , j ) × F ( A k ( i ) , j ) 1 ≤ i , j ≤ N    (11)  yields a conditional prefetch probability for t j when a series of tiles were requested sequentially based on the fixed access mode A k ( i ) over a short time period, where f k a k = i indicates that the last requested tile is t i , a kl ∈ [1, N ] ( l ∈ [1, a k ], a k ≤ n , k ∈ [1, C i ]), a k is the length of the fixed access mode A k ( i ), and C i is the total number of all fixed access modes that end with t i .  Thus, for ∀ t i ∈ T , we can obtain a conditional prefetch probability matrix for all tiles based on all possible fixed access modes that end with tile t i . The matrix can be notated as follows:     P ( A ( i ) , T ) = [ P → ( A 1 ( i ) , 1 ) P → ( A 1 ( i ) , 2 ) ⋯ P → ( A 1 ( i ) , N ) P → ( A 2 ( i ) , 1 ) P → ( A 2 ( i ) , 2 ) ⋯ P → ( A 2 ( i ) , N ) ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ P → ( A C i ( i ) , i ) P → ( A C i ( i ) , 2 ) ⋯ P → ( A C i ( i ) , N ) ]    (12)  where A ( i ) = { A 1 ( i ) , A 2 ( i ) , ⋯ , A C i ( i ) } represents the set of all fixed access modes that end with t i . Here, P s ( i , T ) denotes a specific row of P ( A ( i ), T ) when its fixed access mode A k ( i ) has only one element( i ).    Tile prefetching strategy  As shown in Table 1 , the purpose of tile prefetching is to find the best choice to anticipate the user's next movement. Eq ( 12 ) shows how to compute the conditional prefetching probabilities for all tiles. Thus, tile prefetching strategies can be stated as follows:   Step 1: Sequentially record the indexes of all tiles requested by all users. After the system has been running for a sufficiently long time, these indexes constitute a historical record denoted as trace Q all .  Step 2: Obtain the set of hotspot tiles set T based on trace Q all using Eq ( 1 ). Then, delete all the labels of unpopular tiles from Q all . The result is a hotspot tiles trace Q .  Step 3: Sequentially record the index of the most recently requested n tiles and denote them as Q s = ( q s1 , q s 2 ,⋯, q sn ), where t q s n is the tile being requested.  Step 4: Based on trace Q , obtain the fixed access mode set A ( q sn ) and then compute the prefetching probability matrix P ( A ( q sn ), T ) for all tiles based on Eq ( 12 ).  Step 5: Let S ( q s n ) = ( s 1 ( q s n ) , s 2 ( q s n ) , ⋯ , s C q s n ( q s n ) ) denote the fixed access modes matching indicator of tile t q s n based on the fixed access mode A ( q s n ) = ( A 1 ( q s n ) , A 2 ( q s n ) , ⋯ , A C q s n ( q s n ) ) , where C q s n is the number of fixed access modes that end with t q s n . Then, s k ( q sn ) ( k ∈ [ 1 , C q s n ] ) can be shown as follows:       s k ( q s n ) = { 1 A k ( q s n ) i s a s u b v e c t o r o f Q s 0 O t h e r s k ∈ [ 1 , C q s n ] .    (13)   Eq ( 13 ) indicates that if we can find a certain fixed access mode from the current access states Q s then its corresponding fixed access modes matching indicator can be assigned to 1; otherwise, we assign it to zero. Here is a simple example that can be found from the trace discussed above [ 24 ]. If we assume that the current access state Q s = ( ABCD ), then the tile currently being accessed is D (the last element in Q s ). Further, assume that all the fixed access modes of D are A ( D ) = (( D ),( AD ),( ABD ),( ABCD )). Thus, from Eq ( 13 ), we obtain S ( D ) = (1,0,0,1). Then, using Eq ( 12 ) and Eq ( 13 ), we can calculate the total conditional prefetching probability, which is stated as follows:     P f ( q s n , T ) = [ ∑ l = 1 C q s n P → ( A l ( q s n ) , 1 ) s l ( q s n ) ∑ l = 1 C q s n P → ( A l ( q s n ) , 2 ) s l ( q s n ) ⋮ ∑ l = 1 C q s n P → ( A l ( q s n ) , N ) s l ( q s n ) ] T = S ( q s n ) ⋅ P ( A ( q s n ) , T ) q s n ∈ [ 1 , N ]    (14)   Eq ( 14 ) shows the total conditional prefetching probabilities based on all the fixed access modes A ( q sn ) that are a dot product between vector S ( q sn ) and matrix P ( A ( q sn ), T ). Therefore, the largest element from P f ( q sn , T ) will have the highest probability of being requested next by all users, and we can prefetch its corresponding tile (i.e., if the second item is the largest element in P f ( q sn , T ), then prefetch t 2 ).   Step 6: Add Q s to the end of Q and update Q and P ( A ( q sn ), T ).  Step 7: Repeat Steps 3–7 when the system receives a new request.  Step 8: The tile prefetching algorithm is complete.   Moreover, if we denote the abovementioned method as a 1-step data prefetching strategy, then the m -steps data prefetching strategy seeks to obtain m tiles that have higher total conditional prefetching probabilities based on Eq ( 14 ). Thus, we can use the m -steps data prefetching strategy to prefetch more tiles to reduce the computational load and the number of scheduling times.    Tile replacement strategy  Due to the limited high-speed cache space on servers, another important factor in achieving a high cache-hit rate is to remove the most appropriate data to free cache space on the server using a data replacement strategy. Many classical data replacement algorithms such as FIFO, LRU, and least frequently used (LFU) are widely used in numerous fields [ 27 , 28 , 29 ] and Google [ 7 ], NASA [ 8 ] and NGISs [ 9 ] have all used the LRU algorithm to achieve good performance in their server systems. The authors of [ 30 ] proposed the Lowest Value First Cache Replacement for Geospatial Data (GDLVF), a type of lowest value-first cache replacement algorithm for geospatial data caching that comprehensively considers the influence of many factors, including not only access time and access frequency but also the size of the data size and its location. However, research shows that we can achieve a high hit rate even with a simple LRU technique if we simply group the cache queues [ 31 ].  The above analysis is still lacking in that we should consider not only the data itself but also the relationships within the data. Therefore, this article provides a method that comprehensively considers both the global users’ behaviors and all tiles’ relationships based on a unified algorithm model for scheduling tile replacement.  Similar to the tile prefetching strategy, after obtaining trace Q , we can schedule tile replacement using the following steps:   Step 1: Sequentially record the indexes of the last n cached tiles and denotes the set as Q c = ( q c1 , q c 2 ,⋯, q cn ), where t q c n is the tile being prefetched and stored into the high-speed cache.  Step 2: Obviously, the last-cached data must be the last-requested data. Thus, we have t q c n = t q s n and A ( q cn ) = A ( q sn ). Set P c ( A ( q cn ), T ) = P ( A ( q sn ), T )( q cn ∈ [1, N ]) and delete the columns from P c ( A ( q cn ), T ) in which the corresponding tiles are not cached (i.e., if tile t i is not stored in the high-speed cache buffer, then delete the i -th column). Thus, the corresponding tiles of P c ( A ( q cn ), T ) are the only tiles stored in the high-speed cache buffer.  Step 3: Similar to Step 5 in the previous section, calculate S ( q cn ) based on tile t q c n and Q c . Then, using Eqs ( 12 ) and ( 13 ), we can obtain a total conditional caching replacement probability, which can be stated as follows:       P c ( q c n , T ) = S ( q c n ) ⋅ P c ( A ( q c n ) , T ) q c n ∈ [ 1 , N ] .    (15)   Eq ( 15 ) yields the total conditional caching replacement probabilities based on all fixed access modes; therefore, by finding the smallest one (which has the lowest probability of being requested next by all users) and deleting its corresponding tiles from the high-speed cache buffer, we can save cache space (i.e., if the second item is the smallest element in P c ( q cn , T ), delete t 2 from the cache buffer).   Step 4: Repeat Steps 1–4 when the system prefetches and caches a new tile.  Step 5: The tile caching replacement algorithm is complete.   Using the same logic as the tile prefetching strategy, we can also delete m tiles from high-speed cache buffer based on an m -step cache replacement strategy.    Algorithm analysis  A theoretical analysis shows that GUDC must compute the total conditional prefetching probability matrix for all tiles based on the full trace information Q . Therefore, GUDC has an initial time complexity of O ( N 3 L ). Because there are large numbers of datasets (large N ) and a plethora of trace information, Q (large L ), it is impossible to calculate the conditional prefetching probability matrix in real time; consequently, we must dynamically count and compute matching degrees, matching weights and matching steps for each segment of all the trace information while the system is running. Subsequently, the total conditional prefetching probability matrix can easily be computed by adding all these items based on Eq 6 , Eq 7 and Eq 8 after sufficient trace information has been obtained.     Parameters and Metrics  The proposed method includes two parameters that must be determined: the matching radius n and the matching weights vector W . The matching radius n indicates the correlation depth or the navigation depth, which indicates whether the next n movements still have an influence. In this case, Serdar (2012) [ 17 ] gives a detailed proposal for navigation depths of approximately 5 to 10; in this case, n will vary from 2.5 to 5 considering the symmetry of influence. Therefore, in this article, we can set n to 5.  Furthermore, research shows that clients’ requests for tiles satisfy a type of Poisson distribution [ 32 ]. If we set the Poisson distribution parameter λ = 2 n (the navigation depth), then we can assume it is a Gaussian distribution, which can be stated as follows:     w ( x ) = exp ( − ( x − μ ) 2 2 σ 2 ) ,    (16)  where μ can be defined as zero. Then, 95.5% of the effects on a certain tile come from the tiles in which the correlations depth is less than μ +1.96 σ (the Gaussian area between μ -1.96 σ and μ +1.96 σ is 95.5% of the total area). Thus, we can obtain an optimum σ = 2.6( n /1.96) and using that, we can compute and obtain a matching weights vector W . The outputs can then be normalized so that all values fall into the interval [0, 1], satisfying the requirement of the expression model.  In comparison, most similar studies have used the cache-hit ratio (CHR) as the metric for evaluating the prefetch caching performance [ 23 ], while some additionally used the average request-response time [ 13 ], the effect of network bandwidth [ 18 ], refresh time [ 17 ] or the byte-hit ratio [ 8 ].  The cache-hit ration is defined as the ratio of the number of requests hit in the cache to the total number of cache requests; therefore, obviously, a larger cache-hit ratio reflects a faster average request response time when considering identical systems (i.e., those using identical software and hardware such as Google Earth) and also represents a faster refresh speed or a higher efficient of network bandwidth. Meanwhile, byte-hit ratio is yet another way of expressing CHR. The byte-hit ratio is affected by the sizes of cached tiles or the cache space rather than by the algorithms themselves. Therefore, in this article, we use only one metric—CHR—to evaluate the simulations and experiments.    Simulations and Experiments   Simulation design  To illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in this paper, we selected our method and some typical methods for comparison:   the global user-driven model for tile prefetching proposed in this article, GUDC;  The method described in [ 14 ], which adopts a fair allocation scheme called the proportional distribution election scheme for the United States Congress and a replication strategy for distributed high-speed caching based on spatial and temporal locality (DCST);  The method described in [ 18 ], which computes the transition probabilities between tiles and prefetches the most likely neighbors using a type of previous k movements algorithm (PKM);  The method described in [ 19 ], which uses a basic Markov Chain model to cache optimum tiles, called the Basic Markov method (BM);  The method described in [ 20 ], which calculates the popularity of all tiles and prefetches those tiles with higher probabilities based on Zipf 's law, called the Zipf Law (ZL) method;  The method described in [ 21 ] that uses a Zipf-like law based on a Markov Chain model to cache optimum tiles, called the Zipf-like Markov method (ZM);   Among these methods, GUDC and DCST can be used to predict requests from multiple users, while all the others are designed to predict only a single user’s behavior. Therefore, comparisons will be made only between GUDC and DCST for multi-user behaviors, and among GUDC, DCST, BM, ZL and ZM based on single user’s behavior.  Based on the analyses discussed above, tile prefetching strategies can be employed on both the server side and client side. Therefore, GUDC will also be implemented as a client-side prefetch method and compared with other client-side algorithms such as (RAP) [ 17 ].  Because the Zipf-like distribution parameter α can vary significantly, from 0.60 to 1.03 [ 33 ], these experiments adopted values of 0.600, 0.750, 0.815, 0.971 and 1.03 for α in simulating requests for tiles using GlobeSIGht [ 11 ] and to demonstrate the adaptability of the proposed method to the behavior of different users.  For the proposed method, another factor that affects performance is the prefetching steps mentioned at the ends of the previous two sections. Because the best choice for the matching radius is approximately 2.5 to 5, these experiments adopted a prefetching step value of 3, which the means that GUDC will prefetch 3 more tiles whenever a certain tile is requested. We also considered some other choices for the prefetch step value; the corresponding tests are shown below.  Furthermore, to validate the adaptability of the proposed method to different parameters, we conducted some comparative experiments using different matching radii (which vary from 1 to 14), different prefetching steps (which vary from 1 to 10), and different cache replacement strategies (which include the GUDC method, the FIFO algorithm and the LRU algorithm).    Data sources  The experiments are driven by trace data simulated by accessing SRTM90 (the 90-meter-resolution global terrain data files from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data. All tile requests obey a Zipf-like distribution and are accessed through GlobeSIGht [ 11 ], which is an earth observation system similar to Google Earth or NASA World Wind. The requests to servers also obey a Poisson distribution [ 32 ].  This study selects some tiles of a certain area of China as the objects to be accessed. The datasets include between 55,242 and 663,552 tiles; however, most requests focus on subsets of the hotspot tiles due to Zipf's law.  The traces include two parts: one is used for training (to compute and find the user-driven model for tile prefetching) and the other is used to test the model validity. Each part of the complete traces includes approximately 2–20 million requests for all the hotspot tiles.  The dataset statistics and the number of requests contained in the traces are summarized in Table 2 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.t002  Table 2  The datasets parameters used in the experiments.           Parameters  Value      Dataset name  SRTM90    Data size  55242 ~ 663552 *    Number of trace  2 for each data size    Trace size  2 million ~ 20 million **       *Based on the Zipf-like laws, only subsets of the hotspot tiles will be requested.  **The traces record only the labels of requested tiles in chronological order.      The workflow of experiments  The steps to validate the global user-driven cache algorithm were as follows:   Using the first portion of the trace information, a correlation matrix and tile popularities were computed;  Tiles with higher popularity were prefetched and cached in advance, based on the available cache space;  The second part of the trace information was used as a simulation of users’ requests for all hotspot tiles. During the simulation, certain tiles are prefetched and cached; simultaneously, and other tiles in the cache are replaced to save cache space using the various scheduling algorithms mentioned above;  For GUDC, the correlation matrix is updated based on the second part of the trace to follow changes in users’ behaviors;  For all simulated accesses, the total number of requests hit in the cache was counted, and finally, the cache-hit ratio was calculated.  Moreover, the total number of disk accesses was also counted. Then, disk access ratios were computed.     Experimental results and discussion  There are three kinds of prefetching modes: multi-user mode , single-user mode and client-side mode .  Multi-user mode is a global mode that predicts a user's next movement based on the behavior of all users rather than the behavior of a single user.  Fig 1 gives the performances for GUDC, DCST and the No-Prefetching strategy (NP), based on the multi-user mode and measured by the CHR, where the distribution parameter α = 0.600. All these algorithms are driven by the global user behavior. GUDC and DCST created an initial cache based on their own algorithm rules. Among these algorithms, GUDC uses the tile replacement strategy proposed in this article to delete tiles from the high-speed cache buffer to save cache space, while DCST, based on its algorithm strategy, uses the LRU strategy to delete tiles from the high-speed cache buffer. NP simply caches the tile being accessed; it never prefetches tiles in advance. NP uses the LRU and FIFO strategies to delete tiles from the high-speed cache buffer.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.g001  Fig 1   Comparative CHRs obtained from different prefetching algorithms based on multi-user mode.     As shown in Fig 1 , the performance of all algorithms improves as the number of cached tiles increases because a greater number of cached tiles increases the possibilities for cache hits. However, due to DCST's cache space saving method, the hit-rate changes only negligibly when the cached tile ratio is above 36% (when α = 0.600). In this case, GUDC's performance exceeds that of DCST by approximately 15% when the cached tile ratio is less than 36%, and expands to 27.5% when the cached tile ratio is increased. In addition, GUDC provides obvious performance advantages over the traditional algorithms of FIFO and LRU ranging from 38.7% ~ 51.9% under all experimental conditions.  Single-user mode is very different from multi-user mode because it considers only the behavior of one particular user to predict the next movement based on the user’s current observation location.  Fig 2 shows the performances of GUDC, DCST, ZM, ZL and BM in single-user mode as measured by the CHR, where the distribution parameter is α = 0.815. GUDC and DCST are driven by global user behavior, and the others are driven by a single user’s behavior. All the algorithms in this experiment except GUDC used the LRU cache replacement strategy.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.g002  Fig 2   Comparative CHRs obtained from different prefetching algorithms based on single-user mode.     As shown in Fig 2 , just as in the first experiment ( Fig 1 ), the performance of all algorithms improves as the number of cached tiles increases. In addition, GUDC achieves a better performance than ZM (by approximately 11.4%), ZL (by approximately 30.7%), and BM (by approximately 110.5%). In this case, DCST achieves a higher CHR than ZM, ZL and BM when the cached tile ratio is less than 42% (when α = 0.815), but—for the same reason—its performance advantages diminish as the cached tile ratio increases.  Finally, to investigate GUDC’s performance when implemented as a client-side prefetching and caching scheme, a comparative experiment was performed based on client-side cache mode. The performance comparison of different algorithms is shown in Table 3 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.t003  Table 3  A performance comparison of various algorithms based on the client-side prefetching mode.             Algorithms  Average cache hit ratio (CHR) (%)  Cache space (tiles)  CHR based on normalized cache space (1 tile) (%)      GUDC  56.55%  1000  0.05655    DCST  50.22%  1000  0.05022    ZM  47.83%  1000  0.04783    ZL  34.85%  1000  0.03485    BM  25.08%  1000  0.02508    RAP  50.33%  984  0.05115    PKM  29.41%  1041  0.02825       Due to the limited cache space, algorithms based on client-side cache mode can cache only a limited number of tiles. RAP removes 75% of the oldest tiles from the cache to save cache space; therefore, it has a minimum cache space occupancy ratio. After normalizing cache space to the same benchmark, the performances based on this normalized cache space is computed and shown in the 4th column, which indicates that GUDC achieves the best performance, improving on RAP (which is designed specifically for client-side cache mode) by approximately 10.6%.  To demonstrate the changes in GUDC's performance based on different Zipf-like distributions, a comparison is shown in Fig 3 in which the distribution parameter α changed substantially, from 0.600 to 1.030 (the maximum interval is [0.600–1.03]).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.g003  Fig 3   Comparative CHRs obtained from GUDC based on different global user behaviors.     As shown in Fig 3 , the performance of GUDC improves as the distribution parameter α increases because a larger distribution parameter represents a more concentrated access distribution and, therefore, requires fewer hotspot tiles to be cached. As the distribution parameter increases, the performance improves by an average of approximately 18.5% each time the distribution parameter α increases by approximately 10%.  Furthermore, if we denote ( CHR i - CHR 1 )/ CHR 1 as the performance improvement of GUDC with different data sizes, Fig 4 illustrates the experimental results using different cached tile ratios ( Cr ). In Fig 4 , CHR 1 represents the first performance value based on the first data size and CHR i indicates the performance value resulting from other data sizes.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.g004  Fig 4   Comparative CHRs obtained from GUDC based on different data sizes.     From Fig 4 , it is apparent that the performance improves stably and that a smaller cached tile ratio increase the rate of performance improvement. Through testing and analysis, we found that GUDC can cache more hotspot tiles under the same cached tile ratio as the data size increases. Then, GUDC obtains a higher cache-hit probability, which stably improves the performance as the data size increases. At the same time, comprehensively considering the experimental results in Fig 1 and Fig 3 , which show that a smaller cached tile ratio results in lower CHRs as well as that smaller data size result in lower CHRs, it is more difficult to improve GUDC’s performance further because it is very high already.  In contrast, the performance can be improved by increasing the data size, but the same cached tile ratio will lead to a larger cache space demand as well as increased computational complexity because a more massive hotspot dataset must be computed. Thus, in future work, we plan to investigate a way of grouping the tiles to reduce the computational cost while still maintaining GUDC's performance.  Additionally, it is obvious that increasing the number of prefetching steps means more tiles will be cached each time; consequently, we can improve the probabilities of preparing data for the next move in advance. Fig 5 shows the contrast in GUDC's performances with different numbers of prefetching steps (from approximately 1 to 10 tiles, corresponding to 1 to 10 prefetching steps).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.g005  Fig 5   Comparative CHRs obtained from GUDC using different prefetching steps.     Fig 5 shows that the performance can be improved by increasing the number of prefetching steps when the cache space is relatively small, but results in only negligible changes when the number of steps expands beyond 3. The experiment results show that GUDC can accurately represent short-term burst demands among the tiles; therefore, the algorithm achieves better performance using a small number of prefetching steps that reduces the computational complexity. Even a single step is sufficient to obtain a high performance when a large high-speed cache space is available.  Tile prefetching and cache replacement are two factors that can help optimize GIS performance. Most algorithms focus only on the prefetching model while using traditional methods to calculate cache replacement. To evaluate the performance of GUDC's cache replacement algorithm, we performed a comparative experiment using the GUDC cache replacement algorithm, the FIFO replacement strategy, and the LRU replacement strategy, as shown in Fig 6 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.g006  Fig 6   Comparative CHRs obtained from GUDC using different cache replacement strategies.     Similar to the experiment in Fig 5 , the performance can be improved by using GUDC cache replacement strategy when the cache space is relatively small. For the same reasons, being able to accurately follow short-term bursts to avoid incorrectly deleting tiles from the cache that will be requested next, has a particularly heavy impact on performance when the cache space is relatively small. From the experimental results shown in Fig 6 , we can use the GUDC cache replacement algorithm when the cache space is small or the LRU cache replacement algorithm when the cache space is large to simultaneously reduce computational complexity and obtain high performance.  Because the matching radius, n , is another important parameter that can be used to determine the numbers of related tiles, we performed a comparative experiment using different matching radii to compute the matching degrees. This approach results in different total conditional prefetching probability matrix for making predictions and prefetching. A comparison of the results is shown in Table 4 , where the distribution parameter α = 0.600 and the cached tile ratio was 18%.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.t004  Table 4  Comparative CHRs and disk access ratio based on different matching radius.            Matching radius ( n )  Disk access ratio (%)  Average cache hit ratio (CHR) (%)      1  94.77%  48.27%    3  86.92%  48.36%    5  85.23%  48.56%    14  89.62%  48.39%       The 2 nd column in Table 4 lists the disk access ratio performance, which is the ratio of the total number of disk accesses (which occurs when the cache is missed and during active prefetching) to the total number of requests from users, and presents the resource cost of the proposed algorithm. The 3rd column shows the CHR performances. Obviously, a lower disk access ratio indicates fewer disk accesses as well as reduced resource consumption. Table 4 sows that the algorithm achieves its best performance based on the designed matching radius (where n = 5). Although only small changes occur in the CHRs as the matching radius varies from 1 to 14 (the typical navigation depth is approximately 5 to 10 [ 17 ]), the resource cost of the algorithm based on the designed matching radius is the lowest: it reduces the disk access ratio by approximately 4.38%.  Furthermore, to compare the resource costs of different algorithms, a comparative experiment was also conducted using GUDC, DCST and two traditional algorithms. The experimental results are shown in Fig 7 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170195.g007  Fig 7   Comparative disk access performance obtained from different algorithms.     As Fig 7 shows, GUDC and DCST achieve better disk access ratios than do the two traditional algorithms. Due to limited cache space and maintaining a higher cache hit ratio, GUDC must continually update the cached tiles by prefetching tiles from disk, while DCST simply stores tile being requested into the cache and never actively prefetches data from the disk. Considering the experimental results shown in Fig 1 and Fig 7 , the performance gap in disk access ratio can be reduced by increasing the size of the high-speed cache space, which also narrows the CHR performance gap. Moreover, GUDC can continue to reduce disk access ratio by increasing high-speed cache space until, at some point it can be ignored. In contrast, DCST’s disk access ratio cannot be reduced further by increasing the high-speed cache size.     Conclusions and Future Works  Web geographical information system is a typical service-intensive application which must store massive data into storage nodes and service large numbers of users. Instead of reading tiles from storage in real-time on-the-fly, prefetching and caching tiles that will be requested in the future can reduce the response time of GIS services and substantially improve the quality of service. In server-side cache mode, prefetching and caching tiles can prepare data for servers in advance to reduce the latency of accessing slower disks. In client-side mode, prefetching and caching can be used to reduce the amount of data repeatedly transferred over short periods to save network bandwidth. However, it is difficult to predict the appropriate tiles to prefetch and cache both because of the massive sizes of the datasets as well as the limited space available in high-speed caches. This type of situation requires a more effective method for finding tiles’ inner relationships to trace and predict the next movements of users.  Because access to tiles involves some intrinsic laws that can be mined from historical access records, this study proposed a type of correlation expression method for all tiles that reflects the features of all users’ access behaviors. Then and a global user-driven model for all tile prefetching and cache replacement activities is proposed based on the proposed correlation expression method. This proposed algorithm solves two key problems found in the Zipf’s Markov [ 21 ] and DCST [ 14 ] algorithms as discussed in the Related Works section of this paper. First, we consider not only tile popularity but also access correlations among tiles. Second, we mine the global access correlations of all tiles through analyzing global user access behaviors to avoid the problem of cache annihilation (CA) and cache pollution (CP). Finally, our algorithm uses the same strategy to perform tile prefetching and cache replacements to realize their coordination. Thus, the proposed integration of the prefetching and caching algorithm can maintain tiles in the cache that are the most likely objects to be requested next while symmetrically removing tiles from the high-speed cache buffer that are the least likely objects to be requested in the future. This global user-driven model is trained (or mined) using historical traces that better describe the relationships among the tiles than the approaches of other proposed algorithms.  In addition, the performance of the proposed method was demonstrated through a series of comparative experiments. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can not only effectively predict the next movements of users in multi-user environments but also adapt to the behaviors of single users. Finally, the proposed GUDC approach can also achieve good results when used for client-side caching.  In total, the method proposed in this study achieves better performance than that of other algorithms in all respects, including approximately a 15.0% ~ 51.9% improvement in multi-user mode, which has recently become one of the most popular research directions, approximately a 11.4% ~ 110.5% improvement in single-user mode, which has attracted many research efforts in the past, and approximately a 10.6% improvement in client-side cache mode, which usually involves limited cache space.  However, the algorithm proposed in this article also requires large trace sizes to achieve a good correlation matrix that closely represents the relationships among tiles. Such large amounts of trace information cannot be guaranteed for new systems. Therefore, in future work, we plan to develop a type of composite method that uses only a user's current status to make predictions when a system is new, but then switches to using traces to mine the relationships among data after sufficient traces are available. Meanwhile, aiming at the drawbacks of conventional distributed computing in computing-intensive application [ 34 ], an integrated method that comprehensively considers computational efficiency and access speed also needs to be developed.

We studied the phylogeography and historical demography of the most generalist digenean from cetaceans, Pholeter gastrophilus , exploring the effects of isolation by distance, ecological barriers and hosts’ dispersal ability on the population structure of this parasite. The ITS2 rDNA, and the mitochondrial COI and ND1 from 68 individual parasites were analysed. Worms were collected from seven oceanic and coastal cetacean species from the south western Atlantic (SWA), central eastern Atlantic, north eastern Atlantic (NEA), and Mediterranean Sea. Pholeter gastrophilus was considered a single lineage because reciprocal monophyly was not detected in the ML cladogram of all individuals, and sequence variability was <1% for mtDNA and 0% for ITS2. These results rule out a recent suggestion that P . gastrophilus would actually be a cryptic-species complex. The genetic cohesion of P . gastrophilus could rely on the extensive exploitation of wide-ranging and highly mobile cetaceans, with a putative secondary role, if any, of intermediate hosts. Unique haplotypes were detected in SWA and NEA, and an AMOVA revealed significant population structure associated to the genetic variation in these regions. The Equator possibly acts as a significant geographical barrier for cetacean movements, possibly limiting gene flow between northern and southern populations of P . gastrophilus . A partial Mantel tests revealed that the significant isolation of NEA populations resulted from geographic clustering. Apparently, the limited mobility of cetaceans used by P . gastrophilus as definitive hosts in this region, coupled with oceanographic barriers and a patchy distribution of potential intermediate hosts could contribute to significant ecological isolation of P . gastrophilus in NEA. Rather unexpectedly, no genetic differentiation was found in the Mediterranean samples of this parasite. Historical demographic analyses suggested a recent population expansion of P . gastrophilus in the Atlantic Ocean, perhaps linked to initial association and subsequent spreading in cetaceans.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003339  Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas    CGL/2009/07465   Mercedes Fernández        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003339  Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas    CGL/2012/39545   Francisco Javier Aznar        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003359  Generalitat Valenciana    PROMETEO II/2015/018   Juan Antonio Raga     This study was supported by projects CGL/2009/07465, CGL/2012/39545 and AGL2015-68405-R (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Spain), and PROMETEO II/2015/018 (Generalitat Valenciana, Spain).

Free-living stages, i.e. the miracium and the cercaria, have a limited capacity for dispersal, whereas other stages use invertebrates (usually molluscs) as first intermediate hosts, other invertebrates or vertebrates as second intermediate hosts, and vertebrates as definitive hosts [ 1 ]. Consequently, gene flow in digeneans is largely determined by the dispersal ability of the most mobile host, which usually is the definitive host [ 2 ]. This is particularly true in the marine environment where few barriers for gene flow presumably exist [ 3 ] and, therefore, the dispersal role of hosts is particularly important. Although studies on phylogeography of marine parasites are still scarce [ 2 ], evidence suggests contrasting patterns of genetic structure depending on host mobility [ 4 , 5 ].  Cetaceans harbour a diverse fauna of digeneans and represent an interesting model for phylogeographical analysis because they are long-ranging animals that often undergo seasonal migrations between feeding and breeding grounds [ 6 ]. The high dispersal capacity of many oceanic cetaceans results in little genetic differentiation of their populations (e.g., [ 7 , 8 , 9 ]), although geographical barriers may contribute to population structure in some cases [ 10 , 11 ]. In contrast, cetacean species that are more restricted to neritic waters are known to experience ecological barriers that tend to promote more isolation and local adaptation of populations [ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ]. How dispersal patterns of cetaceans shape the population structure of their digenean parasites is an open question. As far as we are aware, there is a single study that has investigated the phylogeography and genetic structure of a digenean from cetaceans. Marigo et al. [ 16 ] described the genetic structure of Synthesium pontoporiae , which is specific to the Franciscana dolphin, Pontoporia blainvillei . This largely sedentary cetacean has a relatively restricted geographic range occurring along the temperate coasts of southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. Although there was significant genetic subdivision of Franciscanas at a regional scale [ 15 ], no genetic differentiation was found for S . pontoporiae , which suggests that the dispersal capacity of the (unknown) intermediate hosts would most likely have overcome the low vagility of definitive hosts and contributed to the genetic mixing of S . pontoporiae populations [ 16 ].  The most generalist and geographically widespread digenean exclusive to cetaceans is Pholeter gastrophilus , which has been reported in at least 17 species of oceanic and coastal dolphins and porpoises ( Table 1 ). A recent phylogenetic study has confirmed that this species belongs to the family Heterophyidae [ 17 ]. Pholeter gastrophilus is distributed in the North and South Atlantic Ocean, as well as in the Mediterranean, Black and North Seas ( S1 Fig ). Remarkably, in the Pacific Ocean just a few reports exist in the Peruvian coast and South Australia and, in the Indian Ocean, sampling is restricted to the Red Sea ( S1 Fig ). The identity of the intermediate hosts of P . gastrophilus is unknown but, based on data from other marine heterophyids [ 1 , 18 ], it can be postulated that eggs are eaten by a gastropod (1st intermediate host), from which cercariae emerge, penetrating and encysting in fish (2nd intermediate host) that serve as prey for cetaceans (definitive host). Evidence indicates that P . gastrophilus readily infects both sympatric coastal and oceanic dolphins that have largely non-overlapping diets, which would suggest that this parasite is able to extensively exploit the food web to reach its definitive hosts [ 19 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0170184.t001  Table 1  Reports of cetacean species infected by the digenean Pholeter gastrophilus .

(*) This fresh water record requires further confirmation.    The extensive geographical and ecological distribution of P . gastrophilus has raised the possibility that it may actually represent a complex of sibling species [ 38 ]. Cryptic speciation has been reported in many marine invertebrates with wide geographical distributions [ 59 ], including generalist helminths from cetaceans [ 60 ] and from other marine vertebrates [ 61 ]. For instance, digenean species of Transversotrema that infect sedentary fish in the Great Barrier have undergone cryptic speciation associated to limited dispersal of both hosts and parasites [ 62 ]. To date, no study has addressed the issue of cryptic speciation in P . gastrophilus .  Assuming that P . gastrophilus is a single species, it would be still important to investigate the influence of host mobility in providing genetic structure (or lack of it) to its populations. One could expect that the potentially high dispersal ability of its cetacean hosts could lead to little genetic structure in P . gastrophilus . This has been observed, for instance, in other geographically widespread marine parasites, such as the acanthocephalan Profilicollis altmani , which also infects highly vagile definitive hosts, i.e. marine birds [ 5 ]. However, gene flow in P . gastrophilus could be restricted, at least between some populations, due to limits for host dispersal at vast geographical scales (i.e. thousand km), land barriers between ocean basins, and/or the exploitation of some host species with reduced mobility (i.e. sedentary hosts).  In this study we analysed phylogeographic patterns of P . gastrophilus using ribosomal and mitochondrial markers. Although collection of specimens was limited by opportunistic sampling, we could obtain samples from a wide geographical range (i.e., South Atlantic, North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea), and from cetaceans with contrasting ecology (i.e., oceanic and highly vagile or coastal and sedentary). The research questions we addressed were the following: 1) Does P . gastrophilus represent one or several species? 2) What is the role (if any) of isolation by distance (Southern vs. Northern Hemisphere), land barriers (Mediterranean vs. Atlantic localities) and host mobility (sedentary vs. highly migratory cetacean species) in providing genetic structure to populations of this species?    Materials and Methods   Parasite collection and study design  A total of 68 specimens of P . gastrophilus was collected from the stomach of 55 stranded individuals of seven cetacean species, i.e., striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba ; bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus ; short-beaked common dolphin, Delphinus delphis ; short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus ; long-finned pilot whale, G . melas ; Atlantic white-sided dolphin, Lagenorhynchus acutus , and harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena , in nine localities ( Table 2 ). Permission to collect dead stranded dolphins was given by the wildlife service of regional governments in each locality, specifically the Secretary of Tourism and Wildlife Service of Chubut Province and the Government Agencies of Río Negro and Buenos Aires Provinces (Argentina); the Royal Institute of Natural Sciences of Belgium; the Ministry of Energy, Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Areas of Schleswig-Holstein (Germany); the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Ireland), and the Wildlife Services of the Valencian, Andalucian, Galician and Canarian Regional Governments (Spain). No ethics board was involved because animals were collected after their natural death. Worms were collected from the stomach of cetaceans and stored in either 70% or 96% ethanol for further molecular analyses. The nine sampling localities are hierarchically organised into four regions according to their proximity, i.e., 1) Mediterranean Sea (Med), which included samples from the Alboran Sea and the western Mediterranean (Spain); 2) south western Atlantic (SWA), with samples from the coast of Argentina; 3) north eastern Atlantic Ocean (NEA), with samples from the Celtic Sea and the North Sea (Ireland, Belgium and Germany); and 4) central eastern Atlantic (CEA), with samples from the coast of Galicia (north-west Spain), the Strait of Gibraltar, and the Canary Islands (Spain) ( Fig 1 ). Geographical coordinates of each sampling locality are specified in S1 Table . The coast of Galicia was included in the CEA because all worms were collected from short-finned pilot whales, after an exceptional mass stranding event. The distribution of this cetacean species is largely restricted to warm temperate and tropical waters [ 63 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0170184.g001  Fig 1   Geographical sampling of the digenean Pholeter gastrophilus .

Molecular analyses: DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing  All collected worms were used for molecular analysis. Prior to DNA extraction, ethanol in the samples was replaced by 500μl of TE buffer (0.001 M TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 0.001 M EDTA, pH 8). Genomic DNA was extracted from individual worms using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Germany), following the manufacturer’s recommendations, except for the incubation period, which was extended overnight. We amplified the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2 rDNA) using primers 3S [ 64 ] and ITS2.2 [ 65 ]. In addition, the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (mtCOI) was amplified using primers JB3 [ 66 ] and JB4.5 [ 67 ] and the mitochondrial DNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (mtND1) using primers JB11 [ 66 ] and NDJ2a [ 68 ]. The thermocycling profile for the ITS2 rDNA amplification was as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, 40 cycles at 94°C for 50 s, 56°C for 50 s and 72°C for 1 min 20 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 4 min. The profile for the mtCOI amplification was denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, 40 cycles at 92°C for 30 s, 45.6°C for 45 s and 72°C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The profile for mtND1 amplification was denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 20 s and 72°C for 45 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 4 min. Amplicons were purified with GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purifying Kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK) and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems ABI 3730 XL automated sequencer by Macrogen Inc. Europe (The Netherlands). Sequencing was done in both directions using PCR primers. Contigs were assembled using BioEdit 7.0.5.3 and sequence identity was checked using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).    Phylogenetic analyses  The first dataset used in this study included 68 sequences of the ITS2 rDNA of P . gastrophilus , and sequences from Pygidiopsis genata and Ascocotyle longa (Heterophyidae), which were downloaded from GenBank (accession numbers AY245710 and AY245703, respectively) and used as outgroups. Outgroups were selected according to previous phylogenetic studies for the family Heterophyidae [ 17 ]. Sequences were aligned using the online version of MAFFT, available at http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/ . Complete alignment was analysed and uncorrected pairwise p distance matrices were obtained using MEGA 6 [ 69 ].  An additional dataset included 68 concatenated sequences of each corresponding mtND1 and mtCOI sequence from each worm, and sequences of Metagonimus yokogawai (Heterophyidae) and Opisthorchis felineus (Opisthorchiidae), which were downloaded from GenBank (accession numbers NC011127 and NC023249, respectively) and used as outgroups. Prior to concatenation, mitochondrial sequences were aligned independently for each gene using the online version of MAFFT, and were analysed using JModelTest 4.1.2 [ 70 ]. The Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano model with gamma distribution (HKY+G) was selected as the best model that fit both, mtCOI and mtND1 alignments independently. Sequences were concatenated and the complete dataset was run on MEGA 6 [ 69 ] for a ML analysis under the selected model of evolution. Bootstrap values were obtained after 1000 replicates and the heuristic tree searching strategy was Subtree-Pruning-Regrafting (SPR).    Genetic diversity analyses  For population analyses, the 68 sequences of the concatenated regions of the mtND1 and mtCOI of P . gastrophilus were arranged according to the four geographic regions defined previously, i.e., Med, SWA, CEA and NEA ( Fig 1 ). Genetic diversity for the complete dataset (n = 68) and for each population were estimated as the number of unique haplotypes, the number of segregating or polymorphic sites (S), haplotype diversity (Hd) (i.e., the probability that two randomly sampled haplotypes are different), and nucleotide diversity (π) (i.e., the average number of nucleotide differences per site), without considering missing data, as implemented in DNAsp [ 71 ]. A haplotype network using Minimum Spanning Tree was constructed to illustrate the connections between haplotypes using Population Analysis with Reticulate Trees (PopART) available at http://popart.otago.ac.nz [ 72 ].  Pairwise genetic distances for the aligned mitochondrial dataset were calculated with PAUP* [ 73 ] under the HKY model of evolution. To examine whether genetic differentiation in samples from P . gastrophilus might be influenced by a pattern of isolation by distance, Mantel tests were explored as implemented in the library VEGAN from the public domain statistical software R [ 74 , 75 ]. Genetic distances were calculated as Φ ST between pairs of localities in the Isolation by Distance Web Service, available at http://ibdws.sdsu.edu/~ibdws [ 76 ]. Geographic distances, expressed as nautical miles (nm), were estimated to the nearest port using the online platform http://ports.com . An effect of isolation by distance would be indicated, prima facie, by a positive and significant correlation between geographic and genetic distances. However, the Mantel test cannot differentiate patterns resulting from geographical clustering, from those generated by isolation by distance where there is equal migration among populations [ 77 , 78 ]. Therefore, a partial Mantel test was used to explore whether the correlation between genetic and geographic distances of samples was affected by a spatially structured effect. For the partial Mantel tests a third matrix was included in the correlation with the information on the geographical structuring of localities, i.e., whether pairs of localities were from the same region or not. We are aware of the recent debate on the probability of type I error in partial Mantel tests (see [ 79 ]), thus results were interpreted with caution, and the null hypothesis of isolation by distance was rejected only if p was < 0.001 [ 80 , 78 ]. In the partial Mantel test we permuted localities within regions [ 77 ], thus samples from SWA were excluded from the analysis because all samples were collected from a single locality. A graphical representation of the pattern of isolation by distance was made using the Isolation by Distance Web Service [ 76 ].    Population structure analyses  The partitioning of genetic variation within sequences of P . gastrophilus was investigated with an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) [ 81 ]. AMOVA estimates the genetic variance at different levels of a hierarchical division of the population and test the null hypothesis of no genetic structure between regions using a permutational approach [ 81 ]. The power for detection of genetic structure between regions decreases with fewer samples per locality in the population [ 82 ]. Following Fitzpatrick’s [ 82 ] approach, we estimated the number of possible permutations and the minimum p value according to the region structure designed for P . gastrophilus , i.e., one locality for SWA, two localities for Med, three localities for CEA, and three localities for NEA (see Fig 1 ). The genetic structure in P . gastrophilus was partitioned into variation from all samples considering the nine localities (“within the population” Φ ST estimate), the variation among four regions, i.e., SWA, NEA, Med and CEA (“among regions” Φ CT estimate) and the variation among localities within regions (“among localities, within regions” Φ SC estimate). To assess “among regions” variation, three alternative scenarios were considered according to geographic proximity and the need of generating an acceptable number of possible permutations. First, we examined the relative importance of isolation by distance with two scenarios, (1) samples from the Celtic Sea were grouped with CEA (i.e., the AMOVA included one locality for SWA, two localities for Med, four localities for CEA and two localities for NEA); (2) samples from SWA were grouped with CEA (i.e., four localities for SWA+CEA, two localities for Med and three localities for NEA). Second, we assessed the relative importance of land barriers by grouping samples from the Strait of Gibraltar with Med (i.e., one locality for SWA, three localities for Med, two localities for CEA and three localities for NEA). P values associated with the fixation indices were evaluated through 2520 and 1260 random permutations for a four-grouped and a three-grouped structure, respectively, as implemented in Arlequin v. 3.5. [ 83 ].    Demographic history analyses  Tajima’s D and Fu’s tests were used to assess whether sequences of P . gastrophilus departed from the assumption of neutrality [ 84 , 85 ]. Positive or negative values of Tajima’s D and Fu’s would imply the operation of non-neutral processes (e.g., balancing selection or selective sweep, respectively), whereas significant values would be consistent with population expansion [ 84 ]. Tajima’s D and Fu’s tests and their significance values were calculated with Arlequin v. 3.5, based on 1000 simulated re-sampling replicates [ 83 ]. The significant threshold for Tajima’s D was set at 0.05, and for Fu’s at 0.02 [ 83 , 85 ]. The R2 neutrality test was also used because it seems to be more powerful for detecting population growth with small sample sizes [ 86 , 87 ]. R2 values and its significance, under 10,000 coalescent simulations, were calculated with the Population and Evolutionary Genetics Analysis System (PEGAS), implemented in the software R [ 75 , 88 ].  Growth or decline episodes in a population leave signals in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences between pairs of individuals, which can be analysed through a mismatch distribution [ 89 ]. Unimodal and smooth wave-like distributions suggest recent population expansion, whereas irregular multimodal distributions would occur in stationary or shrinking populations [ 90 ]. Mismatch distribution was computed in Arlequin v.5.3, and the smoothness of the observed distribution was quantified with the Harpending’s Raggedness Index under 10,000 bootstrap replicates.     Results   Phylogenetic analyses  We obtained 68 sequences from the ITS2 rDNA from specimens of P . gastrophilus , which were between 407 base pairs (bp) and 501 bp long. Pairwise distance comparison for the aligned portion of the ITS2 rDNA indicated no genetic variation among specimens of P . gastrophilus across the sampled regions.  The 68 mtND1 sequences of P . gastrophilus were between 407 bp and 504 bp long, whereas the 68 mtCOI sequences were between 341 bp and 441 bp long. The alignment of the concatenated sequences of the mtND1 and the mtCOI was 701 bp long excluding sites with missing data, determined by the length of the shortest available sequence. The ML hypothesis suggests that all worms collected from the four regions corresponded to a single and well-supported lineage (ML bootstrap = 100%; Fig 2 ). The intraspecific topology of the ML hypothesis did not support reciprocally monophyletic groups of samples. No internal node received bootstrap support ≥ 71%, although some clades received support ≥ 59%, including samples for NEA (59%) and SWA (64%). An additional clade was also found, grouping five and one sequences from Med and CEA, respectively (ML bootstrap = 61%) ( Fig 2 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170184.g002  Fig 2   Maximum Likelihood analysis.  Analysis for the phylogenetic relationships inferred from the mtND1 and mtCOI sequences of 68 individuals of the digenean Pholeter gastrophilus , collected from seven host species and four geographical regions. Support values for each node were calculated as ML bootstrap after 1000 replicates. Sequences are labelled according to their sampling localities as follows: central eastern Atlantic, CEA (Canary Islands, CI; Galicia North-West Spain, Gal; Strait of Gibraltar, SoG); Mediterranean Sea, Med (Alboran Sea, AS; western Mediterranean, WM); north eastern Atlantic, NEA (Celtic Sea, CS; North Sea, NS); south western Atlantic, SWA.       Genetic diversity analyses  A total of 15 polymorphic sites and 16 different haplotypes were found in the 701 bp-alignment of the concatenated mtND1 and mtCOI sequences ( Table 3 ). The haplotype network showed a relatively simple, star-like topology ( Fig 3 ). Haplotype 4, occurring in Med and CEA, was located centrally. Three haplotypes, namely 1, 3 and 7, stemmed from haplotype 4 and were also shared between Med and CEA. Five haplotypes occurred exclusively in the Med population (haplotypes 2, 5, 6, 8 and 10, see Fig 3 ), where the highest haplotype and nucleotide diversity was observed (Hd = 0.82; π = 0.0021, Table 4 ), followed by the CEA, with three exclusive haplotypes, i.e., 13, 14 and 15 ( Fig 3 ), and Hd = 0.76; π = 0.0016. Three unique haplotypes stemming from the central haplotype were found among individuals of NEA (haplotypes 11, 12 and 16, Fig 3 ; Hd = 0.24; π = 0.0006), whereas a single haplotype was found in individuals from SWA (haplotype 9, Fig 3 ; Hd = 0; π = 0). Single mutational steps established the connection between all haplotypes. The mtND1 showed the highest number of polymorphic sites, representing 14 out of the 16 defined haplotypes, whereas only two haplotypes were found in the mtCOI (data not shown).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170184.g003  Fig 3   Haplotype network.

Genetic pairwise distances for the concatenated mitochondrial sequences (mtND1 and mtCOI) were 0.2% (CEA vs. Med and SWA vs. CEA) and 0.3% (SWA vs. Med, and NEA vs. all localities). The plot for the correlation between genetic and geographic distances is shown in Fig 4 . There was a significant pattern of isolation by distance, suggesting an increase of genetic distances together with geographic distances (Mantel test, r = 0.515; p < 0.001). However, when the spatial structure of localities was considered a non-significant partial Mantel test was obtained (Partial Mantel test, r = 0.438; p = 0.009), suggesting that the geographical clustering of localities, and not the isolation by distance, would account for the pattern observed in samples from the CEA, Med and NEA.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170184.g004  Fig 4   Isolation by distance analysis.  Graphical representation of the isolation by distance analysis among populations of the digenean Pholeter gastrophilus . The relationship between pairwise genetic distance (Φ ST ) and geographical distance (nm) between sampling sites are shown. Triangles represent comparisons of samples from the south western Atlantic (SWA); squares represent comparison of samples with the Mediterranean Sea (Med) and the central eastern Atlantic (CEA); and circles represent comparison of samples with the north eastern Atlantic (NEA).       Population structure analyses  The AMOVA showed significant genetic differentiation in P . gastrophilus at different scales. The highest amount of variation was found within the population, which explained 59.71% of the overall variation (Φ ST = 0.40, p < 0.001, Table 5 ). A significant “among regions” variation (Φ CT = 0.37, p = 0.005) was also found, which accounted for 37.1% of the overall variation. However, only 3.2% of the overall variation was explained by “among localities, within regions” variation (Φ SC = 0.05, p = 0.129) ( Table 5 ). In an alternative arrangement, we grouped samples of the Celtic Sea with those from CEA, and “among localities, within regions” variation increased to 10.3%, and the “among regions” variation decreased to 29.1%. A similar pattern was observed when sequences of SWA were grouped with CEA. In this case, the “among localities, within regions” variation increased to 11.1% and the “among regions” variation decreased to 28.7%. When sequences from the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG) were grouped with Med, the “among localities, within regions” variation remained low (2.3%) and the “among regions” variation still accounts for a sustainable percentage of the overall variation (41.3%) ( Table 5 ). Overall, these results suggest that the genetic variation in the population of P . gastrophilus is mainly accounted for by samples from NEA and SWA.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170184.t005  Table 5  Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) of sequences of mtND1 and mtCOI from 68 individuals of the digenean Pholeter gastrophilus .              1) Geographical regions    Med (AS + WM); SWA (Arg); CEA (Gal + SoG + CI); NEA (CS + NS)    Source of variation  d.f.

Demographic history analyses  Values from both Tajima’s D (-1.45, p = 0.042) and Fu’s (-9.22, p < 0.001) tests were negative and statistically significant. The R2 was low and significant (R2 = 0.049, p = 0.031). Overall, these results suggest that sequences from P . gastrophilus have a bias towards few segregating sites and few haplotypes compared to what would be expected from the neutral theory, supporting a population expansion of P . gastrophilus . Although a significant Harpending’s Raggedness Index ( p < 0.001) for the mismatch distribution would reject the null hypothesis of population expansion, our results showed a clearly unimodal distribution ( Fig 5 ) which, along with the star-like haplotype network, the low value of Harpending’s Raggedness Index (r = 0.08) and the results from the neutrality tests, agree with a population expansion model. In addition, the pattern of distribution and the small value of τ (τ = 1.7) indicate that the population expansion was recent and started from a small population (θ = 0).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170184.g005  Fig 5   Mismatch distribution.

The time of expansion in units of mutational time (τ) and the Harpending’s Raggedness Index (r) are shown.        Discussion  Our results support the hypothesis that all populations of P . gastrophilus surveyed in this study represent a single species. No variation was found in the ITS2 rDNA sequences from all samples, and a maximum genetic difference of just 0.3% was detected in the mtND1 and mtCOI between worms from the two most distant regions (SWA vs. NEA). Previous studies have suggested that the maximum intraspecific variation in digeneans to recognise separate species would be ~1% for ITS2 rDNA [ 91 ] and ~5% for mtDNA [ 92 ], well above the observed values for P . gastrophilus . The use of this “genetic yardstick” has been criticised (see, e.g., [ 93 ]), and reciprocal monophyly has been considered as a suitable alternative method for species delimitation [ 93 – 95 ]. In our study, the absence of reciprocal monophyly confirms that P . gastrophilus is a single lineage, with no deep genetic differentiation associated to specific geographical and/or ecological factors. In any event, sample sizes of P . gastrophilus are modest in some localities and, therefore, more sequences from the South Atlantic, and new samples from the Pacific Ocean, would provide additional support for the hypothesis of a single species.  As noted above, the free-living stages of digeneans have low dispersal ability, thus genetic exchange between their populations must rely on the vagility of their hosts [ 2 , 4 ]. Since the identity of the intermediate hosts of P . gastrophilus is unknown [ 96 ], we use data from other heterophyids to draw inferences on the role of these hosts in the dispersal of P . gastrophilus . All known first intermediate hosts of heterophyids belong to three superfamilies of bottom-dwelling snails, i.e., Cerithioidea, Rissooidea and, more rarely, Littorinoidea [ 97 , 98 ]. Given that digeneans exhibit strong phylogenetic conservatism in the use of first intermediate hosts [ 18 ], it is likely that the life cycle of P . gastrophilus also includes some of these benthic gastropods, although their specific identity may likely vary depending on the geographical region. For instance, the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica , always use lymnaeid snails as first intermediate hosts, but the particular species differs, e.g., between Europe and Australia [ 18 ]. Interestingly, P . gastrophilus infects both coastal and oceanic cetaceans ( Table 1 ), suggesting that its first intermediate host could have a broad bathymetric range; in fact, several cerithioid and rissooid snails do [ 99 ]. This scenario is not unusual in marine digeneans; for instance, Brachyphallus crenatus infects a benthic gastropod that reaches depths up to 500 m [ 99 , 100 ], and also includes a wide array of neritic and oceanic teleosts as definitive hosts [ 97 ]. On the other hand, the second intermediate hosts of heterophyids are generally fish, which become infected through skin penetration of free-swimming cercariae [ 18 ]. In agreement with this observation, all cetaceans in which P . gastrophilus has been reported are at least partially piscivorous [ 101 ], but it is unclear how many fish species could function as second intermediate hosts. In any event, we would hardly expect that fish, or other cetacean prey, could act as paratenic hosts for P . gastrophilus since paratenicity is exceptional in digeneans, and has never been described in heterophyids [ 1 ].  According to the above discussion, the genetic cohesion found among populations of P . gastrophilus would mostly rely on the extensive exploitation of wide-ranging and highly mobile cetaceans. The ability of pelagic cetaceans to move over long distances has been documented for several species that serve as hosts for P . gastrophilus , including, e.g., the short-beaked common dolphin [ 8 , 102 ], the oceanic populations of the bottlenose dolphin [ 103 , 104 ], the dusky dolphin [ 105 ], the short-finned pilot whale [ 106 , 107 ], and the sperm whale [ 108 ] ( Table 1 ). However, we detected significant population structure in the Atlantic population of P . gastrophilus , which was mainly accounted for samples from the two most distant regions, i.e., SWA and NEA. Sequences of worms from SWA shared a unique haplotype and formed a single, though low supported, clade in the ML cladogram. The small sample size precluded the possibility of exploring whether this difference was linked to the existence of geographical or ecological barriers or simply resulted from isolation by distance. Interestingly, though, in the southern Atlantic P . gastrophilus occurs in Argentinean waters but is virtually absent in Brazil ( S1 Fig ). This patchy distribution may perhaps indicate that the life cycle cannot be completed in low latitudes, and so the genetic connectivity between North and South Atlantic populations of P . gastrophilus would depend on trans-equatorial movements of cetaceans [ 109 , 110 ]. Although there are records of tracked individuals that have undergone long-distance migrations (e.g. Risso’s dolphin [ 111 ], bottlenose dolphin [ 112 ], or striped dolphin [ 39 ]), the Equator possibly acts as a significant geographical barrier for cetacean movements, possibly limiting gene flow between northern and southern populations of P . gastrophilus .  A single clade and three unique haplotypes were detected for specimens from NEA, and the AMOVA indicated that the genetic structure in P . gastrophilus might partly be attributed to differences between the NEA and all other regions. Also, results from the partial Mantel test indicated that these differences could primarily result from the existence of geographical and/or ecological barriers isolating NEA samples. A certain degree of isolation of P . gastrophilus in this area could partly be accounted for by the ecological distribution of its cetacean hosts. Out of the 23 samples collected from the NEA, 21 were from a largely sedentary, coastal cetacean, i.e., the harbour porpoise [ 12 ], and other records of P . gastrophilus in the NEA are mostly from coastal cetaceans as well ( S2 Table ). Further ecological factors could reinforce isolation of the NEA populations of P . gastrophilus . In particular, the southern Bay of Biscay functions as a transition zone between the boreal and the subtropical regions, generating an oceanographic boundary for movements of marine organisms [ 113 ], including some cetaceans [ 12 , 114 , 115 ]. It is also worth noting that P . gastrophilus has never been reported in typical boreal cetaceans (including harbour porpoises) from the Atlantic Iberian coast ( S1 Fig ). This gap in the distribution of P . gastrophilus could also hamper genetic mixing through stepping-stone processes [ 5 ] between northern and southern populations in the NE Atlantic.  Rather unexpectedly, we found little genetic differentiation between samples of P . gastrophilus from Med and CE Atlantic. The Strait of Gibraltar generates, not only a physical barrier separating the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, but also a thermal front (the Almeria-Orán Front) situated ca. 350 km eastward from the Strait [ 116 ]). Both factors, particularly the Front, are known to limit gene flow in some fish and mollusc species [ 117 , 118 ]. In addition, there is evidence of genetic distinctiveness of western Mediterranean populations of at least two cetacean species that serve as hosts for P . gastrophilus , namely, the striped dolphin and the bottlenose dolphin [ 11 , 13 , 119 ]. At least in the latter, it is believed that the Almeria-Orán Front contributes to isolation because the dolphin populations are locally adapted to feed on specific prey from each side of the Front [ 13 ]. We hypothesize that the genetic connectivity of P . gastrophilus across the Strait of Gibraltar would depend on regular in-and-out movements of some cetaceans, or perhaps fish intermediate hosts, that are not affected by oceanographic barriers. For instance, populations of the common dolphin, a typical host for P . gastrophilus , exhibit ample gene flow between the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, apparently because they chase pelagic prey that are highly vagile [ 8 ].  The neutrality tests rendered negative and significant values, suggesting that the population of P . gastrophilus has suffered either an expansion or an evolutionary event that removed variation in the population (e.g., selective sweeps or bottleneck events) [ 84 ]. Note that Fu’s and R2 tests are more powerful than Tajima’s [ 87 ], particularly when sample size is small [ 86 ]. This pattern is compatible with the hypothesis that P . gastrophilus suffered a population bottleneck in the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the observed demographic structure could reflect the origin and subsequent spreading of P . gastrophilus in cetaceans, at least in the Atlantic Ocean. It has been hypothesized that the ancestor of P . gastrophilus colonised cetaceans from marine birds via trophic guilds [ 17 ]. Since colonization via host switching should start from a small population, the population of P . gastrophilus would have had undergone an expansion by exploiting different cetacean species. This hypothesis, however, would imply that the origin of the association between P . gastrophilus and cetaceans occurred in the Atlantic, its occurrence in the Pacific basin being more recent ( Table 1 , S1 Fig ). This hypothesis should be tested in the future by including samples from the entire geographic range of P . gastrophilus , and based on molecular data from more than one locus using a coalescent framework (see [ 120 ] for a review).  In summary, results from this study indicate that there is ample genetic connectivity among populations of P . gastrophilus , but also significant genetic structure at regional scale. Both features would depend on (1) the dispersal patterns of the most mobile (definitive) host, which are in part influenced by oceanographic barriers, and (2) perhaps the patchy distribution of potential intermediate hosts at a global scale. There is positive evidence of this connectivity for some parasites infecting marine birds [ 5 ], but there are many unexplored host-parasite systems that deserve a closer look, especially those involving large pelagic vertebrates such as elasmobranchs or marine turtles. A broader implication of our study is that the mobility of definitive hosts might be a major factor shaping the genetic structure of other trophically-transmitted, generalist marine parasites that are geographically widespread.

Background  Several common genetic variants have been associated with either ventricular fibrillation (VF) or sudden cardiac death (SCD). However, replication efforts have been limited. Therefore, we aimed to analyze whether such variants may contribute to VF caused by first ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).    Methods  We analyzed 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) previously associated with SCD/VF in other cohorts, and examined whether these SNPs were associated with VF caused by first STEMI in the GEnetic causes of Ventricular Arrhythmias in patients with first ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (GEVAMI) study on ethnical Danes. The GEVAMI study is a prospective case-control study involving 257 cases (STEMI with VF) and 537 controls (STEMI without VF).    Results  Of the 27 candidate SNPs, one SNP (rs11720524) located in intron 1 of SCN5A which was previously associated with SCD was significantly associated with VF caused by first STEMI. The major C-allele of rs11720524 was present in 64% of the cases and the C/C genotype was significantly associated with VF with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.87 (95% CI: 1.12–3.12; P = 0.017). After controlling for clinical differences between cases and controls such as age, sex, family history of sudden death, alcohol consumption, previous atrial fibrillation, statin use, angina, culprit artery, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, the C/C genotype of rs11720524 was still significantly associated with VF with an OR of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.05–3.43; P = 0.032). Marginal associations with VF were also found for rs9388451 in HEY2 gene. The CC genotype showed an insignificant risk for VF with OR = 1.50 (95% CI: 0.96–2.40; P = 0.070).    Conclusion  One common intronic variant in SCN5A suggested an association with VF caused by first STEMI. Further studies into the functional abnormalities associated with the noncoding variant in SCN5A may lead to important insights into predisposition to VF during STEMI.

Data Availability  All relevant data are within the paper.    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0170193.t003   Introduction  Coronary artery disease and its ultimate consequence, myocardial infarction (MI), are believed to underlie 75% of the deaths of patients who experience sudden cardiac death (SCD).[ 1 – 3 ] It is also estimated that SCD accounts for 30 to 50% of all coronary deaths.[ 4 ] SCD is a major challenge for the clinician because most episodes occur in individuals without previously identified cardiac disease.[ 5 , 6 ] The pathophysiology of SCD caused by MI is complex. It is believed to involve an interaction between underlying disease and a transient event, such as acute myocardial ischemia, which results in electrical instability and ventricular fibrillation (VF).[ 2 ] VF is a life-threatening complication and occurs in nearly 12% of patients with first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).[ 7 , 8 ] Therefore, efforts to improve risk stratification for SCD should in part be based on an understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying the occurrence of VF.[ 9 ] In the GE netic causes of V entricular A rrhythmias in patients with first ST-elevation M yocardial I nfarction (GEVAMI) study on ethnical Danes[ 7 ] and the Dutch AGNES ( A rrhythmia G enetics in the NE therlandS S tudy) study[ 10 ] both suggested a possible genetic component to VF since patients with a family history of sudden death among first-degree relatives had significantly higher odds of experiencing VF before primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). In the AGNES study, a common genetic variant at 21q21 (rs2824292, odds ratio (OR) = 1.78, 95% CI 1.47–2.13, P = 3.3x10 -10 ) was found to be associated with VF before PPCI in STEMI patients in a genome-wide association study (GWAS).[ 11 ] The rs2824292 is located upstream of CXADR gene which encodes the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a transmembrane cell adhesion molecule predominantly located at the intercalated disc between cardiomyocytes.[ 12 ] However, this association has yet to be replicated in a larger cohort. There have also been several other variants reported to be associated with SCD, primarily from candidate gene studies with limited replication.[ 9 ] Therefore, we aimed to determine whether the 21q21variant, as well as other variants previously associated with SCD, would be associated with underlying susceptibility to VF due to first STEMI in the GEVAMI case-control study.    Methods   Study population  The GEVAMI study is an ongoing nationwide prospective Danish case-control study among patients with first STEMI between the ages of 18 and 80 years.[ 7 ] Cases are patients who experienced onset of VF within the first 12 hours of symptoms of STEMI before guided catheter insertion for PPCI, and controls did not have VF during this time period or during PPCI. Cases and controls are collected at all four PCI centers in Denmark. Cases and controls were required to have cardiac symptoms lasting ≤12 hours, acute STEMI on ECG, and a plan to proceed with for acute PPCI. Baseline demographics and previous medical history are collected by research coordinators utilizing pre-designed questionnaires and whole blood is collected for genetic analysis. Follow-up on the patients is done by the Danish registries.    Ethics statement  Signed informed consent is available for all patients enrolled in this study. Procedures are in accordance with the ethical standards of the national ethics committee (protocol number: H-3-2010-133) on human research and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983. Permission from the Danish Data Protection Agency was also obtained before the study was initiated (Jr.nr. 2010-41-5688). The study was conducted according to the guidelines of The National Committee on Health Research Ethics, Denmark.    DNA extraction and SNP genotyping  In brief, total genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples using LGC’s Kleargene ™ silica-based DNA extraction, performed at LGC Genomics. Isolated DNA was analyzed using UV spectrophotometry to estimate both the quality and quantity of the DNA and normalized.  Based upon the results of previous genetic association studies, 27 common genetic variants known to associate with VF/SCD[ 2 , 9 , 11 , 13 – 16 , 16 – 25 ] were selected for SNP genotyping in the cases and controls. SNP genotyping was performed using KASP ™ genotyping assays from LGC genomics ( http://www.lgcgenomics.com ). For each putative varietal SNP, two allele-specific forward primers and one common reverse primer were designed (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, UK). KASP genotyping assays are based on competitive allele-specific PCR and enable biallelic scoring of SNPs at specific loci. The SNP-specific KASP Assay mix and the universal KASP Master mix are added to DNA samples, a thermal cycling reaction is then performed, followed by an end-point fluorescent read. Bi-allelic discrimination is achieved through the competitive binding of two allele-specific forward primers, each with a unique tail sequence that corresponds with two universal FRET (fluorescence resonant energy transfer) cassettes; one labelled with FAM ™ dye and the other with HEX ™ dye. All assays were conducted without knowledge of case status, and samples were labeled by study code only. Genotypes for all SNPs passed our quality-control threshold (call-rate ≥94%; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P>0.05 in control subjects).    Statistical analysis  Medians or proportions of baseline and presenting characteristics in Table 1 were computed for cases and controls, and significance of associations were tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and the χ2 test or Fisher exact test (where appropriate) for categorical variables. A two-tailed p value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. An age and sex-adjusted logistic regression model were constructed to estimate OR for the association between each SNP and VF using an additive model of inheritance. Any SNPs which were significantly associated with VF were also adjusted for clinical differences between cases and controls such as family history of sudden death, alcohol consumption, previous atrial fibrillation, statin use, angina, culprit artery, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow.[ 7 ] We considered each SNP as a single hypothesis however a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was used to assess the association of single SNP with VF. Homozygote risk allele and adjusted odds ratios are presented in Table 2 . Per copy risk allele frequency is provided in Table 3 . All analyses were performed using the Stata software package version 12.0 (StataCorp).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170193.t001  Table 1  Baseline characteristics of the cohort.

Results   Clinical characteristics of the cohort  A total of 257 cases (35 women and 222 men) with VF caused by STEMI and 537 (131 women and 426 men) STEMI controls without VF were included in this prospective study. The clinical characteristics at the time of STEMI are shown in Table 1 . The median age of the cases was 60 (interquartile range (IQR); 53–68) years and for the controls 61 (IQR; 52–66) years. Compared to the control group, the case group was more likely to be male, have a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) or hypercholesterolemia, and a family history of sudden death as reported previously.[ 7 ] Furthermore, the proportion on statin therapy was higher in the case group compared to the control group, likely due to the higher degree of hypercholesterolemia in the case group ( Table 1 ). Median levels of average weekly alcohol intake were higher in the case group (6 units/week) as compared to the control group (3 units/week) without VF (P = 0.001). Cases did not differ significantly from the controls with respect to other cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, and hypertension.    Genotyping  A panel of 27 SNPs was genotyped in 794 individuals ( Table 2 ). The overall call rate was ≥94%. Homozygote risk allele and the results of the case-control association are presented in Table 2 . The strongest association was observed for the rs11720524 SNP which is located in intron 1 of SCN5A near the promoter region. The homozygous C/C genotype of rs11720524 was associated with VF with an OR of 1.87 (95% CI: 1.12–3.12; P = 0.017) ( Table 3 ). After controlling for clinical differences between cases and controls such as age, sex, family history of sudden death, alcohol consumption, previous atrial fibrillation, statin use, angina, culprit artery, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, the C/C genotype of rs11720524 was still significantly associated with VF with an OR of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.05–3.43; P = 0.032) (not shown in the table). Even though we tested each SNP as a single hypothesis, the rs11720524 SNP was not associated with VF after Bonferroni correction.  The risk allele frequencies for each SNP and the results from logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and sex under additive genetic model of inheritance (per copy allele frequency) are presented in Table 3 . Each increasing copy of the major C-allele (per allele risk) of rs11720524 was borderline associated with VF with an OR of 1.25 (95% CI: 0.99–1.57; P = 0.050) ( Table 3 ). The call rate for the rs11720524 SNP was 94.2%.  Furthermore, the rs9388451 SNP which is a non-coding SNP and is near the HEY2 gene showed trend for association with VF. Each increasing copy of the risk allele C-allele (per allele risk) of rs9388451 was borderline associated with VF with an OR of 1.20 (95% CI: 0.97–1.50; P = 0.090) ( Table 2 ) and the homozygous CC genotype showed an insignificant increase risk for VF with OR = 1.50 (95% CI: 0.96–2.40; P = 0.070) ( Table 3 ).  The common genetic variant at 21q21 (rs2824292) previously associated with VF before PPCI in STEMI patients in the AGNES study[ 11 ] was not replicated in the present GEVAMI study (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.75–1.18; P = 0.600) ( Table 2 ).  For two SNPs (rs4665058 and rs6795970), a homozygote risk allele (A/A and G/G, respectively) did not exists in our cohort although the average call-rate was 97.8% for the two SNPs. We were not able to genotype the SNP rs7737692 even after 3 times replication. No other SNPs were associated with VF (Tables 2 and 3 ).     Discussion  In this prospective case-control study in Denmark we identified a common variant (rs11720524) located in intron 1 of the SCN5A gene near the promoter region which was associated with VF in patients with STEMI. To our knowledge, this is the first study linking a common variant in SCN5A , the major sodium ion channel in the heart, to VF caused by first STEMI. Genetic studies have been successful in uncovering rare mutations in ion channel genes and these have been associated with rare Mendelian arrhythmic disorders, most notably the long-QT syndrome and to a lesser degree Brugada syndrome,[ 9 , 26 ] and for some of these disorders genetic testing has become a pivotal part of clinical care.[ 27 , 28 ] In contrast, studies aimed at identifying genetic risk factors for VF in the setting of MI affecting the majority and older segment of the population have been sparse[ 11 ] and therefore genetic architecture of this complex and multi-factorial disease largely remains unknown.  The major C allele of rs11720524 has previously been shown associated to SCD in a combined nested case-control analysis among 516 cases and 1522 matched control subjects of European ancestry enrolled in 6 prospective cohort studies.[ 14 ] Although the associations between the SNP (rs11720524) and sudden/arrhythmic death were relatively consistent across the 6 studies, nevertheless this finding required an independent replication study as it was done in our case-control setup which has a comparable size and is well-phenotyped (VF), which is necessary to establish certainty regarding the observed association. To support the association of rs11720524 with VF in our study a recent study also showed an association of the C/C genotype of the rs11720524 with SCD (OR = 1.351; p = 0.019).[ 29 ] Although this association was shown in a highly heterogeneous cardiac death cohort further subgroup analysis also showed an association of the C/C genotype of the rs11720524 with SCD in chronic ischemic heart disease patients (OR = 1.455; p = 0.012). Two other SNPs in SCN5A (rs41312391 and rs11708996) were not associated to VF in the GEVAMI cohort. The SNP rs41312391risk allele (A) which is also located in the intron near SCN5A has been associated with QT-interval prolongation in normal subjects in one study (n = 282, P = 0.04).[ 30 ] and QT-interval shortening in another study (n = 396, P = 0.02).[ 31 ] Furthermore, in the FinSCDgen Study, Lahtinen et al. and coworkers showed an association of the SNP rs41312391 risk allele (A) with SCD with relative risk 1.27 per minor T allele, 95% CI 1.11–1.45, p = 3.4x10 -4 ).[ 25 ] The expression analysis indicated that rs41312391 may change the expression level of a nearby gene, WDR48 , which encodes a WD repeat-containing protein, a regulator of histone deubiquitinating complexes.[ 25 ] However, they concluded that SCN5A remains the more likely candidate gene for SCD due to its known function in cardiac conduction and repolarization. Furthermore, the SNP rs11708996 has been associated with PR interval (which is an intermediate phenotype of atrial fibrillation),[ 32 ] QT interval[ 33 ] and Brugada syndrome.[ 34 ] This finding suggests that the SNP rs11708996 modifying effects are distinct and in the GEVAMI cohort did not predict risk of VF in STEMI patients.  Identifying the exact causal SNP within the haplotype tagged by (rs11720524) to understand the underlying genetic mechanism is important and requires functional studies to further understand the possible role of this gene in the setting of VF. Since SNPs are highly correlated (in linkage) to the neighboring SNPs and thereby forming haplotypes and presumably these intronic variants in this halpotypes may exert their influence through the level of expression of SCN5A . A number of SNPs at the SCN5A and SCN10A locus ( Table 2 ) have been associated with ECG changes such as QT, RR and QRS interval[ 9 ], however our lead SNP (rs11720524) was not in linkage disequilibrium with any one of these.  The rs9388451 SNP is a non-coding SNP and near the HEY2 gene and encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional repressor that is expressed in the cardiovascular system.[ 35 ] Recently, the rs9388451 SNP was shown to be associated with Brugada syndrome and data indicates that HEY2 regulates cardiac electrical activity in Brugada syndrome by altering the transcriptional programming during cardiac development.[ 13 ] Even though the association of the (C/C) rs9388451 was not significant (OR = 1.50; P = 0.070), it showed the same trend and it could be due to lack of power in our analysis.  Several studies[ 7 , 10 , 36 ] such as our Danish GEVAMI study and the Dutch AGNES study, showed an association of family history of sudden death with VF caused by first STEMI suggesting a genetic burden of the disease. The AGNES study reported the first GWAS for STEMI patients with VF before PPCI. In this GWAS study the most significant association with VF was found at 21q21 (rs2824292, OR = 1.78, 95% CI:1.47–2.13; P = 3.3x10 -10 ).[ 11 ] Despite this novel and important finding, the association of SNP rs2824292 was not detected in the GEVAMI study nor in a small German case-control study.[ 7 , 37 ] However, there is no obvious explanation for this disparity. It could be explained by lack of power or maybe the effect of the risk allele may differ between populations because of gene-gene or gene-environment interactions.[ 38 ] Larger sample sizes and homogenous enriched subgroups will be needed to identify and replicate additional genetic variants associated with VF during STEMI. For instance the location of the culprit coronary lesion may modify QRS duration and QTc interval and thereby risk of VF.[ 9 , 39 ] Stratification of VF patients based on culprit lesion may give us a more discrete phenotype, but this requires a very large sample size. An even more discrete phenotype based on the mechanism of VF (whether it is an immediate VF (phase Ia) or delayed (after the first 15 minutes) VF (phase Ib)) may also be warranted.[ 40 ] This hypothesis is supported by experimental data comparing wild-type (WT) and heterozygous CAR deficient (CAR +/− ) mice.[ 39 ] These data suggested that the burden of VF is much higher in CAR +/− mice with acute left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion compared to the WT, and this higher VF burden was only observed within the first 15 minutes of acute occlusion of LAD. During later stages of the ischemic episode, arrhythmia inducibility was not different between WT and CAR +/− mice.[ 39 ]  Lastly, in a combined meta-analysis of GWAS studies of individuals with SCD and control individuals of European ancestry, a locus at chromosome 2q24.2 (rs4665058) was found to be associated with SCD[ 17 ]; however, this SNP was not associated to VF in the AGNES study or in the GEVAMI study. These inconsistencies could be caused by heterogeneous underlying cardiac pathologies of SCD and differing phenotypes (i.e., VF vs. SCD).[ 9 ]  The common SNPs associated with VF in the studies mentioned above all by nature had small effect sizes on risk and are not currently used for clinical management. With the rapid development of next - generation sequencing technologies, large-scale sequencing projects are becoming possible allowing the examination of rare genetic variants with larger effects which could be useful for risk stratification.  We considered each SNP as a single hypothesis but a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing is often applied in genetic association studies but might be too conservative for highly selective candidate SNP-based approaches. However, we need to acknowledge that none of the SNPs would be significant if Bonferroni corrected for multiple testing (P = 0.0019[0.05/27]). Furthermore, the sample size of 257 VF cases is still fairly low and limits the ability of this study to find association of common variants with modest effect. It is also important to mention that collecting cases is very time consuming and limited due to relatively low incidence of VF and difficulties to enroll and collect blood samples in STEMI-patients with VF and cardiac arrest. This is mostly due to that patients who died outside of the hospital or died in-hospital prior to enrollment cannot be included. Most of the 27 SNPs reported to be associated with SCD/VF were identified in patients without acute coronary syndrome, hence may reflect the underlying pathophysiology of SCD/VF in a more general population rather patients with VF due to first STEMI.  Finally, our results in this population with white, European/Danish ancestry may not be generalizable to other populations.  The present study nicely shows that it is often difficult to replicate the genetic associations observed in previous studies in some other populations. The genetic factors involved in this complex and multi-factorial disease are still largely unknown; therefore the current study on all the previous SNPs associated with SCD/VF is important, especially for future direction of functional studies for more clarification of arrhythmia mechanism and targeted intervention strategies.

Background  The recent crisis of refugees seeking asylum in European countries challenges public health on many levels. Most refugees currently arrive from Syria, Afghanistan, or Eritrea. Data about multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR) prevalence are not present for these countries. However, when entering the European heath care systems, data about colonisation rates regarding highly resistant bacterial pathogens are important.    Methods  We performed a cross-sectional screening in four Swiss refugee centres to determine the colonization rates for MRSA and ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae . We used pharyngeal, nasal, and inguinal swabs for MRSA and rectal swabs and urine for ESBL and carbapenemase screening using standard microbiological procedures. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to determine the relatedness of MRSA isolates with high resolution due to a suspected outbreak.    Results  41/261(15.7%) refugees were colonized with MRSA. No differences regarding the country of origin were observed. However, in a single centre significantly more were colonized, which was confirmed to be a recent local outbreak. 57/241 (23.7%) refugees were colonized with ESBL with significantly higher colonisation in persons originating from the Middle East (35.1%, p<0.001). No carbapenemase producers were detected.    Conclusion  The colonisation rate of the refugees was about 10 times higher for MRSA and 2–5 times higher for ESBL compared to the Swiss population. Contact precaution is warranted for these persons if they enter medical care. In cases of infections, MRSA and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae should be considered regarding antibiotic treatment choices.

Data Availability  All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0170251.g002   Introduction  As poverty, violent conflicts, or persecution of minorities remain important problems throughout the world, migration to countries with stable political situation or higher income will hardly diminish. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), about 42’500 persons are forced to leave their homes every day due to conflict and persecutions [ 1 ]. While the majority of the worldwide 60 million refugees are displaced within the country of origin or distributed in neighbouring countries, developed countries provide asylum to 25% of the global total [ 1 ].  Although the data on prevalence of highly resistant bacteria in the origin countries of the refugees is not known, a worldwide increase of antibiotic resistance is documented [ 2 ]. Important gaps in surveillance exist and therefore, the colonization status with multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria of asylum seekers coming to developed countries remains largely unknown. The travel conditions promote the possibility of transmission from one person to another e.g. by overloaded boats without sanitary facilities, crowded refugee camps with poor hygiene conditions, and passage through countries with high rates of MDR bacteria such as Greece and Italy [ 3 – 5 ]. Screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive Enterobacteriaceae in refugees is controversially discussed as screening is not feasible for all refugees and the costs are high [ 6 ].  Many refugees seek medical attention in Western countries. Colonisation or infection with MDR bacteria may impact the therapeutic and infection control management. In addition, MDR bacteria possess a potential public health threat. In the current situation, more detailed data is certainly needed. In Switzerland, refugee centres are rather small (40 to 150 persons) and widely spread over the country. Once in Switzerland, refugees will be placed in one of the seven national arrival centres, where a nurse performs the initial health assessment without further detailed clinical, radiological, or laboratory investigations. Refugees stay in the arrival centres for one to three weeks and are then transferred in smaller cantonal centres. These centres often have collaborations with a physician practitioner or local hospital, but no centralized and standardized “migrant health” care is provided. The rapid transfer from primary to follow-up centres often causes difficulties in transferring previously collected medical information and thus causes an important gap especially in the context of transmittable infectious diseases such as MDR bacteria. Due to this unclear situation, some hospitals use contact precautions and procedures for patients from a refugee centre.  We assessed the cross-sectional rates of colonization of MRSA and ESBL as well as carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae in four cantonal refugee centres in North-western Switzerland. We explored weather the colonization rate is linked to the refugee`s region of origin and other risk factors, such as superficial wounds. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to assess the relatedness of isolates and provided evidence for a suspected MRSA-transmission event in one refugee centre. In addition, we determined the rate of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive MRSA strains from WGS data, as this toxin is a major virulence factor for pathogen transmission and more severe clinical infections [ 7 ].    Patients and Methods   Study design  Information about the study was performed in two steps. The staffs of the refugee centres were asked to participate in this observational study and detailed written information regarding the study design was provided. The staff of the local centre gave primary information to the residents. Those willing to participate were invited for a second, individual information about the details and procedure of the study given by the investigators in oral form during the site visit. Due to illiteracy, written informed consent was not feasible. Refugees who declined to participate were taken off the list provided by the centre staff. It was noted that the participants accepted the different swabs taken. Some accepted nasopharygeal but declined groin and/or rectal swabs. This was noted for each participant. Persons younger than 15 years were excluded from the study. If requested by the parents, we performed a clinical check and treated if for example scabies was present. However, no swabs were taken from these children. Persons 15 to 18 years were included, but all of them were young males that had travelled by themselves to Switzerland. This procedure was approved by the local ethic committee (EKNZ 2016–00005) and by the office of public health of the canton Solothurn ( S1 File . approval ethic committee.pdf).  261 refugees participated in the study. The total number of refugees changed daily, but about 330 refugees were housed in the four centres. Participants were asked about skin problems, and if present, clinical evaluation was performed. For specific skin disease treatment was offered. In respect to travel time, some persons had spent years in another country before entering Switzerland, so we calculated travel time for these persons separately.    Inclusion and exclusion criteria  20 participants declined groin or rectal swab sampling. They were excluded from the ESBL and carbapenemase- but still included in the MRSA screening.  Children younger than 15 years were not included, but were offered a clinical check if skin problems were present.    Microbiological assessment  For detection of MRSA, swabs from throat, nostrils and groins were used. Swabs were cultured in Staphylococcus enrichment broth (AxonLab, Switzerland) and the following day subcultured on Columbia CNA with 5% sheep blood and ChromID ™ MRSA smart (all bioMérieux, Geneva, Switzerland). Presumptive MRSA was confirmed by agglutination with Pastorex StaphPlus (BioRad, Switzerland) and Slidex ® MRSA (bioMérieux), respectively.  For detection of Enterobacteriaceae producing ESBL or carbapenemases, rectal swab and urine sampling was performed. Swabs and urine were directly cultured on MacConkey agar, ChromID ™ ESBL, and ChromID ™ Carba smart (all bioMérieux). Presumptive Enterobacteriaceae with ESBL production were identified by VitekMS (bioMérieux) and confirmed by double-disk synergy test (DDST) with cefepime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and by the combination disk test (CDT) with cefotaxime/ceftazidime +/- clavulanic acid (Becton Dickinson, Basle, Switzerland) according to EUCAST guidelines for detection of resistance mechanisms and specific resistances of clinical and/or epidemiological importance (Version 1.0; December 2013; page 14 ff).  For the screening of Enterobacteriaceae producing carbapenemases , all directly cultivated samples did not show any growth on ChromID ™ Carba smart agar after two days of incubation.  Scabies was diagnosed clinically. In unclear situations, improvement after treatment with Ivermectin was estimated as being diagnostic.    Whole genome sequencing  Due to a potential outbreak with MRSA, whole genome sequencing and analysis of genomic data was carried out as described previously [ 8 ]. Additionally, NGS analysis was carried out using Seqsphere+ (Ridom, Germany), the MRSA cgMLST scheme [ 9 ] and a maximum of 10 allelic differences was defined to be consistent with an transmission event. The data was analysed to determine the relatedness in phylogeny (regarding allelic differences) and to detect the PVL gene as an important virulence factor. All sequencing data is available from the Sequence Read Archive ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra ).    Outbreak definition  In one centre, we saw a marked higher number of MRSA cases than in other centres. We defined an outbreak as significant higher proportion of MDR cases than expected that were geographically localized with evidence of transmission within a centre.    Statistical analysis  Mean and standard deviations are indicated if not otherwise stated. The percentages of refugees screened positive for MRSA, ESBL and carbapenemases, and scabies were correlated with gender, the country of origin, the resident centre, and presence of skin disease. Categorical variables were analysed using a Chi-square test. All p-values are two sided with a 0.05 level of significance. Data was managed and analysed with the SPSS Statistics software (version 22.0; IBM, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) and GraphPad Prism (version 4.0; GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.).     Results   Patient and travel characteristics  A total of 261 persons were screened in four centres. Centre A (47 persons) and centre D (55 persons) hosted single persons as well as families, while centre B (37 persons) and D (122 persons) hosted only men. Centre B and D were civil protection facilities located underground with up to 30 persons in one room. Centre A and C were normal buildings with smaller rooms and a maximum of six beds per room.  Although a total of 24 nationalities were present, most refugees originated from Afghanistan (92/261; 35.2%), Syria (39/261; 14.9%) and Eritrea (52/261; 19.9%). We classified them in five different regions: Middle East (Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Pakistan) East Africa (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan), Central/West Africa (Congo, Nigeria, Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast), Northern Africa (Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco), and Far East (China, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh).  75% of the persons were male, mean age was 26.3 ± 8.3 years.

Mean stay in the centre before screening was 61.8 ± 46.7 days, without a significant difference between the centres (p = 0.20) ( Table 1 ) .

Moreover, 17/261 persons had other non-scabies related skin affections such as wounds from injuries. Having skin affections was a risk factor for colonisation with MRSA (odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.25–5.48, p = 0.01).  For ESBL, the overall rate of colonization was higher than for MRSA. A total of 57/241 (23.6%) were positive. In contrast to MRSA, no particular association with a specific refugee centre could be determined (p = 0.6). However, significantly more persons from Middle East were found to be positive compared to persons from other regions (p <0.001). In a post hoc analysis for ESBL colonisation rates, only the difference between Middle East and East Africa reached statistical significance (Odds ratio 7.02; p<0.001). However, the limited number of participants from the other regions was probably the factor for not reaching statistical significance. All ESBL strains were E coli , and no carbapenemase positive bacterial isolates were identified.    Phylogenetic analysis of MRSA isolates  Due to a potential outbreak in refugee centre D, we performed a whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of 40/42 available MRSA isolates. WGS phylogeny analysis of all MRSA strains is shown in Fig 2 using a neighbour joining tree. Six clusters with potential transmission events could be observed. One large cluster in refugee centre D showed 16 highly related isolates with less than ≤2 allele difference (cluster 1). Close to this cluster, we found a second smaller cluster with three more isolates (cluster 2, ≤3 allele difference). Very likely, these two clusters are connected, which was indicated due to 26 allelic differences between the two clusters ( S1 Fig ). Additionally, we identified three clusters with single transmission events, again less than ≤5 allelic differences apart (cluster 3–5). While isolates not found in those clusters differ by more than 250 alleles.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170251.g002  Fig 2   Phylogeny using whole genome sequencing data of MRSA isolates.  Centres are marked as A-D. Panton valentin leukocidin (PVL) positive isolates are indicates with “+”.     The countries of origin of the refugees within the clusters were scattered over all countries, no regional relatedness or similar travel route within the cluster could be identified. Moreover, the close relatedness (with less than 5 allelic differences) between the isolates of each cluster strongly indicates recent transmission events. One slightly more diverse cluster (cluster 6) showed about between 20 and 50 allelic differences between isolates and this suggests a much earlier transmission event ( Fig 2 and S1 Fig ).  When we accounted each outbreak and transmission event for one (initial) carrier, the estimated prevalence rate of MRSA was (20/261) 7.7%. In this calculation, the isolates of cluster 6 were counted as independent strains, as the diversity within the cluster suggested a transmission months ago.    Virulence factors in MRSA isolates  We focused on the most dominating virulence factor, the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). Interestingly, we found that 26/40 (63%) of the samples were positive. This high rate could be largely explained due to the transmission of PVL-positive strains between the refugees ( Fig 2 )    Antibiotic susceptibilities to non betalactame antibiotics (MRSA)  The susceptibilities were as following: clindamycin 39/39 (100%); erythromycin 38/39 (97.4%); TMP/SMP32/39 (82%); fusidic acid 18/39 (46.2%); tetracycline 10/39 (25.6%); quinolones 36/39 (92.3%), rifampin 39/93 (100%)     Discussion  The colonisation rates of MDR bacteria is influenced by the regions and populations studied. Our study showed a MRSA carriage rate of 15.7%, which seems to be much higher compared to most European countries with rates of around 0.5–2% [ 10 – 12 ]. However, outside of Europe higher rates have been described. The nasal MRSA carriage rate range from 3.6%[ 13 ] (Taiwan janitors workers) to 32% and 25% in outpatients from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, respectively[ 14 ]. In our study, no statistically different MRSA carriage rates between different geographical regions were detected. We identified a larger outbreak in one of the Swiss refugees camps and a series of smaller transmission events. As a consequence, the “true” prevalence rate in the country of origin is not reliably assessable in such a cross-sectional study design. WGS analysis provided a high resolution to address this important caveat. When we accounted each outbreak for one (initial) carrier, the estimated prevalence rate of MRSA was 7.7%. We however think that the situation of refugees in the centres facilitates transmission, and outbreaks could also occur in other centres. The reason why the MRSA rate is much higher in the developing rather than in the western world is poorly understood, and data from origin countries of the refugees are scarce. However, our findings confirm some more recent work. In Ethiopia, the overall MRSA colonisation in health care workers was 12.7%[ 15 ]. In Eritrea, 9% of all S . aureus from healthy hospital staff was found to be resistant to methicillin[ 16 ]. For Syria and Afghanistan, no clear data about prevalence of MRSA exists, but case series with MRSA infections have been described [ 17 , 18 ]. However, the “true” prevalence rate might be over-estimated due to local outbreaks. For physicians treating patients from a refugee centre, local surveillance of refugee centres in regards of MDR bacteria might be very important. In our cross-sectional study, the MRSA colonization rate between refugee centres ranged from 2.4% to 25.4%. The high rate of PVL positive MRSA strains is interesting, and a recent comparison between Eritrean and Non-Eritrean patients with common skin infections found a higher percentage of PVL in MSSA of Eritrean patients as well [ 19 ].  The overall colonization rates of ESBL detected in refugees (23.7%) was much higher compared to recent published data in the Swiss population. In 2013, 5/170 (2.8%) healthy people showed a colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae prior to travelling from Switzerland to South Asia [ 20 ]. In a health care setting, higher numbers have been published. The Swiss antibiotic resistance surveillance program, Anresis, determined that 10.8% of E . coli isolated in 2015 were ESBL-producers [ 20 ]. Other studies from Switzerland and Spain describe similar rates of 5.8% in 2011 and 6.6% in 2006, respectively in the environment (food, animals)[ 21 – 23 ]. We could not determine differences in colonization rates between centres, but actually based on the country of origin. This provides some evidence that there was no local outbreak with ESBL E . coli .  No data is available from Eritrea regarding MDR Enterobacteriaceae . However, publications from Ethiopia and Afghanistan describe high rates of ESBL-producers with 87.4% and 70%, respectively[ 24 , 25 ]. In French military personnel returning from overseas (mainly Afghanistan), ESBL colonisation rate was 13.3%, and thus six times higher than reported in soldiers in suburbs of Paris[ 26 ]. We did not find carbapenemase producing bacteria in our cross-sectional screening. In Ethiopia 5/183 (2.7%) Enterobacteriaceae identified in urinary tract infection showed a Carbapenemase [ 24 ].  Our study has some limitations: Although this is the largest study investigating colonisation rates of MRSA, ESBL, and carbapenemases in refugees, it was limited to four centres of one geographical region of Switzerland. Travel history could not be exactly documented, and only persons newly arrived in Switzerland were included. As the dynamics of refugees arriving in Western countries is rapidly changing, our study provides just a snapshot. Unfortunately, the ESBL isolates were not available for WGS typing, so person to person transmission within a centre cannot definitively ruled out.  In summary, our data suggests, that for all refugees admitted to medical care facilities in Europe, screening and potentially contact isolation should be performed. A similar suggestion was made due to an observation in refugees admitted to a german university hospital with even higher rates of MDR gram negative bacteria in clinical specimen[ 27 ].The higher likelihood of MRSA and ESBL E . coli needs to be considered in the clinical evaluation of infectious diseases and covered by the choice of empirical treatment. A possible solution for faster information on presence of MDR pathogens in a refugee could be a central database for carriage of MDR bacteria or forwarding of the medical history to the subsequent refugee centre to reduce multiple screening. Until now, special focus of health care problems in migrants did not get much attention. Given the special situation, we think that “migrant medicine” has to become an important issue, and as these people often do not reflect epidemiology of classical European patients. Therefore more data, and especially longitudinal studies, are warranted to assess these important aspects impacting on public health.

The presence of large carnivores can affect lower trophic levels by suppressing mesocarnivores and reducing their impacts on prey. The mesopredator release hypothesis therefore predicts prey abundance will be higher where large carnivores are present, but this prediction assumes limited dietary overlap between large and mesocarnivores. Where dietary overlap is high, e.g., among omnivorous carnivore species, or where prey are relatively easily accessible, the potential exists for large and mesocarnivores to have redundant impacts on prey, though this possibility has not been explored. The intertidal community represents a potentially important but poorly studied resource for coastal carnivore populations, and one for which dietary overlap between carnivores may be high. To evaluate usage of the intertidal community by coastal carnivores and the potential for redundancy between large and mesocarnivores, we surveyed (i) intertidal prey abundance (crabs and fish) and (ii) the abundance and activity of large carnivores (predominantly black bears) and mesocarnivores (raccoons and mink) in an area with an intact carnivore community in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Overall carnivore activity was strongly related to intertidal prey availability. Notably, this relationship was not contingent on carnivore species identity, suggestive of redundancy–high intertidal prey availability was associated with either greater large carnivore activity or greater mesocarnivore activity. We then compared intertidal prey abundances in this intact system, in which bears dominate, with those in a nearby system where bears and other large carnivores have been extirpated, and raccoons are the primary intertidal predator. We found significant similarities in intertidal species abundances, providing additional evidence for redundancy between large (bear) and mesocarnivore (raccoon) impacts on intertidal prey. Taken together, our results indicate that intertidal prey shape habitat use and competition among coastal carnivores, and raise the interesting possibility of redundancy between mesocarnivores and large carnivores in their role as intertidal top predators.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada     Liana Y.

Because large carnivores suppress mesocarnivore foraging, the community of species that mesocarnivores eat may differ substantially depending on the presence or absence of large carnivores [ 1 – 5 ]. Thus, the mesopredator release hypothesis [ 6 , 7 ] predicts that prey abundance and diversity will be higher where large carnivore abundance is high, relative to where large carnivores have been reduced or extirpated. This prediction will hold when dietary overlap between large carnivores and mesocarnivores is limited, for instance, when considering large carnivore populations (e.g., many continental populations of wolves Canis lupus and cougars Puma concolor ) that depend primarily on large ungulate prey [ 8 – 10 ], and thus exhibit narrower diets than sympatric mesocarnivores, which tend to be more omnivorous [ 11 , 12 ].  The consequences for the prey community are less clear when both large carnivores and mesocarnivores compete for the same resources. Intraguild predation theory suggests that predator species subject to suppression by and competition with a dominant predator may be more efficient at exploiting a shared resource [ 13 – 15 ], and thus the presence of large carnivores may benefit shared prey by suppressing the foraging of more efficient mesocarnivores. Alternatively, different carnivore species may be largely redundant in their impacts on prey, in which case differences in the carnivore community would be expected to have only minimal effects on prey abundance. Functional redundancy occurs when adding one or more species to a functional group does not substantially affect that group’s role in the community [ 16 – 19 ], and has been considered in assessing the impacts of multiple large carnivore species on shared ungulate prey [ 20 , 21 ]. However, the potential for redundancy has not been considered in studies of mammalian mesopredator release, which, as noted above, typically focus on large carnivore and mesocarnivore species with limited dietary overlap [ 3 , 6 , 7 , 11 ], and thus often detect substantial differences in the prey community in the presence and absence of large carnivores (e.g., [ 3 , 4 ]). Yet when large carnivores and mesocarnivores utilize the same resources, little change in the shared prey community may be expected if the potential exists for released mesocarnivores to assume the functional role of an extirpated large carnivore, e.g., through increased abundance and/or per capita impacts on prey [ 22 – 24 ], as has been demonstrated among invertebrate predators [ 19 ]. This may be particularly likely when the carnivore community contains highly omnivorous large carnivores and mesocarnivores with substantial dietary overlap [ 25 , 26 ]  For populations living at the terrestrial-marine interface, the potential for dietary overlap between carnivore species may be high. Marine derived foods, ranging from spawning fish to marine mammal carcasses, provide a major source of energy and nutrients to many coastal carnivore populations [ 18 , 27 – 29 ], a notable example being that of Pacific salmon ( Oncorhynchus spp.), which are consumed by a large number of carnivore species across the Pacific coast of North America every year during annual salmon runs [ 30 – 33 ]. Salmon are a particularly important food source for large carnivores–wolves [ 9 , 29 ] and bears ( Ursus spp.; [ 33 – 35 ])–which, due to dietary overlap, may compete strongly for salmon in some areas [ 29 ], and whose movement of salmon carcasses away from spawning streams has widespread ecosystem-level effects, spreading marine-derived nutrients throughout the terrestrial community [ 31 , 32 ]. The abundant invertebrates and small fish that are year-round residents in rocky intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats (hereafter referred to as “intertidal prey”) represent a similarly rich food source for coastal carnivore populations, and omnivorous foragers such as black bears ( Ursus americanus ) and raccoons ( Procyon lotor ), as well as largely aquatic foragers such as American mink ( Neovison vison ), overlap in their use of these intertidal prey [ 28 , 30 , 36 – 38 ]. However, unlike the well-described salmon-carnivore relationship, surprisingly few studies have gone beyond simply describing carnivore use of intertidal prey [ 28 ], providing a limited understanding of the ecological importance of this interaction, i.e., whether the availability of intertidal prey affects the terrestrial carnivore community and whether carnivore foraging in turn impacts intertidal prey.  In one of the only studies to consider the impacts of a mammalian carnivore on intertidal prey, Suraci et al. [ 5 ] experimentally demonstrated that carnivore foraging can indeed have widespread effects across the intertidal community, sharply reducing the abundance of the carnivore’s intertidal prey, and, through predation on other intertidal predators (e.g., crabs), cause further cascading effects on species not directly subject to carnivore predation [ 5 , 36 ]. Thus, mammalian carnivores can act as top predators in intertidal communities. This research was conducted on mesocarnivore raccoons in a system (the Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada) from which all native large carnivores were extirpated by humans a century ago [ 36 ], thereby releasing raccoons both from large carnivore predation, and from potential competition with large carnivores for access to intertidal resources. The mesopredator release hypothesis would predict that, where large carnivores persist, mesocarnivore impacts would be lessened and prey abundance would therefore be greater, but the relative abundance of intertidal prey in habitats with an intact carnivore community, i.e., one consisting of the full suite of large carnivores and mesocarnivores, remains unknown.  Here we examine the relationship between carnivores and intertidal prey in a coastal system supporting an intact carnivore community. Clayoquot Sound (hereafter “Clayoquot”), in British Columbia, Canada, supports three large carnivore species (black bears [hereafter, “bears”], wolves, and cougars), as well as several mesocarnivore species, including raccoons and mink [ 39 ]. With over 1,300 km of shoreline and many protected bays and inlets [ 40 ], there is ample opportunity for carnivores here to exploit intertidal prey. Bears in Clayoquot regularly forage in intertidal habitats [ 40 ], and have been observed to consume several of the same intertidal species (e.g., intertidal fish and shore crabs Hemigrapsus spp.; [ 40 ]) known to be important prey for mesocarnivores (raccoons and mink; [ 30 , 36 ]). Thus the potential exists for competition between large carnivores and mesocarnivores, and for redundancy in their impacts on intertidal prey (i.e., intertidal invertebrates and fish). In the present study we consider the interaction between the intertidal prey and coastal carnivore communities, showing that the availability of intertidal resources affects the distribution and community composition of carnivores that forage in the intertidal (hereafter, “intertidal carnivores”), but that the relative abundance of large carnivores and mesocarnivores at a site does not appear to affect intertidal prey, suggesting that redundancy in the impacts of different carnivore species may exist. We then compare intertidal prey abundances in Clayoquot with those in the nearby Gulf Islands, a system which lacks large carnivores [ 36 ], providing further evidence suggestive of redundancy between large carnivores and mesocarnivores in their impacts on intertidal prey.    Methods   Overview and study area  Clayoquot is located on the remote central west coast of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada (49°23′ to 49°04′ N, 126°13 to 125°45′). Terrestrial habitat in Clayoquot consists of old growth and second growth temperate rainforest dominated by coastal western hemlock ( Tsuga heterophylla ), and the adjacent shoreline is a complex of rocky intertidal and mudflat habitat. The present study covered approximately 156 km 2 in the southeastern section of Clayoquot, occurring entirely within the Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Ten shoreline sites, separated by an average minimum distance of 3.1 (± 1.4 SD) km, were chosen based on the presence of cobble-boulder shoreline, an intertidal habitat type in which all of the large carnivore and mesocarnivore species noted above were observed during preliminary surveys, and which is known to be productive foraging habitat for many carnivore species, given the availability of intertidal invertebrates and fish [ 30 , 36 , 40 ]. All sites were located in sheltered waters several kilometers from the open ocean. At each site we estimated (1) the relative abundance of large carnivores and mesocarnivores using camera traps and scat surveys, and (2) the availability of marine prey using intertidal quadrat sampling and shallow subtidal crab trapping.    Carnivore relative abundance  At each site, we deployed three camera traps (Moultrie M-990i, Moultrie Products, LLC, USA), spaced 154 (± 68 SD) m apart. Camera traps were set along the shoreline just above the high tide line (mean ± SD distance to forest edge = 1.1 ± 1.5 m) at an average height of 0.85 (± 0.26 SD) m, and directed towards the water to be triggered by mammals foraging or transiting in the intertidal. We confirmed that aspects of camera set-up did not differ between sites in ways that could affect the ability of camera traps to capture images of carnivores in the intertidal, using Spearman’s rank correlation to test whether site-level average values of four camera set-up properties were correlated with the number of carnivore images recorded per camera-day (minimum distance to a neighboring camera: P = 0.26, slope of shoreline on which the camera was set: P = 0.73, distance from the forest edge: P = 0.89, camera height: P = 0.56). Two camera traps at each site were programmed to record photographs (3 photos per triggering event) and the third camera was programmed to record 90 s (day) or 30 s (night) videos. All cameras were programmed to retrigger after a 5 s delay. Camera traps were set between 14 June and 27 August 2015. At each site, the mean number of days during which at least one camera was active was 73.3 (range 71 to 75) d, resulting in a total of 733 camera-days across all sites. When quantifying the relative abundance of mammalian carnivores from camera trap images and videos, we considered recordings of a given species as independent occurrences only if they were separated by at least 60 min from recordings of the same species on any of the three cameras at a site (i.e., within a site, camera traps were considered to be non-independent). Preliminary review of camera trap records indicated that this 60 min cut-off minimized the likelihood of recounting the same individual passing in front of the camera trap multiple times during a single intertidal foraging bout, and is relatively conservative compared to the cut-off used in previous camera trap studies of mammalian carnivores [ 5 , 41 , 42 ]. In all results reported below, we express the relative abundance of carnivores as individuals per camera-day, where camera-days are the total number of days that at least one camera was active at a site ( Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170255.t001  Table 1  Relative abundance of large carnivores and mesocarnivores at the ten study sites, as determined by camera trapping and scat transects.

We conducted scat transects twice at each site between 01 July and 25 August 2015, with the two sampling occasions at a given site separated by at least 23 days (mean ± SD = 32 ± 8 d). Scat transects covered 1 km of shoreline, centered on the location of the camera traps, and were divided into two 500-m sections [ 43 ]. Two researchers conducted all scat transects, with each individual searching one 500-m section on foot during each sampling occasion. Transects covered both the high shore, extending ~ 5 m out from the forest edge, and the section of forest immediately adjacent to the shoreline, extending ~ 15 m in from the tree line. For all mammal scats encountered, the researcher noted the species, along with an estimate of their certainty regarding species identification (high, medium, or low). Only scats identified with high or medium certainty were included in the analyses described below. Carnivore relative abundance estimates from scat transects were expressed as the number of scats encountered per 500 m ( Table 1 ).    Marine prey availability  Previous work in the Gulf Islands, BC, Canada (located off the southeast coast of Vancouver Island, approximately 140 km from our Clayoquot study sites) indicated that a suite of intertidal and shallow subtidal species, which occur in both the Gulf Islands and Clayoquot, are common prey items for mammalian carnivores foraging in the intertidal [ 36 ], and observations in Clayoquot confirm that these prey items are also commonly used by bears in this region [ 40 ]. In estimating marine prey availability in Clayoqout, we therefore focused our sampling efforts on this suite of marine species, which includes shore crabs ( Hemigrapsus oregonensis and H . nudus ), prickleback fish (family Stichaeidae), and red rock crabs ( Cancer productus ). The abundance of shore crabs and prickleback fish was estimated using intertidal quadrat sampling, following methods described previously [ 5 , 36 ]. Briefly, at each site we sampled ten 0.25 x 0.25 m 2 quadrats in both the high and mid intertidal zones (see [ 36 ] for a description of intertidal zones). Quadrats were spaced at 5-m intervals along a 50-m transect line that ran parallel to the water line, and all quadrat sampling was conducted within the section of shoreline covered by camera traps. Following Suraci et al. [ 36 ], all shore crabs were grouped into three size classes based on carapace width: small ≤ 1.3 cm, medium = 1.31–2.0 cm, large > 2.0 cm. Previous work indicated that carnivore predation on shore crabs is largely restricted to the two larger size classes [ 36 ], and we therefore focused our sampling efforts on medium and large shore crabs. Quadrat sampling took place between 03 June and 17 July 2015.  Following Suraci et al. [ 36 ], we estimated the abundance of red rock crabs across 1 km of shoreline at each site (centered on the location of the camera traps) by setting ten collapsible mesh crab traps in the shallow subtidal zone, just below the lowest low water line. Traps were spaced at 100-m intervals, baited with ~200 g of frozen herring, and left in place for 24 hrs. Red rock crabs undertake daily movements from the shallow subtidal into the intertidal [ 44 ] where they become available to terrestrial mammalian predators, and we previously reported that raccoon predation on red rock crabs in the intertidal affects the size of the shallow subtidal population [ 5 , 36 ]. The abundance of red rock crabs in the shallow subtidal thus provides a useful estimate of availability of red rock crabs to intertidal foraging carnivores. Crab trapping was performed between 02 June and 27 July 2015.    Ethics statement  All sampling was conducted in accordance with of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and approved by the University of Victoria Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol numbers 2015-004(1) and 2014-021(1)). Marine prey sampling was approved by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (scientific license number XR 108 2015). Fieldwork was carried out on public lands, on the traditional territory of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation (with permission from the Tla-o-qui-aht Chief and Council), and within the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve (under permit number PRN-2015-18256).    Statistical analysis   Large carnivore-mesocarnivore interactions  For all models described below, model assumptions were checked using statistical tests for normality and homogeneity of variance, and model fit was visually inspected using residual versus fitted value plots and quantile–quantile plots [ 45 ]. All analyses were conducted in R [ 46 ].  To investigate whether large carnivores may restrict mesocarnivore use of intertidal habitats in Clayoquot, we first tested for an effect of the relative abundance of large carnivores on mesocarnivore relative abundance using camera trap data (i.e., individuals per camera-day), treating sites (n = 10) as independent sampling units. We used generalized linear models (GLM) with a quasi-Poisson error distribution (to account for overdispersion in response variables [ 45 ]), using the total number of mesocarnivore recordings at a given site as our response variable, and including number of camera-days at the site as an offset to correct for sampling effort. The explanatory variable in all models was the number of large carnivores per camera-day. Four GLM analyses were performed with camera trap data. (1) We first analyzed the effect of all large carnivores (bears, wolves, and cougars) on all mesocarnivores (raccoons and mink) by pooling large carnivore and mesocarnivore recordings at a given site. As discussed below, bears were the numerically dominant large carnivore at most sites (indicated by both camera traps and scat transects) and are known to regularly exploit intertidal food [ 37 , 40 ]. Thus we also tested for an effect of bear relative abundance on the relative abundance of (2) all mesocarnivores, (3) just raccoons, and (4) just mink. The significance of the effect of large carnivore abundance in all quasi-Poisson GLM models was assessed using F-tests [ 45 ].  Large carnivores were detected at nine of the ten study sites and, as mentioned above, at most of these sites, bears were the numerically dominant large carnivore (see Table 1 and Results ). The sole exception to this pattern was Grice Bay, one of only two sites at which bears were never detected. Grice Bay is the only site at which wolves were regularly recorded on camera traps ( Table 1 ), with one or two individual wolves being recorded on 20 occasions (approximately every 4 days) throughout the duration of the study. Wolves are known to prey heavily on mesocarnivores in Clayoquot [ 47 ], and have been noted to harass and kill bears here and elsewhere [ 9 , 48 – 50 ]. Thus the absence of bears at Grice Bay may be attributable to the relatively high rates of wolf activity at this site, which may also affect habitat use by mesopredators. For this reason, the analyses of camera trap data that focused on interactions between bears and mesopredators (GLMs 2, 3, and 4 above) were run both with (n = 10 sites) and without (n = 9 sites) data from Grice Bay. Conclusions regarding the effects of bear relative abundance on mesopredator relative abundance were not affected by excluding Grice Bay (significance of bear abundance, as determined by F-tests, was unaffected). Nonetheless, given the potential confounding effect of high wolf activity at Grice Bay on both bear and mesocarnivore relative abundance at this site, we have chosen to present results below for models from which Grice Bay was excluded.  Scat transect data provides a complementary, but more coarse-scale estimate of carnivore relative abundance compared to that provided by camera traps, and was thus used solely to corroborate the general pattern of large carnivore and mesocarnivore relative abundance detected in camera trap data. Bear scats constituted all but one of the large carnivore scats detected (99.5% of 209 large carnivore scats; a single wolf scat was found at Grice Bay, Table 1 ), and preliminary investigation of scat data suggested that the number of mesocarnivore scats showed a threshold effect in relation to bear abundance, being relatively high at sites at which no bear scats were found, and then dropping off quickly and remaining low at all sites where bear scats were present. We therefore tested for an effect of bear presence or absence (based on the presence or absence of scats) on the relative abundance of mesocarnivore scats detected, categorizing sites at which no bear scats were found as “bear-absent” (n = 3) and sites at which at least one bear scat was found as “bear-present” (n = 7). Consistent with scat transects providing more coarse-scale data than camera traps, one of the study sites at which no bear scats were found (Fundy Creek) showed low but detectable bear activity on camera traps (0.4 bears per camera night, see Table 1 ). However, to determine whether scat data corroborated the results of camera trap data, it was necessary to treat these two data sets separately, and Fundy Creek was therefore included as “bear-absent” in the scat analyses. Our response variable for these analyses consisted of the number of mesocarnivore scats encountered on each of two 500-m transect sections at a site, each of which was sampled on two occasions (i.e., n = 4 scat estimates per site, see above). These data were analyzed with Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models (GLMM) with a Poisson distribution, including site as a random effect. We included as explanatory variables bear presence or absence (based on scats), observer ID (i.e., the researcher who performed the transect section), and sampling occasion (i.e., whether data were from the first or second sampling occasion of a given transect section), as well as the two-way interactions between bear presence or absence and both observer ID and sampling occasion ( S1 Table ). We used separate GLMMs to test for the effects of bear presence or absence on the relative abundance of (1) all mesocarnivores, (2) just raccoons, and (3) just mink. None of these models showed evidence of overdispersion (ratio of residual deviance to residual DF < 1.3 for all models). The significance of main effects and interactions was tested using Type II Wald’s χ 2 -Test [ 51 ].  Finally, our camera traps recorded the time of day at which all animal recordings were made, and we used time data from independent recordings of large carnivores and mesocarnivores to assess whether large carnivores may restrict mesocarnivore temporal activity along shorelines in Clayoquot. Following Ridout and Linkie [ 52 ] (see also [ 53 ]) we estimated the coefficient of overlap (Δ 4 ) in temporal activity of mesocarnivores and large carnivores. This metric is based on the kernel density of observations of two animal species/groups across a 24-hr period (ignoring the date on which a given observation was made) and ranges between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (complete overlap) [ 52 , 53 ]. Below we present the estimated temporal overlap between large carnivores and mesocarnivores (Δ 4 ) along with the 95% confidence interval based on 10,000 bootstrap replicates (following [ 53 ]).    Marine prey abundance and intertidal carnivore activity  To examine the relationship between marine prey availability and the intertidal carnivore community, we calculated metrics to describe (1) the overall availability of marine prey, as estimated from quadrat sampling and crab trapping, and (2) the relative abundance of all intertidal foraging mammalian carnivores, as estimated from camera trapping. To calculate overall prey availability at a given site, it was necessary to standardize estimates of the intertidal abundance of shore crabs and prickleback fish, and the shallow subtidal abundance of red rock crabs, as these abundances were estimated using different sampling methodologies. For each prey type, we therefore took the total number of individuals encountered in all quadrats (shore crabs and prickleback fish) or crab traps (red rock crabs) at a given site, and divided this total by the standard deviation of all site-level total abundances for that prey type across the ten sites (i.e., scaled the site-level values by their standard deviation [ 54 ]). These standardized prey abundance values for each prey type were then summed to produce our metric of prey availability.  In estimating the relative abundance of all intertidal foraging carnivores at a given site, we focused on those species directly observed to spend large amounts of time foraging in the intertidal; namely, bears, raccoons, and mink. Wolves and cougars both occur and likely hunt in the intertidal (pinnipeds are a major prey item for both wolves and cougars in Clayoquot; [ 47 ]), and wolves are known to occasionally forage on small intertidal invertebrates and fish [ 9 ]. However direct observations and camera trap data both indicate that, at least at our study sites, the vast majority of intertidal carnivore activity is accounted for by bears and mesocarnivores, and these were the only species observed (either directly or via camera trap videos) actively foraging on small intertidal prey. To estimate site-level intertidal carnivore activity, we used data on the relative abundances of bears and mesocarnivores (raccoons and mink) from camera traps (i.e., individuals per camera-day). Rather than simply summing the total number of intertidal carnivores recorded, it was again necessary to standardize our estimates of bears and mesocarnivores per camera-day at a given site by their respective standard deviations [ 54 ] to account for potential differences in the ability of camera traps to detect bears and mesocarnivores, given their substantial differences in body size (bears are several times larger than both raccoons and mink). Standardized values of bears and mesocarnivores per camera-day were then summed to give our intertidal carnivore activity metric. We used linear regression to test for an effect of prey availability on intertidal carnivore activity and, as for the camera trap data described above, conducted our analyses both including (n = 10) and excluding (n = 9) Grice Bay, our only study site at which wolf activity was high. These analyses again produced consistent results in terms of the significance of the relationship between prey availability and intertidal carnivore activity and, for reasons discussed above, we again only present the analyses from which Grice Bay was excluded.  The above intertidal carnivore activity metric provides an estimate of the overall carnivore activity at a site, but does not provide information on the structure of the carnivore community (e.g., whether a site is dominated by bears or mesocarnivores). To quantify intertidal carnivore community structure, we conducted Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on the relative abundances (individuals per camera-day) of bears, raccoons, and mink at each site. Principal components were calculated using the correlation matrix of these three variables, to account for substantially higher variance in bear data than in mesopredator data [ 55 ]. The first principal component (PC1) explained 67% of variation among these three carnivore abundance variables. Bear relative abundance was positively associated with PC1 (loading = 0.583), and both raccoon and mink relative abundances were negatively associated with PC1 (loadings = -0.592 and -0.556, respectively), indicating that high positive or negative values of PC1 describe a bear-dominated or mesocarnivore-dominated intertidal carnivore community, respectively ( S1 Fig ). To provide insight on the relationship between marine prey availability and the structure of the intertidal carnivore community, PC1 scores for each site were used to produce the coloring for points in Fig 2.     Comparison of intertidal prey abundances where large carnivores are extant or extirpated  We previously reported a strong relationship between intertidal foraging mammalian carnivores and the intertidal prey community in the Gulf Islands, a system from which all native large carnivores (bears, wolves, and cougars) have been extirpated, and where mesocarnivores (predominantly raccoons) are now the only intertidal carnivores [ 5 , 36 ]. Suraci et al. [ 36 ] showed that the presence of raccoons on Gulf Islands led to significant reductions in the abundance of marine prey (including shore crabs, prickleback fish, and red rock crabs), relative to Gulf Islands on which raccoons are absent. To assess whether differences in the mammalian carnivore community (i.e., the presence or absence of large carnivores) may lead to differences in the nearshore marine community, we compared intertidal prey abundances in Clayoquot (this study) with abundances of intertidal prey on raccoon-present and raccoon-absent Gulf Islands [ 36 ]. As reported in Suraci et al. [ 36 ], we used the same methods described above to quantify intertidal prey abundance (quadrat sampling in both the high and mid intertidal zones and shallow subtidal crab trapping) on six raccoon-present and six raccoon-absent Gulf Islands. In the present comparison, for prey species quantified in quadrats we focused our analyses on the intertidal zone in which the species was most abundant (high zone for shore crabs and mid zone for prickleback fish), as this is where Suraci et al. [ 36 ] detected the strongest differences between raccoon-present and raccoon-absent Gulf Islands. All quadrat data were expressed as the average number of individuals per m 2 across all quadrats sampled in either the high or mid intertidal zone at a given site, and red rock crab abundances were expressed as the total number of individuals caught in all crab traps (n = 10 crab traps at each site). We used Wilcoxon’s Rank Sum test with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons to compare the abundances of (1) medium shore crabs, (2) large shore crabs, (3) prickleback fish, and (4) red rock crabs between Clayoquot (n = 10) and both raccoon-present (n = 6) and raccoon absent (n = 6) Gulf Islands.  Below we report intertidal prey abundances from habitats in which large carnivores are extant (Clayoquot) or extirpated (all Gulf Islands), and where overall carnivore abundance is high (Clayoquot and raccoon-present Gulf Islands) or low (raccoon-absent Gulf Islands). Raccoons are the numerically dominant carnivore in the Gulf Islands, and thus, where raccoons are absent, overall carnivore abundance is indeed relatively low. Suraci et al. [ 36 ] describe nocturnal, boat based transects to survey carnivore relative abundance on shorelines in the Gulf Islands, and report that, across all 12 study islands (including raccoon-absent islands), average raccoon relative abundance was 1.77 individuals per km of shoreline surveyed. Two other species of mesocarnivore–mink and river otters ( Lontra canadensis )–occur in the Gulf Islands and were quantified on these same boat based transects, and were found to occur at low relative abundances across all Gulf Islands surveyed (mean ± SD = 0.24 ± 0.26 individuals km -1 ). Further, the relative abundance of mink and river otters did not differ between raccoon-present and raccoon-absent islands (raccoon-present islands: mean ± SD = 0.23 ± 0.22 individuals km -1 ; raccoon-absent: 0.24 ± 0.31 individuals km -1 ; Wilcoxon’s W = 20.5, P = 1.0).     Results  We recorded 418 independent (i.e., separated by ≥ 60 min) images and videos of mammalian carnivores across the 10 sites and 733 camera-days of the study, and identified a total of 478 carnivore scats across all scat transects. These data showed a strong gradient in both mesocarnivore and large carnivore relative abundance among our study sites. Mesocarnivores (raccoons and mink) were present at all sites, as determined by both camera traps and scat transects, but their relative abundance varied substantially across sites, ranging from 0.01 to 0.42 individuals per camera-day and 1.3 to 21.8 scats per 500 m ( Table 1 ). Large carnivores (bears, wolves, and cougars) were detected via camera traps at all but one site (large carnivore scats were found at eight of ten sites), with relative abundances again showing substantial variation between sites (camera trap range = 0 to 1.37 individuals per camera-day, scat transect range = 0 to 14.0 scats per 500 m; Table 1 ). As noted above, bears were the numerically dominant large carnivore at all but one site (Grice Bay, where wolf activity was exceptionally high, see Table 1 ).   Effect of large carnivores on mesocarnivore intertidal habitat use  The presence and relative abundance of large carnivores significantly affected mesocarnivore intertidal habitat use. The number of mesocarnivores per camera-day at a site decreased significantly with both the total number of large carnivores per camera-day (GLM; F 1 , 8 = 14.97, P = 0.005; Fig 1A ), and the number of bears per camera-day ( F 1 , 7 = 14.73, P = 0.006). When considering mesocarnivore species separately, the number of bears per camera-day also showed a significant negative effect on raccoons per camera-day ( F 1 , 7 = 9.68, P = 0.017, Fig 1B ) and a marginally significant negative effect on mink per camera-day ( F 1 , 7 = 5.12, P = 0.058, Fig 1C ). Scat transect data corroborated the strong negative effect of bears on mesocarnivore intertidal habitat use, with the number of total mesocarnivore, raccoon, and mink scats per 500 m all being significantly lower at sites where bear scat was detected, relative to sites where no bear scat was found (GLMM; total mesocarnivore scats: Wald’s χ 2 1 = 18.99, P < 0.001; raccoon scats: χ 2 1 = 8.63, P = 0.003; mink scats: χ 2 1 = 17.57, P < 0.001; see S1 Table and S2 Fig ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170255.g001  Fig 1   Relationship between large carnivore relative abundance and mesocarnivore relative abundance across ten study sites in Clayoquot, as determined by camera traps.  Plots show the relative abundances (i.e., individuals per camera-day) of (a) all large carnivores and all mesocarnivores, (b) bears and raccoons, and (c) bears and mink. Lines represent Poisson GLM estimates of the relationship between mesocarnivore and large carnivore relative abundance, and shaded areas denote standard errors of model estimates. Grice Bay (GB) is indicated in all plots. Grice Bay showed exceptionally high levels of wolf activity and was excluded from the GLM analyses performed on data presented in (b) and (c) (see Methods for details).       Large carnivore and mesocarnivore temporal activity  Mesocarnivores were largely nocturnal, with 81.9% of all mesocarnivore recordings on camera traps (90.5% of raccoon and 75.0% of mink) occurring between the hours of 22:00 and 05:00 ( S3 Fig ). Overall, large carnivore activity along shorelines was mostly diurnal (96.6% of large carnivore recordings occurred between 05:00 and 22:00; S3 Fig ), and bears were almost strictly diurnal in their intertidal foraging behaviour, with 98.7% of bear recordings occurring during daylight hours. Wolf activity was also largely diurnal (80%), while cougar recordings, though entirely nocturnal, were relatively rare ( Table 1 ). The contrasting shoreline activity schedules of mesocarnivores and large carnivores resulted in limited temporal overlap between these groups ( coefficient of overlap Δ 4 = 27.6 [95% CI: 19.3–36.2]).    Relationship between marine prey availability and intertidal carnivore activity  Independent of carnivore community composition, marine prey availability at a site was a strong predictor of the overall relative abundance of intertidal foraging carnivores. Overall intertidal carnivore activity increased significantly with marine prey availability (linear regression; F 1 , 7 = 22.17, P = 0.002, R 2 = 0.73; Fig 2 ), regardless of whether the carnivore community at a given site was dominated by bears or mesocarnivores. The intertidal carnivore PCA (see coloring of points in Fig 2 ) indicated that sites with high marine prey availability showed high levels of intertidal activity by either bears (red symbols in Fig 2 ) or mesocarnivores (blue symbols in Fig 2 ), while both bears and mesocarnivores appeared to avoid sites at which marine prey were relatively scarce (mid-spectrum symbols in Fig 2 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170255.g002  Fig 2   Relationship between intertidal prey availability and the overall activity of intertidal foraging carnivores (bears and mesocarnivores) in Clayoquot.  Prey availability and intertidal carnivore activity are scaled metrics of prey abundance and carnivore relative abundance, respectively, and thus do not have units (see Methods for details on calculating these metrics). Coloring of points reflects site-level scores for the first principal component of a PCA describing carnivore community structure, where high values (red) represent bear dominated sites, low values (blue) represent mesocarnivore dominated sites, and middling values (mid-spectrum colors) represent sites with mixed, but relatively low carnivore abundance (see also S1 Fig ). Solid and dashed lines represent linear regression estimates (± SE) of the relationship between prey availability and intertidal carnivore activity. Grice Bay (GB) was excluded from this regression analysis, as described in the methods.       Intertidal prey abundances where large carnivores are extant or extirpated  In general, intertidal prey abundances were lower where the relative abundance of carnivores was high (Clayoquot and raccoon-present Gulf Islands) than where carnivore relative abundance was low (raccoon-absent Gulf Islands), consistent with carnivores functioning as top intertidal predators; and there were few differences in intertidal prey abundances between where large carnivores remained extant (Clayoquot) and where they have been extirpated (raccoon-present Gulf Islands), consistent with large carnivores and mesocarnivores having functionally redundant impacts on intertidal prey. Abundances of both medium and large shore crabs ( Fig 3A and 3B ) were indistinguishable between locations with high carnivore abundance (Clayoquot and raccoon-present Gulf Islands), regardless of carnivore identity, and were marginally (medium shore crabs) or significantly (large shore crabs) lower where large carnivores remained extant (Clayoquot) than where carnivore abundance was low (raccoon-absent Gulf Islands [medium shore crabs: Clayoquot vs. raccoon-present Gulf Islands, Wilcoxon’s W = 20.5, Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.647; Clayoquot vs. raccoon-absent Gulf Islands, W = 50, P = 0.057; large shore crabs: Clayoquot vs. raccoon-present, W = 38.5, P = 0.696; Clayoquot vs. raccoon-absent, W = 54, P = 0.007]). Similarly, red rock crab abundances ( Fig 3D ) were not significantly different between locations with high carnivore abundance (Clayoquot and raccoon-present Gulf Islands), while being significantly lower where large carnivores remained extant (Clayoquot) than where carnivore abundance was low (raccoon-absent Gulf Islands [Clayoquot vs. raccoon-present Gulf Islands: W = 46, P = 0.176; Clayoquot vs. raccoon-absent Gulf Islands: W = 59, P = 0.001]). Prickleback fish were the exception to this trend ( Fig 3C ); prickleback fish abundances in Clayoquot were intermediate between those of raccoon-present and raccoon-absent Gulf Islands, and not significantly different from either (Clayoquot vs. raccoon-present Gulf Islands: W = 13, P = 0.131; Clayoquot vs. raccoon-absent Gulf Islands: W = 38, P = 0.822).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170255.g003  Fig 3   Comparison of intertidal prey abundances where large carnivores are extant (Clayoquot) or extirpated (Gulf Islands).

Discussion  We found that the composition of the mammalian carnivore community in coastal habitats of Clayoquot was determined both by interactions between carnivore species and by the availability of intertidal prey, indicating that intertidal prey abundance shapes habitat use and competition among this guild of terrestrial predators. Further, carnivore community composition (i.e., the relative abundance of large carnivores and mesocarnivores) appears to have little relevance to impacts on intertidal prey abundance, both within Clayoquot, and when comparing between locations where large carnivores are extant (Clayoquot) or have been extirpated (Gulf Islands), suggesting that foraging by large carnivores and mesocarnivores may have largely similar top-down effects on the intertidal community.  Regardless of community composition, the overall activity of carnivores on shorelines in Clayoquot was strongly related to the availability of intertidal prey ( Fig 2 ). The highest relative abundances of both bears and mesocarnivores (raccoons and mink) were observed at sites with relatively high intertidal prey availability, confirming that this marine food source is an important resource for coastal carnivore populations. Intertidal invertebrates and fish may be a particularly key resource for bears in this area, with individuals being present daily at some of the sites with the highest prey availability ( Table 1 ). Other marine food sources, including herring eggs [ 37 ] and spawning salmon [ 35 , 56 ] provide crucial but ephemeral sources of energy and protein for coastal bear populations, and intertidal prey may be important in supporting these populations where and when other marine foods are not available. Indeed, the impact of bears on intertidal prey may shift seasonally with changes in the availability of alternative food sources, though this possibility has not yet been explored.  Raccoons and mink in Clayoquot also appear to track intertidal prey availability, but given the abundance of large carnivores here, access to this resource may be secondary to the presence of potential predators and dominant competitors in driving mesocarnivore activity and habitat use. Mesocarnivore relative abundance was highest at sites where both intertidal prey availability was high and large carnivore relative abundance was low ( Fig 2 ), but declined quickly with increasing large carnivore relative abundance ( Fig 1 ), indicating that large carnivores, and specifically bears, readily exclude raccoons and mink from high quality coastal habitats. Large carnivores may also restrict mesocarnivore temporal activity at coastal sites, further limiting their access to marine resources and potentially reducing the per capita impacts of mesocarnivores on intertidal prey. Raccoon and mink activity was largely nocturnal ( S3 Fig ), and showed little overlap with the predominantly diurnal shoreline activity of bears and wolves, which may reduce the risk of harassment and predation from these species [ 41 , 57 , 58 ], but may also prevent these mesocarnivores from exploiting daytime low tides (which mesocarnivores are known to do where large carnivores are absent [ 5 , 36 ]; see below). Studies from continental systems have similarly found that large carnivore activity restricts mesocarnivore local abundance [ 3 , 4 , 59 , 60 ] and activity patterns [ 41 ], typically through interference competition or direct predation. In our system raccoons and mink may be additionally subjected to exploitative competition with bears, a dominant competitor for intertidal resources, which may further reduce mesocarnivore activity at bear dominated sites through reduced availability of prey, though our data do not allow us to test this hypothesis directly.  Consistent with large carnivores and mesocarnivores having redundant impacts on intertidal prey, the composition of the carnivore community at a given site at Clayoquot did not appear to affect intertidal prey availability ( Fig 2 )–sites with the highest levels of either bear or mesocarnivore (raccoon and mink) activity all showed a similarly high availability of intertidal prey. This could indicate that carnivore foraging has limited effects on the abundance of intertidal species, however this is unlikely, given our previous research experimentally demonstrating that raccoon foraging significantly reduces the abundances of the same suite of intertidal prey [ 5 , 36 ]. Instead, we suggest that the similarity in prey availability between sites with high bear activity and sites with high raccoon and mink activity indicate a similarity between large carnivores and mesocarnivores in their top-down effects on the intertidal community. This is further supported by our comparison of intertidal prey abundance between Clayoquot, where bears are the dominant intertidal foragers, and the Gulf Islands, where bears and all other large carnivores are absent, and mesocarnivores (mainly raccoons) are now the only mammalian predators of intertidal prey. This comparison ( Fig 3 ) shows that, for most prey types, abundances are similar between locations with high carnivore abundance (Clayoquot and raccoon-present Gulf Islands), regardless of whether large carnivores (specifically bears) are extant (Clayoquot) or extirpated (raccoon-present Gulf Islands), and are substantially lower than where overall carnivore abundance is low (raccoon-absent Gulf Islands).  Despite the similarities in habitat type (cobble-boulder beaches) and wave exposure (sheltered water ways, see above) between our study sites in Clayoquot and the Gulf Islands, the geographic separation between these locations (approximately 140 km) may affect the baseline abundances of intertidal prey (e.g., through potential differences in nutrient availability). Nonetheless, the broad overlap in intertidal prey abundance between Clayoquot and raccoon-present Gulf Islands points to possible functional redundancy between large carnivores and mesocarnivores, and specifically between bears and raccoons, in their role as top predators in intertidal communities. In the context of our study system, redundancy would mean that the top-down effects of mammalian carnivores on intertidal prey are equivalent regardless of whether the intertidal carnivore community contains just raccoons or both raccoons and bears, and could occur if raccoons increase in abundance and/or per capita impacts on intertidal prey [ 22 – 24 ] following large carnivore extirpation. Our previous research suggests that raccoon relative abundance along shorelines is substantially higher in the Gulf Islands than in Clayoquot [ 36 ], and that the absence of native large carnivores in the Gulf Islands allows raccoons to dramatically increase their impacts on intertidal prey, in part by allowing raccoons to exploit both nocturnal and diurnal low tides [ 5 , 36 ]. In Clayoquot, raccoon impacts are likely substantially lower, as their presence in the intertidal is evidently strongly restricted by large carnivore activity. However, given the high degree of omnivory and dietary overlap between bears and raccoons, this does not translate to higher abundances of intertidal prey. Instead, predation by bears appears to suppress intertidal prey to similarly low levels.  Further research is needed to confirm the observed similarity between bear and raccoon impacts on the intertidal prey community. However if this pattern holds true, it suggests that, when released from top down control by, and competition with, large carnivores, mesocarnivores may in some cases fill the now vacant niche of their former predator/competitor. This is an unexpected potential outcome of mesopredator release, studies of which often detect substantial differences in the prey community in the presence and absence of large carnivores (e.g., [ 3 , 4 ]) rather than the broad similarities observed here. The potential for mesocarnivores to partially assume the functional role of an extirpated large carnivore may exist more generally in carnivore communities containing highly omnivorous species, and could provide an important source of resiliency against the disturbance caused by anthropogenic large carnivore declines [ 24 ]. Omnivory has been suggested to be a stabilizing force in food webs in general [ 25 , 61 ], but the potential for omnivory among carnivores to act as a buffer against anthropogenic species loss has not been explored.  It is important to note, however, that bears and raccoons are both generalist foragers whose ecological effects are likely to extend far beyond the intertidal community [ 35 , 62 , 63 ]. For instance, raccoons are major predators on nesting songbirds, both in the Gulf Islands and elsewhere, and are frequently implicated in songbird declines [ 36 , 62 , 64 ], while bears are a crucial component of the well-studied salmon-carnivore system described above, capable of removing large numbers of salmon from spawning streams [ 31 , 35 ]. Thus the functional overlap between these two species may be limited to their effects on the intertidal prey community, and there is no question of raccoons fully replacing the ecological role of bears in areas where they have been extirpated.  The shoreline is an important source of food for many coastal carnivore populations [ 27 – 29 ], and here we show that the community of invertebrates and small fish in rocky intertidal habitats provide a valuable resource for these terrestrial predators, helping to shape habitat use and competition between carnivore species. Coastal areas across the globe also support high-density human populations [ 65 ], and the composition of the mammalian carnivore community in many regions may largely be a product of anthropogenic disturbance, dominated by human-tolerant mesocarnivores and lacking large carnivores. Our results raise the possibility that, in some cases, a shift from an intact carnivore community to one with no large carnivores may have limited consequences for the intertidal community due to redundancy in the functional role of mammalian carnivores as intertidal predators. However, the otherwise well-described repercussions of worldwide large carnivore declines [ 66 ] have not been well assessed for coastal ecosystems, and further research is necessary to understand the impacts of large carnivore losses on intertidal communities.

Bacteria can be considered as biological nanofactories that manufacture a cornucopia of bioproducts most notably recombinant proteins. As such, they must perfectly match with appropriate plasmid vectors to ensure successful overexpression of target genes. Among many parameters that correlate positively with protein productivity plasmid copy number plays pivotal role. Therefore, development of new and more accurate methods to assess this critical parameter will result in optimization of expression of plasmid-encoded genes. In this study, we present a simple and highly accurate method for quantifying plasmid copy number utilizing an EvaGreen single colour, droplet digital PCR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by examining the copy number of the pBR322 vector within Escherichia coli DH5α cells. The obtained results were successfully validated by real-time PCR. However, we observed a strong dependency of the plasmid copy number on the method chosen for isolation of the total DNA. We found that application of silica-membrane-based columns for DNA purification or DNA isolation with use of bead-beating, a mechanical cell disruption lead to determination of an average of 20.5 or 7.3 plasmid copies per chromosome, respectively. We found that recovery of the chromosomal DNA from purification columns was less efficient than plasmid DNA (46.5 ± 1.9% and 87.4 ± 5.5%, respectively) which may lead to observed differences in plasmid copy number. Besides, the plasmid copy number variations dependent on DNA template isolation method, we found that droplet digital PCR is a very convenient method for measuring bacterial plasmid content. Careful determination of plasmid copy number is essential for better understanding and optimization of recombinant proteins production process. Droplet digital PCR is a very precise method that allows performing thousands of individual PCR reactions in a single tube. The ddPCR does not depend on running standard curves and is a straightforward and reliable method to quantify the plasmid copy number. Therefore we believe that the ddPCR designed in this study will be widely used for any plasmid copy number calculation in the future.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281  Narodowe Centrum Nauki    N302 654240   Tadeusz Kaczorowski     This work was supported by Narodowe Centrum Nauki grant no.

In a rapidly growing field of gene therapy and genetic vaccination, naked or lipid-coated plasmid DNA is also successfully applied to administer therapeutic genes [ 3 ] and is considered to be much safer and easier to use than genetically modified viruses [ 4 , 5 ]. Moreover, plasmid-oriented studies provide insights to improve understanding of DNA replication, maintenance and transfer strategies which are essential to all microorganisms [ 6 , 7 ]. In this respect, among many features that characterize these mobile genetic elements, the one which defines the number of plasmid units that are contained inside one bacterial cell is especially important, both from a practical and a biological point of view.  Plasmid copy number (PCN) determines the gene dosage which is defined theoretically as number of genetic units accessible for expression. Therefore, quantification of the plasmid copy number is crucial in describing an expression system and exerts strong impact on protein production [ 8 ]. Generally, high-copy plasmids are preferred for efficient overproduction of recombinant proteins that do not affect the host viability, but in case of toxic or unstable proteins, usually low-copy plasmids are used [ 1 ].  Numerous methods that have been developed for calculating the plasmid copy number can be divided into two main categories: the direct and the indirect methods. The latter include the correlation of plasmid copy number with the activity of an enzyme/protein coded on the plasmid [ 8 ]. The examples include β-lactamase, luciferase or green fluorescent reporter protein [ 9 – 11 ]. These methods are prone to errors because the activity of such enzyme/protein, except for their dependence on PCN, also relies on such factors as the mRNA stability, proteolysis and protein folding, and these may vary significantly [ 8 ]. The direct methods include: ( i ) agarose gel electrophoresis followed by densitometry [ 12 , 13 ], ( ii ) capillary electrophoresis [ 14 ], ( iii ) CsCl or ethidium bromide-CsCl gradient centrifugation [ 15 ], ( iv ) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [ 16 ], and techniques based on radiolabelling of the nucleic acids [ 17 ]. All of these techniques are either complicated, time-consuming, have poor reproducibility or can cause safety problems with handling of radioactively labelled probes [ 13 , 18 ]. Therefore, there is a constant need for new and more accurate methods to determine the plasmid copy number.  Development of real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids opened a gate for application of qPCR for PCN determination in bacteria [ 19 ]. To calculate the PCN, two single copy genes: one of the bacterial chromosome (reference gene) and one of a plasmid (target gene) need to be amplified. The calculated copy ratio of the target gene to the reference gene defines the PCN [ 20 ]. Two sensitive and precise calculation methods: absolute and relative, are available for quantification of PCN by qPCR [ 21 ]. However, both calculations rely on the presence of the external standards. Absolute quantification determines the target gene copy number by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification (ΔΔC T method) presents the amount of the target gene in relation to the plasmid (calibrator), where both the target and the reference genes are at a constant ratio of 1:1 [ 20 , 22 ]. In summary, the accuracy of the absolute and relative qPCR quantification, despite such factors as the sample preparation and the choice of a reference gene, largely depends on the quality of the standard [ 19 ], and this is the main drawback of this method.  Recently, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) emerged as a new technology that enables processing of ~20,000 up to 1,000,000 separate PCR reactions in a single tube [ 23 , 24 ]. This method facilitates the accurate and precise quantitation of nucleic acid targets without the need for calibration curves and any external standards [ 23 ]. By using a droplet generator, it is possible to partition a fluorescent-dye based PCR assay into a highly uniform, less than one-nanoliter-volume, water-in-oil droplets. Conventional PCR amplification is then performed in a thermal cycler in 96-well PCR plates. The end-point measurement of the nucleic acid quantity is performed by placing the plate in a ddPCR droplet reader. The reader sips droplets from each well and streams them in a single-file past a two-colour fluorescence detector at the rate of ~1,500 droplets per second. Droplets are annotated as positive or negative based on their fluorescence amplitude, and the number of positive and negative signals is utilized to calculate the concentration of the target DNA with use of Poisson statistics [ 23 , 25 ]. The ddPCR allows to perform either a duplex fluorescent-probe-based PCR assay or, more recently, a single colour fluorescent PCR with the use of a nonspecific DNA binding dye (EvaGreen). The technology based on intercalation of the double-stranded DNA-binding dyes, such as EvaGreen, is simple and inexpensive, and does not need any additional fluorescent-labelled probes [ 26 ]. By differentiating the length of the target and the reference amplicons, it is also possible to distinguish between their fluorescent signals and quantify each of them independently in the same tube.  Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ddPCR technology in determination of the PCN in bacteria. In our report, we used as a model E . coli cells carrying the plasmid pBR322 [ 27 ]. We verified the accuracy of the novel digital methodology by comparing the copy number calculations with the data obtained by real-time PCR. Moreover, we have shown that the DNA extraction method (the commercial total DNA isolation kit vs mechanical cell disruption) can affect the PCN assessment, as well as that this parameter depends on bacterial growth phase and bacterial culture media used. We strongly believe that single colour, droplet digital PCR developed in this study can be used universally for the PCN determination of any plasmid.    Materials and Methods   Strains, plasmids and DNA isolation procedures  E . coli DH5α [pBR322] cells were cultured in ( i ) Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (SIGMA Aldrich), ( ii ) Terrific Broth (TB), comprised of per liter: 12.0 g Tryptone, 24.0 g Yeast Extract, 9.4 g K 2 HPO 4 , 2.2 g KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.2 ± 0.2 at 25°C [ 28 ], ( iii ) M9 minimal medium, comprised of per liter: 6.8 g Na 2 HPO 4 , 3.0 g KH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 g NaCl, 1.0 g NH 4 Cl, 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM thiamine hydrochloride, and 0.2% (w/v) glucose, pH 7.4 [ 29 ] at 37°C with addition of 100 μg/ml of ampicillin (SIGMA Aldrich). At the mid-logarithmic growth phase (OD 600 of 0.5) or stationary growth phase (OD 600 of 1.5, when indicated), 1-ml aliquots were removed from the culture and the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. The total DNA was isolated either with the use of QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIA; Qiagen), following the protocol for bacterial cells (1 h lysis at 56°C), or by the bead-beating (BB) method. For the latter procedure, the Hybaid RiboLyser (Hybaid, Teddington, UK) was used as a mechanical cell disruptor. The Zirconia/Silica (BioSpec Products) 1 mm beads (1.0 g) were placed in a screw-cap 2.0 ml sample tubes and bacteria suspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) were added. Then, the samples were homogenized for 45 s at the 6.5 speed setting and centrifuged (5 min, 20,000 × g). The resulting supernatant, containing the E . coli total DNA, was aliquoted to avoid repeated freezing and thawing of the samples, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at– 70°C for further analysis. The total DNA concentration after isolation with QIAamp DNA Mini Kit was measured using a NanoDrop 1000 UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The template DNA isolated with the use of the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit was normalized to 2 ng μl -1 and samples were stored frozen until further analysis. Vector pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega) was used for molecular cloning. Recombinant plasmid pGEM-dxs that was used as a calibrator, was constructed in this study and is deposited in the Collection of Plasmids and Microorganisms, University of Gdansk, Poland.    Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay conditions  Primers used in the droplet digital PCR were either used previously for bla and dxs qPCR amplification ( Table 1 ; set A) [ 20 ] or designed in this study by using of Primer3Plus programme ( Table 1B ; set B). All primers were purchased form Genomed S.A. (Poland) and were designed to be 20 bp in length and to have the melting temperature within 2.1°C of each other. The usage of the set A primer pairs resulted in PCR product amplification with the length of 81 bp and 113 bp for bla and dxs , respectively. The length of the PCR products for multiplex reaction (primer set B) was design to be 69 bp and 160 bp for bla and dxs , respectively. For each primer pair, a simplex PCR was performed using E . coli DH5α [pBR322] total DNA as a template, followed by electrophoresis in 1.7% agarose gel to confirm the correct size of the product. For all 20 μl ddPCR reaction mixtures assembled, 2× EvaGreen ddPCR Supermix (Bio-Rad) and primers at a final concentration of 0.2 μM were included. No template controls (NTC) were used to monitor contaminations and primer-dimer formation. Reactions were equilibrated for 3 min at room temperature and dispensed into each well of the droplet generator DG8 cartridge (Bio-Rad). Each oil compartment of the cartridge was filled with 70 μl of droplet generation oil for EvaGreen (Bio-Rad), and approximately 20,000 droplets were generated at each well with use of the droplet generator (Bio-Rad QX200). The entire droplet emulsion volume (40 μl) was further loaded onto a 96-well PCR plate (Eppendorf). The plate was then heat sealed with a pierceable foil in the PX1 PCR Plate Sealer (Bio-Rad), and placed in a Mastercycler ep gradient S thermocycler (Eppendorf). The optimal thermal cycling conditions were used: 95°C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min; and a final step at 72°C for 1 min. The reaction mixtures were then held at 4°C until needed. The reactions were optimized with respect to the primer annealing step (in the temperature range between 50 and 62°C) and 58°C has been chosen as the annealing temperature for further analysis (data not shown). The cycled droplets were read individually with the QX200 droplet-reader (Bio-Rad), and analysed with QuantaSoft droplet reader software, version 1.6.6.0320 (Bio-Rad). The error reported for a single well was the Poisson 95% confidence interval.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169846.t001  Table 1  Specification of primers used in this study.

The PCR product (0.58-kb) was digested with HindIII and then ligated into pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega) previously linearized with the same enzyme. The resulting construct (pGEM-dxs), was used to transform E . coli DH5α [ 30 ]. The DNA sequence of the recombinant clone was verified by sequencing. The pGEM-dxs plasmid contains two separate sequences, specific for β-lactamase ( bla ) and dxs target genes. The concentration of the pGEM-dxs was measured using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, with the use of Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen). The theoretical plasmid copy number was calculated with the use of the ENDMEMO software: http://www.endmemo.com/bio/dnacopynum.php . Five 10-fold dilutions of the pGEM-dxs, ranging from 1 × 10 5 to 1 × 10 9 copies μl -1 , were used to construct the standard curves for bla and dxs , respectively. Amplification of the target sequences ( dxs and bla ) was performed using previously published primer sets which are listed in Table 1A (Set A) [ 20 ]. Real-time PCR amplification and analysis were performed using a LightCycler 480 instrument with 1.5.0 software version (Roche Diagnostics). All real-time PCR runs were performed in triplicate, and each reaction mixture was prepared with the use of a LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master kit (Roche Diagnostics). The kit contains PCR-grade H 2 O and 2× concentrated Master mix (the mixture of FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase, reaction buffer, dNTP mix (with dUTP instead of dTTP), SYBR Green I dye, and MgCl 2 ). The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 10 μl containing 3.0 μl of PCR-grade H 2 O, 5 μl of 2× concentrated Master mix, 0.5 μl of each primer (final concentration 0.5 μM), and 1 μl template DNA at specified concentrations indicated.  The following thermal cycling conditions were used: 95°C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 62°C for 10 s, 72°C for 10 s. The fluorescence signal was measured at the end of each extension step at 72°C. After amplification, a melting peak analysis with a temperature gradient of 0.1°C s -1 , from 70 to 95°C, was performed to confirm that only the specific products were amplified. Finally, the samples were cooled down to 40°C for 30 s. Real-time PCR assays were optimized with respect to the MgCl 2 concentration. We found that while no addition of MgCl 2 was required for efficient amplification with use of the bla -primer set, in case of the dxs gene detection it was necessary to supplement the reaction mixture with MgCl 2 to final concentration of 3 mM. Each standard curve was generated by the LightCycler480 SW 1.5 programme. The values of the threshold cycles (C T ) for bla and dxs were determined by the “Fit Points Method” software. The C T values were plotted against the logarithm of a theoretical copy number for each pGEM-dxs template dilution. Standard curves for bla and dxs were generated by a linear regression of the plotted points. For each standard curve, PCR amplification efficiency (E) was calculated by the programme according to the equation: E = 10 −1/slope – 1 (100% efficiency = 1).    Absolute and relative quantification by real-time PCR  Absolute and relative quantification methods were used to quantify the PCN [ 19 , 20 , 22 ]. Both, bla and dxs are single-copy genes of pBR322 and E . coli chromosomal DNA, respectively. Therefore, the plasmid copy number can be determined as the copy ratio of bla to dxs : PCN = [copy number of bla ]/[copy number of dxs ]. Absolute quantification calculates the copy number of bla and dxs genes by relating the PCR signal (C T value) of a sample to the standard curve. A relative quantification presents the amount of the target gene (in our case the bla gene) relative to the dxs gene and to pGEM-dxs, which contains both, the target ( bla ) and the reference ( dxs ) sequences with a constant ratio of 1:1. The target/reference ratios of all samples were normalized by the target/reference ratio of the pGEM-dxs. For the ΔΔC T calculation, the amplification efficiencies (E) of the target and the reference must be approximately equal [ 22 ]. The results are expressed as a fold ratio of the normalized bla gene amounts. The relative amount of bla = (1 + E) – ΔΔCT , where ΔΔC T = ΔC T of the sample (the total DNA extracted from E . coli [pBR322]) − ΔC T of the calibrator (pGEM-dxs); ΔC T = C T of bla − C T of dxs .    Efficiency of chromosomal and plasmid DNA purification with QIAamp DNA mini columns  Chromosomal and plasmid DNA were isolated from E . coli DH5α and E . coli DH5α [pBR322] with the use of Genomic and Plasmid DNA mini kits, respectively (A&A Biotechnology). DNA concentrations were measured by NanoDrop 1000 UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Genomic DNA in the following amounts: 2110 ng, 1855 ng and 3922 ng, were paired with 524 ng, 1100 ng and 1684 ng of plasmid DNA, respectively in three independent experiments. The suspensions of genomic and plasmid DNA were mixed separately with 100 μl of a lysis buffer (Qiagen). DNA isolations were performed using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit following manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). Concentration of the eluted DNA was measured by ND-1000 Spectrophotometer and the ratio of the recovered to loaded DNA was calculated.    Statistical analysis  The statistical significance was assessed by the two tailed Student unpaired t test with use of GraphPad Prism 5.0 software with a P value <0.05 (95% confidence interval).     Results   PCN determination by droplet digital PCR  Droplet digital PCR is a novel technology that provides an absolute quantification of the target DNA with high precision, accuracy, and sensitivity. The DNA templates were isolated either with the QIAamp DNA mini kit or by the bead-beating method and diluted as presented on S1 Fig . Primer pairs used for bla and dxs amplification are listed in Table 1 (set A). Each measurement was done in two replicates (named bla1, bla2 and dxs1, dxs2; see Fig 1 ). The template DNA was obtained from two independent E . coli DH5α [pBR322] cultures (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2). The concentrations (copies/μl) of bla and dxs of total DNA isolated either with the QIAamp DNA mini kit or by the bead-beating method are shown on Fig 1A and 1B , respectively. The error reported for a single well was the Poisson 95% confidence interval. Representative 1D droplet plots show well defined clusters of bla and dxs positive droplets (blue colour) and cluster of droplets with no DNA (grey colour) ( Fig 1C ). Each droplet in the emulsion represents an independent nano-PCR. The threshold for positive and negative droplets and the concentrations of bla and dxs has been established automatically by the QuantaSoft droplet reader software. No primer-dimers were detected. The plasmid copy number is calculated by dividing the concentration of bla (copies μl -1 ) by dxs (copies μl -1 ). The plasmid copy numbers are presented on Fig 1D . The values for pBR322 vary between 19.85 and 21.73 copies per chromosome for the total DNA template isolated by the QIAamp DNA plasmid mini kit (average of 20.5), and between 6.92 and 7.49 copies per chromosome for the total DNA isolated by the bead-beating method (average of 7.3).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169846.g001  Fig 1   Quantification of pBR322 plasmid copy number by digital droplet PCR.  E . coli DH5α total DNA isolated by the bead beating method (A) and the QIAamp DNA mini kit (B), from two independent bacterial cultures in a logarithmic growth phase (Experiment 1 and 2), served as a template for the bla and dxs ddPCR amplification with the use of primer set A ( Table 1A ). Each experiment was run in two replicates (bla1, bla2 and dxs1, dxs2). Error bars indicate the 95% confidence limits as determined from the Poisson distribution.

Average PCN from four measurements was determined to be 20.5 for QIA and 7.3 for the bead-beating method.       Single colour, multiplex droplet digital PCR  The EvaGreen fluorescence is influenced by differences in the size of the amplicons [ 31 ]. The fluorescence amplitude of positive droplets increases with the amplicon length, as multiple dye molecules bind the same PCR product. Variation in the fluorescence signal intensity of EvaGreen, due to the size of DNA present in each droplet, was utilized for multiplexed detection. Optimal, 0.2 μM concentration of primers was also used, as primers concentration may influence the amplitude of droplets in EvaGreen based ddPCR [ 31 ]. We designed two pairs of primers which resulted in amplification of 69 bp and 160 bp DNA fragments for bla and dxs , respectively ( Table 1B ). Following amplification in the EvaGreen-containing reaction mixtures, positive droplets encapsulating the 160-bp DNA fragment ( dxs ) had higher fluorescence amplitude than those obtained for bla ( Fig 2A ). The 2D droplet plot revealed four different clusters of droplets: with no DNA (grey), bla positive (blue), dxs positive (green) and a small fraction of double positive droplets (orange) ( Fig 2B ). Manual thresholds were drawn to assign those clusters, but this factor did not significantly affect the results of the calculated DNA concentration. In parallel, we verified the presence of the two correctly sized PCR products by electrophoresis in a 1.7% agarose gel ( Fig 2C ). The table presented in Fig 2D shows the calculated plasmid copy number for each reaction carried in separate tubes (tubes no. 2 and 3) and for a multiplexed reaction (tube no. 1). This experiment was repeated with a DNA material isolated from an independent E . coli DH5α [pBR322] culture. The results indicated 247 copies μl -1 of bla and 36.6 copies μl -1 of dxs , which gave 6.7 copies of pBR322 for the BB DNA template isolation. Subsequently, for the QIAamp DNA mini kit template DNA extraction, we obtained 242 copies μl -1 of bla and 12 copies μl-1 of dxs which resulted in 20.17 copies of pBR322.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169846.g002  Fig 2   Quantification of pBR322 plasmid copy number with a single colour, multiplex, digital droplet PCR.

(D) Estimated pBR322 copy number by multiplex (tube no. 1) and single (tubes no. 2 and 3) droplet digital PCR. The plasmid copy number of pBR322 (PCN) was calculated by dividing the copy number of bla by the copy number of dxs .       Validation of droplet digital PCR method by real-time PCR  To validate the droplet digital PCR methodology, we used real-time PCR as it became a "gold standard" in plasmid copy number determination. Total DNA was isolated from E . coli DH5α [pBR322] using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The chosen strain’s genetic background was endA ˉ because the presence of endonuclease A may negatively influence the quality of isolated DNA [ 32 ]. Non-optimized standard curves for bla and dxs are shown in S2 Fig . Both standard curves were linear, with average slopes of −3.32 and −3.54 for bla and dxs genes, respectively. Based on the standard curve slopes, amplification efficiencies of 1.0 and 0.92 were calculated for bla and dxs , respectively ( S2 Fig ). Because of differences in amplification efficiencies, the real-time PCR optimization was required. Different approaches, like supplementation of PCR reaction with organic compounds or genetic recombination proteins, have been used to improve the PCR efficiency and specificity [ 33 , 34 ]. In our hands, we found that supplementation of a qPCR mixture with MgCl 2 (3 mM) caused an increase in dxs amplification efficiency to E = 1.0 ( Fig 3A ). The experimentally defined C T values correlated with the template dilutions. The fit of the model was satisfactory; the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was 0.999 for the triplicate reaction. A sensitive method for assessing if two amplicons have the same efficiency is to look at how ΔC T varies with template dilution. Each of the 10-fold dilutions of a calibrator (pGEM-dxs) served as a template for amplification of bla and dxs genes in separate reactions. For three reaction replicates, the average C T was calculated for both, bla and dxs , and the ΔC T (C T  bla − C T  dxs ) was determined. The plot in Fig 3B represents the log pGEM-dxs template dilution versus ΔC T . The slope of the lane is 0.0228 which proves that the efficiencies of the target and reference genes are similar, and the ΔΔC T calculation for the relative quantification of bla may be used. Real time PCR amplifications of the bla and dxs genes from the total DNA isolated from three separate cultures of E . coli DH5α [pBR322] were performed simultaneously. The total DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). For absolute quantification, standard curves were generated with pGEM-dxs calibrator containing one copy of the dxs and bla specific sequences. The C T values of each curve served for calculation of the absolute copy number of bla and dxs in the E . coli total DNA samples. The plasmid copy number of pBR322 was calculated by dividing the copy number of bla by the copy number of dxs . The total DNA samples from three independent cultures indicated similar plasmid copy numbers of 20.2, 22.7 and 21.7 ( Table 2A ). For relative quantification, the ΔC T of the pGEM-dxs was given as 0.57 ± 0.07 by averaging the ΔC T values determined from the 10-fold dilution series ( Fig 3B and Table 2B ). Because the amplification efficiency of both, bla and dxs , was 1.0, the plasmid copy number was determined by the 2 −ΔΔCT equation. The results obtained from three independent total DNA samples were 20.7, 23.4 and 22.5 copies per chromosome. Moreover, 10 fold dilution of the total DNA template at concentration of 0.2 ng/μl gave a similar pBR322 copy number to what was obtained for the undiluted sample: 20.2 vs 20.0 and 20.7 vs 20.3 for absolute and relative quantification, respectively ( Table 2A and 2B , culture 1).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169846.g003  Fig 3   Construction of the standard curves for bla and dxs .  (A) The standard curves were calculated with serial 10-fold dilutions of pGEM-dxs, ranging from 1 × 10 5 to 1 × 10 9 copies μl -1 . Each standard dilution was amplified by qPCR using bla and dxs primer sets ( n = 2). For each gene, the determined C T values were plotted against the logarithm of their known initial copy number. A standard curve was generated by linear regression through these points. (B) Validation of the ΔΔC T calculation. The ΔC T deviation of bla vs. dxs was calculated for each dilution and plotted ( n = 2).

The effect of DNA isolation method on plasmid copy number determination  The accuracy of PCN determination strongly relies on the precise ratio of chromosomal DNA to plasmid DNA [ 35 – 37 ]. Therefore, for the total DNA isolation from bacterial cells we decided to use a mechanical cell disruptor based on the bead-beating technology. A recent report on the comparative analysis of DNA extraction methods has shown a significant superiority of the mechanical cell disruption over other lysis procedures [ 38 ]. The method is based on disruption of cells by zirconia beads added to the suspension of cells. For plasmid copy number determination, 10-fold dilutions of the DNA template were used. The results of absolute quantification are shown in Table 3 . The total DNA samples of pBR322 from three independent cultures, at logarithmic growth phase, showed similar plasmid copy numbers of 6.6, 6.9 and 7.2. However, these numbers were significantly lower than those calculated for DNA templates isolated by the QIAamp DNA mini kit. It is commonly known that the extraction protocols may suffer from inadequacies, including DNA retention on the mini column surfaces [ 39 ]. Therefore, we assessed the efficiency of chromosomal and plasmid DNA purification by the QIAamp DNA mini kit. Chromosomal and plasmid DNA, each at a known amount, were mixed separately with the lysis buffer and loaded onto the QIAamp DNA mini columns. The DNA recovery was calculated as percentage of the eluted DNA compared to the load. The result obtained showed that only 45.4% to 48.7% of the initial amount of E . coli chromosomal DNA was present in the eluate. The same applied to the plasmid DNA, where 81.37% to 92.27% of DNA was recovered ( Fig 4 ). The statistical significance was marked by the asterisk on Fig 4 , with P <0.02; Student t test.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169846.g004  Fig 4   Efficiency of genomic and plasmid DNA recovery with the QIAamp DNA mini kit columns.  Genomic and plasmid DNA were isolated from E . coli DH5α and E . coli DH5α [pBR322] with the use of Genomic and Plasmid DNA mini kits, respectively (A&A Biotechnology). DNA concentrations were measured by NanoDrop 1000 UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Genomic DNA in the following amounts: 2110 ng, 1855 ng and 3922 ng, was coupled with 524 ng, 1100 ng and 1684 ng of plasmid DNA, respectively. Then, 100 μl of the lysis buffer (Qiagen) was added separately to genomic and plasmid DNA and the nucleic acids isolation was performed according to the QIAamp DNA mini kit manufacturer’s manual. The level of isolated DNA is indicated as a percentage relative to the unprocessed sample. The diagram represents three independent experiments.

Because, the plasmid copy number changes in response to bacterial growth phase [ 40 ] and the culture medium employed [ 41 ], we cultivated bacteria in three different culture media: Luria-Bertani, Terrific broth and M9 minimal medium. The total DNA was isolated form E . coli DH5α cells by the bead-beating method. The plasmid copy number also varies in response to bacterial growth phase [ 40 ], therefore we isolated total DNA from bacteria in mid-logarithmic and stationary growth phase (LB, OD 600 = 0.5 and OD 600 = 1.5, respectively). The results obtained are shown in Table 3 (absolute quantification). The pBR322 copy number in LB when compared to terrific broth are similar (average 6.9 vs 6.4; P = 0.0651), and higher in bacterial stationary growth phase (6.9 vs 14.5; P <0.0001), as well as in the M9 minimal medium (6.9 vs 13.1; P <0.0001). These differences might be explained by the mechanism of plasmid DNA replication in E . coli DH5α during amino acid starvation (which is the case in stationary growth phase and during bacterial growth in M9 minimal medium). In the initiation process of E . coli plasmid DNA replication, a persistent hybrid is formed between the DNA template and the preprimer RNA II. The hybrid is necessary for subsequent primer generation that is elongated by the DNA polymerase I. On the other hand, the hybrid formation between RNA II and the DNA template might be blocked by the antisense RNA I molecule and in consequence no replication occurs. During amino acid starvation large amount of uncharged tRNA molecules are present in the bacterial cell. Uncharged tRNAs are able to bind both the RNA I or RNA II what prevents their interaction, but do not block the primer formation. Therefore, the uncharged tRNA abolishes the inhibitory role of RNA I and promotes the initiation of plasmid DNA replication what results in higher PCN in bacterial cells starved for amino acids [ 42 ]. The relative quantification calculations are shown in S1 Table and precisely reflect the absolute measurements.     Discussion  To produce recombinant proteins or non-proteinous recombinant products appropriate expression system needs to be chosen. Among different parameters describing expression vectors, such as structural and segregational plasmid stability, plasmid copy number is an essential feature with strong impact on system productivity. In the present study, we developed a method for plasmid copy determination based on droplet digital PCR and EvaGreen, a next-generation DNA binding dye. This method is compatible with an approach that calculates the PCN parameter as a number of plasmid copies per chromosome [ 8 ]. However, there is also an alternative approach that estimates the PCN as a number of plasmid copies per cell [ 43 ]. It is important to stress that the results obtained with both approaches can differ. In the case of pBR322 present in fast growing bacteria (log phase), the number of plasmids per cell was calculated to be 39–55. However, in a parallel experiment the plasmid copy number per chromosome in the same phase of growth was estimated as 15–32 [ 44 ]. From those experiments it can be concluded that the average number of plasmid copies per cell is always higher than that calculated per chromosome. This phenomenon can be explained by multiple openings of the replication forks during bacterial exponential phase of growth that lead to the decrease of the plasmid per chromosome ratio and in consequence lower the plasmid copy number [ 18 , 45 ]. Therefore, in the literature, depending on the methodology used, two different ranges of the pBR322 copy number exist: 15–20 [ 20 ] and 30–70 [ 46 ], and our results correspond to the lower PCN ranges. Apart from the different PCN calculation strategies (per chromosome or per cell), another source of variations in the PCN determination is the method used for DNA purification [ 37 ]. Real-time PCR requires only a small amount of the template DNA, but different efficiencies in the total DNA isolations can lead to the PCN miscalculation. Indeed, the most commonly used method for qPCR template purification is DNA isolation with the use of commercial kits or multi-step procedures involving cell disruption, often with the use of lysozyme, enzymatic protein digestion, DNA extraction with phenol-chloroform, precipitation and rehydratation [ 13 , 20 , 43 ]. However, it is already known that each step added to the DNA purification procedure increases the probability of the sample loss [ 37 ]. Therefore, for efficient DNA isolation, we replaced the multi-step DNA isolation procedure by a simple, mechanical disruption of bacterial cells by the bead-beating method. In our hands, the bead-beating seemed to be a simple and fast strategy to isolate total DNA that was ready to be used in the qPCR experiments. In recent years, the bead-beating method was successfully used for efficient DNA isolation for various applications [ 47 – 49 ]. For example, among five different mechanical cell disruption methods, including sonication, nebulization, homogenization, microfluidization, and bead milling (bead-beating; BB in this paper), the bead milling was found to be the most efficient for intact plasmid extraction from bacterial cells, with the recovery yield reaching over 90% [ 47 ]. Moreover, it was shown that only bead-beating was effective for isolating DNA from such difficult samples as Bacillus globigii ( B . subtilis subsp. niger ) endospores or Fusarium moniliforme conidia [ 48 ]. In our hands, two different methods used for DNA isolation gave two different ranges of the pBR322 copy number (Tables 2 and 3 and S1 Table ). For the E . coli bacteria in the log-phase, the pBR322 PCN was in a range of 6–7 for the bead-beating method, and 20–23 for the QIAamp DNA Mini kit used for DNA isolation. It is a common knowledge that there is a difference in efficiency of isolation of plasmid or chromosomal DNA, especially when the DNA binding columns are used. We have shown that in defined experimental settings, when mixture of genomic and plasmid DNA was loaded onto a purification column, on average only 46.54% of the initial amount of E . coli chromosomal DNA was present in the eluate. The same applied to as much as 87.38% of the plasmid DNA ( Fig 4 ). This difference may distort the ratio of the plasmid to chromosomal DNA and lead to over-estimation of the plasmid copy number. Problems with the multi-step DNA isolation procedures were also noticed by other scientists [ 18 , 37 , 43 ]. In many laboratories, the researchers had started to prepare DNA for the PCN determination by heating the cell samples at 95°C [ 43 ], and different heating protocols were tested for an optimal template preparation [ 18 , 37 ]. In our project, we performed the direct comparison between a multi-step procedure and a simple, mechanical cells disruption method for DNA extraction. Similar analyses had not been performed by others so far.  Besides using different DNA isolation methods to calculate the pBR322 copy number, we successfully applied DNA endogenous controls independent, droplet digital PCR technology to evaluate the obtained results. The ddPCR methodology does not rely on the use of standard curves for absolute quantification of nucleic acids. The ddPCR is also less susceptible to PCR inhibitors often co-extracted with nucleic acids from environmental samples and shows better reproducibility at low target concentrations than qPCR [ 37 , 50 ]. Moreover, the method demonstrates improved detection of low copy number DNA target, because the large-scale partitioning involved with ddPCR removes the potential competition with extraneous DNA targets for primers or other reagents [ 23 ]. Droplet digital PCR has been used before to calculate the plasmid copy number of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 plasmid pA-EGFP_B [ 37 ] or a set of six certified reference plasmid solutions (ERM-AD623a–f) from the Joint Research Centre-Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (JRC-IRMM, European Commission, Belgium) [ 51 ]. However, in both cases specific, dual colour, oligonucleotide probe dependent ddPCR was performed. Oligonucleotide probe dependent ddPCR technique requires optimization of the particular reaction and the optimized reaction cannot be adapted to evaluate copy number of unrelated plasmid. In contrast to oligonucleotide probe dependent ddPCR, the EvaGreen single colour ddPCR designed in this study can be more widely used. Obtained ddPCR results fully confirmed the absolute and relative qPCR calculations. With the use of ddPCR, we also observed the same dependency of PCN on the total DNA isolation method used. Moreover, we show a possibility of performing the detection of both, the target ( bla ) and the reference ( dxs ) genes, in a single tube by differentiating the amplicon length ( Fig 2 ). ddPCR is a simple, straightforward method for PCN calculation. It allows performing thousands of PCR reactions in a single tube which significantly increases the precision of PCN calculations. Therefore, we propose ddPCR as the preferred method of choice for determination of plasmid copy number.    Conclusions  To our knowledge, for the first time, we applied a single colour ddPCR (with the use of EvaGreen) for determination of the plasmid copy number. Because, the β-lactamase is a common selection marker present in many expression systems, and E . coli is a popular bacterial host, we believe that ddPCR method developed in this study can be easily adopted by other researches to evaluate plasmid copy number. Moreover, with a little effort the designed method can be optimized to be used for other selection markers (such as genes encoding resistance to chloramphenicol or tetracycline) and different bacterial hosts.

Boswellia sacra (Burseraceae), a keystone endemic species, is famous for the production of fragrant oleo-gum resin. However, the genetic make-up especially the genomic information about chloroplast is still unknown. Here, we described for the first time the chloroplast (cp) genome of B . sacra . The complete cp sequence revealed a circular genome of 160,543 bp size with 37.61% GC content. The cp genome is a typical quadripartite chloroplast structure with inverted repeats (IRs 26,763 bp) separated by small single copy (SSC; 18,962 bp) and large single copy (LSC; 88,055 bp) regions. De novo assembly and annotation showed the presence of 114 unique genes with 83 protein-coding regions. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the B . sacra cp genome is closely related to the cp genome of Azadirachta indica and Citrus sinensis , while most of the syntenic differences were found in the non-coding regions. The pairwise distance among 76 shared genes of B . sacra and A . indica was highest for atpA , rpl2 , rps12 and ycf1 . The cp genome of B . sacra reveals a novel genome, which could be used for further studied to understand its diversity, taxonomy and phylogeny.

KT934315.    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.g005   Introduction  A major distinguishing organelle of plant cells is the chloroplast, which was suggested to have originated from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis [ 1 – 3 ]. The main role and function of the chloroplast is to perform photosynthesis and generate the building blocks required for plant growth and development [ 4 , 5 ]. Chloroplasts also participate in the biosynthesis of starch, fatty acids, pigments and amino acids [ 6 ]. Until recently, approximately 490 complete chloroplast (cp) genomes have been sequenced, and this information is publicly available ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ genome). Most of these assembled genomes are associated with economically important crop plants [ 7 ]. Chloroplast genome analysis and engineering, either alone or in combination with traditional breeding techniques, might provide information for the future development of novel plant sources to counteract various environmental stress tolerance issues and improve the level of human-derived benefits from the target plant [ 8 ]. The techniques might also provide information to improve the current understanding of major biosynthesis pathways and functions. The chloroplast (cp) genome contains important information in plant systematics and is maternally inherited in most angiosperms [ 9 ]. Thus, understanding these highly conserved structures could also reveal vital features for designing genetic markers.  Chloroplasts contain circular DNA with nearly 130 genes ranging in size from 72–217 kb [ 10 – 11 ]. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is remarkably conserved in gene content and structure, envisaging important information for genome-wide studies of plant evolution [ 12 ]. Recent studies, using advanced genome sequencing techniques, have improved the prospects for resolving phylogenetic homogeneity at taxonomic levels and have enhanced the current understanding of the structural and functional evolution of economically important plants and their traits [ 12 – 15 ]. In the last decade, numerous studies have reported the results of chloroplast genome sequencing for economically and ecologically important tree species, such as Eucommia ulmoides [ 16 ], Poplus cathayana [ 17 ], Quercus spinosa [ 18 ], Acacia ligulata [ 19 ], Pinus armandii [ 20 ], Cocos nucifera [ 21 ], Citrus aurantiifolia [ 22 ], Musa acuminata [ 23 ], Norway spruce [ 24 ], etc. The elucidation of the chloroplast genomes of important tree species has facilitated to understand the evaluation of gene structure and has targeted conservation and propagation strategies [ 12 – 13 ].  To understand the genome structure of chloroplasts, we have investigated the economically and culturally important frankincense-producing tree ( Boswellia sacra ; Burseraceae) [ 25 ]. There are approximately twenty Boswellia species, and B . sacra is an endemic species growing only in Dhofar region of Oman [ 25 – 26 ]. The trees grow in desert-woodlands ( Fig 1 ) with meager amounts of water and nutrient availability [ 27 ], whereas the domesticated trees are supplied with water [ 28 ]. In response to the incisions by the local people, the tree activates its defense mechanism by producing resin [ 28 ]. The crystalline resin is used to create a fragrant smoke in homes and also sold in the market for income [ 26 – 27 ]. In addition to this, the tree has received much attention because of its medicinal uses in the Arabian region [ 29 ]. The essential oil and the boswellic acid or its derivatives possesses potent anticancer activities [ 30 – 32 ]. There is very scarce scientific knowledge exists regarding the genetic make-up and physiological functions of this endemic tree. Previously, Coppi et al. [ 31 ] has worked on the genetic diversity of B . sacra using ITS and ISSR analysis, where detailed genomic and conservation studies were suggested. Therefore, it is high time to further understand this keystone species. Hence, in the current study it was aimed to elucidate the complete chloroplast genome of B . sacra and determine the phylogenetic relationship of this tree with related species.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.g001  Fig 1   Boswellia sacra –habitat and leaf morphology.  This tree grows wildly in the Dhofar region of Oman.       Materials and Methods   Ethics statement  The study site was managed by the Museum of the Frankincense Land (Salalah). The samples were collected from the Natural Park of Frankincense Tree, which is part of the Land of Frankincense sites, inscribed in the UNESCO’s World Cultural and Natural Heritage List. A permission was obtained from the Museum of the Frankincense Land to use the leaf part of the tree resources for research purposes. The trees used for sampling were treated ethically, and our study did not harm the local environment.    Site description and plant growth conditions  Wadi Dawkah, Dhofar-Oman (17°25ʹ21ʹʹN; 54°00ʹ32ʹʹE) is a completely arid desert region with small sandstone hills. The annual mean temperature of the sampling area is ~35°C, and the annual rainfall is approximately 40 mm [ 22 ]. The temperature in summer reaches to ~48°C. Leaf samples were collected from healthy trees with the least number of incisions/wounds, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen during the field trip to Wadi Dawkah and subsequently stored at -80°C until further analysis. The plant samples were collected by the first author in July 2015, which were identified by Plant Taxonomist Mohammed Al-Broumi, University of Nizwa. The specimens were deposited at University of Nizwa Herbarium Center with a voucher number (UC29).    Chloroplast DNA extraction, sequencing and assembly  The fresh leaves from Boswellia sacra were washed with sterile distilled water to remove sand particles and soil debris. The chloroplast DNA was extracted by using a modified protocol of Shi et al. [ 33 ]. To prepare the sequencing library, 300 ng of extracted DNA was sheared to 400-bp by using the BioRuptor UCD-200 TS Sonication System (Diagenode Co., Belgium and Denville, NJ, USA). The fragmented DNA was used for subsequent library preparation using the Ion Xpress Fragment Library Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DNA library was diluted to 4 pM, and emulsion PCR was performed using the Ion OneTouch System 2 (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The final sequencing library was loaded onto an Ion 316 v2 chip and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM for 850 flows using the Ion PGM Sequencing 400 Kit (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). The resultant sequence was de novo assembled and mapped with the reference genome [ 34 ]. The gaps identified were filled through another round of cp DNA extraction and sequencing. Following aforementioned procedures of cp DNA extraction, a second library was also prepared and sequenced separately to increase the raw data. The filtered sequence reads were assembled and aligned to the known cp genome sequences of Sapindales. At first, the filtered reads were de novo assembled into contigs using Mimicking Intelligent Read Assembly (MIRA 4.0) [ 35 ]. Second, the assembled contigs were mapped against the reference Azadirachta indica (accession number: NC 023792) through Map Reads to Reference Tool in CLC Genomics Workbench (version 8.5). The order of contigs was resolute according to the reference genomes. The gaps (7 to 150 bp) between the de novo contigs were replaced with consensus sequences of raw reads, which were later, re-mapped to the reference genomes. Any additional gaps were either filled manually by mapping tools in CLC Genomics Workbench (version 8.5) or using GapCloser ( http://soap.genomics.org.cn/index.html ).    Chloroplast gene annotation and sequence analyses  Genome annotation was performed by using Dual Organellar GenoMe Annotator (DOGMA) [ 36 ], tRNAscan-SE v.1.21 [ 37 ] and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [ 38 ] from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The using MAUVE v2.4.0 software [ 39 ] was used to compare the genes and sequences of the de novo assembled B . sacra cp genome sequence and Azadirachta indica cp genome sequence, as a reference. In addition, full alignments with annotations were visualized using the VISTA viewer [ 40 ].    Repeat sequence analysis  MISA ( http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/ ) was used to analyze the types and positions of various simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in B . sacra . The results of this analysis were also correlated with the reference cp genome of A . indica according to the methods of Su et al. [ 22 ], where a minimum number of repeats were set at 10, 5, 4, 3, 3, and 3 for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotides. For long repeats, the REPuter program [ 41 ] was used to identify the number and location of direct and inverted repeats. Minimums repeat size of 30 bp and sequence identity greater than 90% were used. Tandem repeats in the B . sacra cp genome were identified using Tandem Repeats Finder version 4.07 b [ 42 ] with the default settings.  Complete cp genomes as well as a separate partition using only 76 shared genes were employed to analyze the average pairwise sequence divergence for B . sacra and Azadirachta indica . Missing and ambiguous gene annotations were confirmed by comparative sequence analysis after a multiple sequence alignment and gene order comparison [ 43 ]. These regions were aligned using MAFFT (version 7.222) [ 44 ] with the default parameters. Kimura’s two-parameter (K2P) model was selected to calculate pairwise sequence divergences [ 45 ]. The indel (insertion and deletion) polymorphism of shared genes were calculated using DnaSP 5.10.01 [ 46 ]. A custom Python script ( https://www.biostars.org/p/119214/ ) based on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) definition (a variation in a single nucleotide that occurs at a specific position in the genome) was employed to call SNPs. In addition, the SNPs in coding regions were classified in two ways: synonymous and nonsynonymous as shown by Guo et al. [ 47 ]. The number of synonymous (S) and nonsynonymous (N) substitutions for the B . sacra and Azadirachta indica was performed on MEGA 7.0 [ 48 ].    Phylogenetic analysis  Phylogenetic analysis of the Boswellia sacra cp genome was performed using Create Alignment and Create Tree tools in CLC genomics workbench version 8.5 (Gap open cost = 10.0, Gap extension cost = 1.0, Tree construction method = Neighbor Joining, Nucleotide distance measure = Jukes-Cantor) [ 49 ]. A total of 32 Malvidae species were selected as in-groups, whereas Vitis venifera was used as an outgroup. The accession numbers are provided in S1 Table . Complete cp genomes were used, and the bootstrap supports were estimated from 100 re-sampled alignments. Four methods were employed to construct phylogenetic trees from 32 cp genomes, including Bayesian inference (BI) implemented with MrBayes 3.12 [ 50 ], maximum parsimony (MP) with PAUP 4.0 [ 51 ], and maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), posterior probabilities (PP) and neighbor-joining (NJ) with MEGA 7 [ 48 ].     Results and Discussion   General features of the Boswellia sacra chloroplast genome  Genome sequencing and assembly of Ion Torrent PGM sequencing produced 286.8 Mb of data for chloroplast genome of Boswellia sacra . A total of 373,248 reads (or 112,936,195 bp) were de novo assembled showing at total of 703x cp genome coverage. The chloroplast genome sequence quality was re-confirmed through repeating library preparation and sequencing of the extracted cpDNA from B . sacra tree. This result was sufficient to produce a single consensus sequence representing the complete chloroplast genome of Boswellia sacra . The de novo assembled genome was referenced with already reported cp genomes of Sapindales such as Citrus sinensis and Azadirachta indica . The gaps between the de novo contigs were replaced with consensus sequences of the raw reads and re-mapped to the reference genome. The sequences of the chloroplast genomes were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: KT934315).  The complete chloroplast genome was 160,543 bp in size, comprising a large single copy (LSC) region of 88,055 bp and a small single copy (SSC) region of 18,962 bp. In addition, a pair of inverted repeats (IRa and IRb) of 26,763 bp each ( Fig 2 ) was also revealed. The annotation analysis revealed 114 different genes, with 83 protein-coding genes. The number of tRNA and rRNA genes was 27 and 4, respectively ( Table 1 ). Among these, 24 genes were duplicated in the IR regions. The cp genome size of B . sacra was almost similar to Azadirachta indica (160,737 bp) and Citrus sinensis (160,129 bp). However, the size was almost 380 bp higher than closer relative in Order Sapindales i.e. Citrus aurantifolia (159,893 bp). In case of other arid-land trees, B . sacra size was higher than Acacia ligulata (158,724 bp) as shown in the previous studies of cp genomes of these plants [ 19 , 22 , 52 ]. This structure is consistent with the results of previous restriction mapping study [ 53 ], although the total lengths slightly differed.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.g002  Fig 2   Gene map of the Boswellia sacra chloroplast genome.  A pair of thick lines in the inside circle represents the inverted repeats (IRa and IRb; 26,763 bp each), separating the large single copy region (LSC; 88,055 bp) from the small single copy region (SSC; 18962 bp). The genes drawn inside the circle are transcribed clockwise, while those drawn outside the circle are transcribed counterclockwise.      10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.t001  Table 1  Summary of the chloroplast genome characteristics in Boswellia sacra and Azadirachta indica .

Most of the essential photosynthesis-related genes were identified in the cp genome ( Table 2 ; S2 Table ). Twenty genes related to photosystem I and II, seventeen genes related to ATP synthase NADH dehydrogenase, six genes associated with the cytochrome b/f complex, a large subunit rbcL , two ORF, and other important genes related to ATP-dependent protease/ATP binding subunit ( clpP ), translational initiation factor ( infA ), Maturase K ( matK ), envelope membrane protein ( cemA ), subunit of acetyl-Co-Acarboxylase ( accD ), and c-type cytochrome synthesis gene ( ccsA ) were identified during annotation. The existence of chloroplast-encoded clpP in B . sacra suggested that this gene is indispensable for cell survival. Though this needs further verifications, but the presence of clpP indicates a better system to combat severe heat and drought stress in B . sacra , whereas Cicer arietinum , Lathyrus sativus , and Pisum sativum have lost an intron in both clpP1 and rps12 [ 54 ]. The clpP gene has also been identified in Acacia ligulata [ 19 ], Trifolium subterraneum [ 55 ], Camellia sp. [ 56 ], Actinidiaceae [ 57 ] and Wollemia nobilis [ 58 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.t002  Table 2  List of Genes found in cp genome of Boswellia sacra .

The results showed a high level of similarity in the overall composition of the two cp genomes. The B . sacra cp genome had approximately 37.61% GC content, which is higher than that of A . indica (37.5%). In the B . sacra cp genome, the intergenic regions, introns, and genic regions account for ca. 33.5%, 9.6%, and 57.5%, respectively, as shown in Tables 1 & 2 . The pairwise alignment of these two cp genomes revealed approximately 9.52% sequence divergence ( Table 3 ; S3 Table ; S4 Table ; S5 Table ) comprising 8,929 substitutions (5.56%) and 3,971 Indels (3.96%). The sizes of the LSC and SSC regions were somehow different between these two cp genomes, primarily reflecting the large index in each region. The 10 most divergent intergenic regions included the spacer between trnH—GUG-psbA (457 bp, 40.54% divergence), accD—psaI (746 bp, 37.27% divergence), atpH—atpI (1,167 bp, 33.94% divergence), psbZ—trnG-UCC (546 bp, 28.14% divergence), trnK—UUU-rps16 (1,034 bp, 26.40% divergence), petN—psbM (1,139 bp, 36.21% divergence), ycf4—cemA (942 bp, 26.69% divergence), ccsA—ndhD (307 bp, 25.24% divergence), trnR-UCU—atpA (198 bp, 28.97% divergence) and trnL-UAG—ccsA (111 bp, 33.05% divergence). These findings suggest that a deletion might have occurred in this region in A . indica after the divergence of A . indica and B . sacra .   10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.t003  Table 3  Differences between the B . sacra and A . indica cp genomes.

In case of indels , the cp genome of B . sacra was highly conserved, however, in total 25 loci were identified with most variable regions. ycf1 was highly variable region showing a 4354 indel sites, followed by atpA with 124 indel sites. The average indel length for ycf1 was 174 bp, followed by rpl14 with deletion of 25.5 bp. On the other hand, the indel diversity per site was highest for rpl2 ( S6 Table ). We also compared the cp genomes of B . sacra and A . indica and calculated the average pairwise sequence divergence among 76 shared genes ( S7 Table ). Of these, the B . sacra genome has 0.066 average sequence divergence. Furthermore, among the genes identified to show highest level of divergence were atpA , rpl2 , rps12 , ycf1 , infA , rpl22 , rpl32 , rpl20 , ndhF and rps8 ( S3 Fig ). The highest average sequence distance was found for atpA (0.852), followed by rps11 (0.301).  The trnH/psbA intergenic region has been studied as a barcode of differentiation at the species level in the plastids of inland plants, such as Araucaria [ 57 – 59 ]. This region, highly variable in length and sequence, is an on-coding region flanked by two conserved coding regions, i.e., psbA , which encodes photosystem II protein D1, and trnH-GUG , which functions in histidine translation [ 12 – 13 ]. The results revealed a 457 bp sequence trnH / psbA intergenic region in B . sacra . Yap et al. [ 57 ] suggested that this sequence was not present in Agathis dammara compared with Wollemia nobili . Previous detailed BLAST analyses have shown that this Indel is present in nineteen Araucaria species, including W . nobili [ 57 ]. In addition, psbA protects photosystem II from oxidative stress developed through drought. A previous report of Huo et al. [ 60 ] demonstrated that the overexpression of the psbA gene improves drought tolerance in tobacco plant. The occurrence of psbA in B . sacra suggests a strong ability to counteract oxidative stress, as this tree frequently encounters low-water conditions, however, this still needs further in-depth investigations.    Synteny between B . sacra and A . indica  A syntenic structure was also visualized in the MAUVE alignment for both cp genomes as shown in S1 Fig . The MAUVE alignment showed that there are two locally collinear blocks (LCBs) in the chloroplast genomes of B . sacra and A . indica . These regions showed homology in genome organization between the two species, although the sequences are inverted relative to each other. The LCBs of protein coding, tRNA, and rRNA genes showed a similar synteny for both cp genomes. Similarly, the two cp genomes were run global alignment through VISTA to understand the comparative genomic organization [ 40 ]. The results of the alignment showed that both are having high sequence similarity. However, the marked differences were observed between the non-coding regions ( petN and psbM ; accD and psal ; ycf4 and cemA ; rpl32 and trnL ; atpH and atpl ). The most divergent in coding regions were trnl , matK , clpP , rpl33 , accD , rps3 , ndh (A , H , D and G) , ycf3 and ycf1 ( Fig 3 ). Leliaert and Lopez-Bautista [ 61 ] revealed a similar homogenous matrix in cp genome sequencing between Bryopsis plumosa and Tydemania expeditions . However, dissimilarity in the synteny of some fragments of both cp genomes was observed, and this high dissimilarity is not unexpected, as high erraticism in the architecture of cpDNA has been observed among various species of congeneric taxa, such as picoplanktonic species, and Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae [ 62 – 63 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.g003  Fig 3   Visualization alignment of chloroplast genome sequences of B . sacra and A . indica .

Thick black lines show the inverted repeats (IRs) in the chloroplast genomes. Genome regions are color-coded as protein coding, rRNA coding, tRNA coding or conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) whereas arrows show the gene presence.       Analysis of repetitive sequences  Repetitive sequencing in cp genomes plays an important function and enhances the current understanding of the evolutionary aspects of plant species [ 62 – 63 ]. Mononucleotide microsatellite length polymorphisms have been used as markers to understand the evolutionary history of cp genomes, reflecting the high variability rates of these anomalies [ 56 ]. In the present study, a total of 109 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were observed in the B . sacra chloroplast genome, sharing 1,256 bp (ca. 0.78%) of the total sequence ( Table 4 ). Most of the SSRs were identified in intergenic regions, and some SSRs were identified in coding areas, such as rpoC2 and ycf1 , which could also be used as molecular markers for population diversity studies [ 63 ]. A total 39 large repeats of more than 30 bp in length were identified in the B . sacra cp genome ( Table 5 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.t004  Table 4  List of simple sequence repeats.

Sequences conserved in the A . indica chloroplast genome are highlighted in bold.  *The 65 bp sequence is truncated copy of 204 bp sequence.    In case of tandem repeat, some of the conifers have been noted for the presence of large number of such repeats [ 64 ]. These repeats have been associated with gene duplication and chloroplast rearrangement [ 65 ]. The results of tandem repeat analysis showed a total 30 repeats ( Table 6 ). The highest size of repeats was 76 bp in length accD in the coding region whereas the lowest was 12 bp trnK/rps16 in the intergenic spacer region, with average copy number 2.4. The percent of indels were ranged from 0 to 18 ( Table 6 ). A majority of these repeats were located in intergenic spacers, while five repeat sequences were identified in the coding regions of trnS-GCU , trnS-GGA , ycf2 , psaB and psaA . Eight long repeats were identified in A . indica , suggesting that these repeats might be well distributed among Sapindales. In a recent study, Addisalem et al. [ 65 ] developed the first set of 46 SSR markers and estimated the genome size for B . papyrifera as 705 Mb, representing the first genome sequence analysis for any species of this genus. However, the current knowledge of the genomics and transcriptomics of this keystone species remains limited.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.t006  Table 6  Distribution of tandem repeats in the B . sacra chloroplast genome.

These estimates are produced using the joint Maximum Likelihood reconstructions of ancestral states under a Muse-Gaut Model [ 67 ] of nucleotide substitution. A total to 8,301 positions were noted in the chloroplast genomes of B . sacra , A . indica and Citrus sinensis . In case of codons, TCT, GTT, GGA and CGT showed high n, S, N and dN-dS ( S8 Table ). However, the P value was less than 0.05 showing a significant substitution among cp genomes. The normalized dN/dS ratio was calculated for the three cp genomes which showed a positive selection ranging from 0~10.17. The number of segregating sites were 14,249 in three cp genomes with a nucleotide diversity was 0.063. The nucleotide frequencies are 30.59% (A), 31.21% (T/U), 19.49% (C), and 18.71% (G) in the cp genomes. The transition/transversion rate ratios are k1 = 2.149 (purines) and k2 = 2.072 (pyrimidines). The overall transition/transversion bias is R = 0.996. These shows that B . sacra , A . indica and Citrus sinensis species with long generation times, and both exhibit little changes in the structural organization of the chloroplast genomes. This could further reveal how these species evolved at low rates. Similar perspectives were shown for the chloroplast genomes of five Quercus species [ 66 ]. The estimation of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates may play an important role in understanding the dynamics of molecular evolution, and non-synonymous substitutions could be subject to natural selection during the evolutionary process [ 66 – 68 ].    Evolution of orf56 and ycf68 within sapindales  We compared the orf56 and ycf68 genes of three tree species viz. B . sacra , A . indica and C . sinensis ( Fig 4 ), revealing the presence of these genes in the three species. The orf56 gene is present in an intron in the trnA-UGC gene, which contains one homologous sequence, known as mitochondrial ACR-toxin sensitivity gene in Citrus trees [ 22 , 69 ]. Interestingly, the full-length orf56 gene sequence was different but was intact in all three species. Goremykin et al. [ 70 ] previously reported that the ACR-toxin sensitivity gene was transferred between plastid and mitochondrial genomes [ 22 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.g004  Fig 4   Comparison of the border positions of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions in three Sapindales species.     The ycf68 gene, in the trnI-GAU intron of the IR region, showed high similarity between C . sinensis and B . sacra . However, an additional T-insertion near the C-terminus was abolished at the stop codon [ 22 ]. A . indica has a T-deletion near the C-terminus abolished at the stop codon in the same position. Comparatively, an intact ycf68 gene was detected in B . sacra ( Fig 4 ). Raubeson et al. [ 71 ] suggested that ycf68 is not a protein-coding gene based on the lack of intron folding patterns. The high levels of sequence conservation among the ORF of identified homologs indicates true functionality [ 72 ]. However, the function of this putative gene still remains unclear and needs further investigation.    Phylogenetic analysis of B . sacra  To obtain insight into the position of B . sacra within the Malvidae, we generated datasets of 32 completely sequenced chloroplast genomes, using Vitis venefera as an outgroup ( S1 Table ). We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the B . sacra cp genome with the cp genomes from 8 species of Myrtaceae (Corymbia eximia , Angophora costata , Eucalyptus umbra , E . deglupta , E . globulus , Stockwellia quadrifida , Syzygium cumini and Allosyncarpia ternata ), 2 species from Melianthaceae ( Francoa sonchifolia and Theorbroma cacao ), 3 species from Malvaceae ( Gossypium incanum , G . tomentosum , and G . hirsutum ), 15 species from Brassicaceae (Barbarea verna , Nasturtium officinale , Lepidium virginicum , Pachycladon enysii , P . cheesemanii , Crucihimalaya wallichii , Olimarabidopsis pumila , Capsella bursa-pastoris , Arabidopsis thaliana , Lobularia maritima , Brassica napus , Arabis hirsuta , Draba nemorosa , Aethionema cordifolium and Aethionema grandiflorum ), one species from Caricaceae ( Carica papaya ) and one species from Rutaceae ( Citrus sinensis ).  The phylogenetic analysis included some commercially important Sapindales plants and the more relevant A . indica species from Maliaceae. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree resolved 33 nodes, with strong bootstrap support of 55–100 ( Fig 5 ). These results strongly support the position of the B . sacra within Sapindales. The phylogenetic trees obtained in the present study also indicate a close relationship between B . sacra and A . indica with high bootstrap support (100%). Krishnan et al. [ 73 ] suggested that both A . indica and Citrus sinensis form a homogenous group (100%), validating the conventional taxonomic classification of A . indica . Thus, the results of the phylogenetic analysis of the cp genome of both species showed the formation of a distinct cladogram with B . sacra , revealing new insights to understand the gene structure of these three plants.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169794.g005  Fig 5   Neighbor-Joining phylogeny of the representative Malvidae lineages.  The common grape vine ( Vitis vinifera ) is included as the outgroup to root the tree. A total of 33 complete chloroplast genomes were aligned. In total, 33 nodes were resolved. The position of B . sacra is shown in bold.     The habitats of B . sacra and A . indica are different, however, the fact that both plants produce oleugum and belong to the same order suggests interesting prospects for broader evolutionary studies of Sapindales [ 74 ]. This phylogenetic relationship was further confirmed by constructing the maximum parsimony tree [ 48 ], suggesting a close homology with C . sinensis and A . indica ( S2 Fig ). The Bayesian Inference (BI) also highly supported as monophyletic (100/1.00) behavior C . sinensis and A . indica . Whereas a sister relationship of B . sacra was well supported (100/1.00). The posterior probabilities (PP) were also 1.0 for B . sacra , C . sinensis and A . indica ( S4 Fig ), suggesting a branching order as (( C . sinensis , A . indica ), B . sacra ). A similar phylogenomic reconstruction was also noticed by Wang et al. [ 16 , 75 ], where Actinidiaceae formed a monophyly relationship in Ericales.     Conclusions  Using a combination of de novo assembly and reference genome analysis, we provided the first completely sequenced chloroplast genome of endemic Boswellia sacra . The genome organization and gene structure is almost typical to that of angiosperms plants. The main difference in the gene composition between the B . sacra and A . indica cp genomes was the protein-coding gene in the trnH-GUG-psbA region. Notably, eight shared SSR regions were identified in the B . sacra and A . indica cp genome comparison. Elucidating these regions could provide additional phylogenetic insights at the taxonomic level, and these results could be used to develop molecular markers [ 72 ]. Previously, Coppi et al. [ 31 ] suggested that different stands of tree populations growing in different areas showed significant variations in genetic distances. The findings of the present study are essential to envisage fresh in-depth intuitions into various aspects of Boswellia chloroplast genome evolution. The current new genomic datasets will enable further exploration of the genetic diversity of Boswellia sacra and the other 18 species of this genus.

The tumor microenvironment is composed of cellular and stromal components such as tumor cells, mesenchymal cells, immune cells, cancer associated fibroblasts and the supporting extracellular matrix. The tumor microenvironment provides crucial support for growth and progression of tumor cells and affects tumor response to therapeutic interventions. To better understand tumor biology and to develop effective cancer therapeutic agents it is important to develop preclinical platforms that can faithfully recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and the complex interaction between the tumor and its surrounding stromal elements. Drug studies performed in vitro with conventional two-dimensional cancer cell line models do not optimally represent clinical drug response as they lack true tumor heterogeneity and are often performed in static culture conditions lacking stromal tumor components that significantly influence the metabolic activity and proliferation of cells. Recent microfluidic approaches aim to overcome such obstacles with the use of cell lines derived in artificial three-dimensional supportive gels or micro-chambers. However, absence of a true tumor microenvironment and full interstitial flow, leads to less than optimal evaluation of tumor response to drug treatment. Here we report a continuous perfusion microfluidic device coupled with microscopy and image analysis for the assessment of drug effects on intact fresh tumor tissue. We have demonstrated that fine needle aspirate biopsies obtained from patient-derived xenograft models of adenocarcinoma of the lung can successfully be analyzed for their response to ex vivo drug treatment within this biopsy trapping microfluidic device, wherein a protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, was used to assess tumor cell death as a proof of principle. This approach has the potential to study tumor tissue within its intact microenvironment to better understand tumor response to drug treatments and eventually to choose the most effective drug and drug combination for individual patients in a cost effective and timely manner.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006353  Charles Stark Draper Laboratory     Angela Babetski Holton        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005567  H.

Current treatment options are based on large statistical sampling, which lack personalized therapeutic approaches for individual cancer patients. Hence, clinically relevant, reliable drug testing approaches would effectively match the patient to the best therapy in the shortest possible time. The complexity increases further as clinicians try to resolve these differences while prescribing treatment plans for each patient and their individualized disease. Thus, next generation treatments must clearly focus on patient specific responses to spare uncertain toxicity and additional non-effective prolonged courses of chemotherapy.  Cell-based assays and preclinical animal models have provided researchers platforms to discover both molecular and genetic biomarkers related to the progression of the disease. Elements of the tumor microenvironment have been shown to be instructive to tumor cells, making them more or less tumorigenic [ 2 ]. Genetic and epigenetic differences within each cell determine whether specific drug therapies will prove efficacious to each patient [ 3 – 5 ]. Tumor heterogeneity has proven culpable to the variability in response to chemotherapy. The spatial architecture and the resulting distribution of cells within the tumor can affect how they interact with each other and their microenvironment, impacting proliferation, differentiation, morphology and a range of cellular functions [ 6 , 7 ]. Current in vitro chemosensitivity testing models, using cell lines or cloned cells selected from patient tumors, do not represent the tumor heterogeneity and the true microenvironment of the tumor. It has been demonstrated that the proliferation rate of the cells in a two-dimensional cell culture model are additionally 110–158% higher than that of three- dimensional cell culture format [ 8 , 9 ]. Also, it is known that specific cancer drugs are more effective during the proliferative state [ 10 ]. Therefore, cancer cells grown in three-dimensional environments often show more resistance to cytotoxic agents than those grown in two-dimensional cultures [ 8 ]. More importantly, the cell culture conditions found in a conventional cell culture model may not be homogenous, primarily because of static and concentrated chemical gradients within the cell culture system. Chemosensitivity assays that use primary cultures of cells grown from surgically excised tumor specimens and incubated with a panel of therapeutic drugs are also performed in static conditions, often in a well-plate configuration [ 11 , 12 ]. Limiting the tumor samples to a static environment hampers full nutritive support confounding the true efficacy of the drug treatment. Further, most biopsy driven models offer only an end-point analysis of how the cancer cells respond to treatment without regard to each samples own baseline health prior to the initiation of the drug exposure [ 13 ]. The resulting poorly defined extracellular conditions in a cell culture system can hamper precise quantification of the link between cellular responses and the tested conditions [ 14 ]. Although chemosensitivity testing is an intuitively attractive concept, to date they have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy to predict tumor responses in vivo, mainly because the ex vivo growth of tumor cells in static well plate conditions may lead to artificial selection of specific tumor subpopulations depending on culture conditions, thereby limiting ultimate clinical correlation [ 15 , 16 ].  Tumor is a heterogeneous tissue receiving continued stimuli from its microenvironment where the cancer cells dynamically shift their response to both chemical communications and mechanical forces in time and space. Therefore to accurately assess a tumor’s response to drug therapy, the microenvironment’s response requires a dynamic but controlled and measured approach for multiple cell types over a variety of time points and conditions [ 17 , 18 ]. Through the use of microfluidics, cultured environments can be controlled to homogeneous microenvironments with low chemical gradients [ 19 – 21 ]. Unlike a static cell culture, a perfusion cell culture model can provide a system for continuous nutrient supply and removal of metabolic products, thereby maintaining a more stable culture environment [ 14 , 22 ]. Additionally, a controlled environment offers the additional advantage of being capable of creating hydrodynamic forces, such as shear stress, in the physiological range as seen in vascular capillaries and tissues known to have Reynolds numbers <100, resulting in predominantly diffusion based characteristics, over spatial distances of approximately 100 μm [ 23 , 24 ] within which cellular metabolite uptake, gaseous exchange and waste removal occurs [ 25 ]. Microfluidics are low cost, micro-sized footprints that offer high sensitivity with high throughput results while having the advantage of temporal control of physics, biology, chemistry and physiology at the cellular level [ 26 ]. Small dimensions, low burden on reagent use with controllable and well-defined culture conditions make microfluidics valuable for drug testing studies.  Recent in vitro microfluidic approaches have attempted to recapitulate some of the tumor architecture but relied mainly on cancer cell lines that lack important phenotypes of the primary cancer cells due to prolonged culture in serum with growth and attachment on tissue culture plastic; not representative of the parent tumor. Three-dimensional gels derived from animals such as bovine collagen are variable in composition [ 27 , 28 ] and can pose variability between samples grown in their presence. Synthetic hydrogels often require post processing with radiation, ultraviolet, or chemical catalysts which may be toxic to the cells [ 28 , 29 ]. Additionally, artificial three-dimensional scaffolds, contain less of the essential stromal elements such as extracellular matrix (ECM) component and stromal cells found in the tumor microenvironment in vivo and therefore do not support an environment for native cellular behavior. The interaction between cells and the ECM is intimate and dynamic. The ECM applies mechanical forces that guide cellular organization [ 30 ] and directs cellular behavior and differentiation through inherent signaling proteins and or its diffusion properties of external and intercellular signaling [ 31 ]. Cells also can respond to their local environment, remodeling local ECM, by degrading or synthesizing new ECM elements [ 32 ]. Additionally, the diffusion of nutrients, metabolic products and soluble cytokines is critically controlled in tumors and difficult to mimic using artificial three-dimensional matrix materials. For example there is no distinct microporous structure in hydrogels thus, mass transport mainly depends on slow diffusion through submicron-sized pores. The density of the gels can cause variations in mass transport of oxygen and nutrients throughout the sample [ 33 ] and may influence the hydrodynamic properties of the microfluidic channel creating increased resistance to flow by occluding a greater percentage of the channel. Variations in the microenvironment of the cellular samples and fluidic properties of the device further complicate analysis of drug effects on platform. Still, the high water content (95.0–99.5%) enables sufficient exchange of essential biomolecules and metabolic end-products to maintain cell viability in a limited thickness but at the same time offers weak mechanical properties [ 34 ]. Static or diffusion-based fluidic models are provided by reservoirs on or off chip or with the fabrication of microchambers or cavities for the cell structures and nutritive media supply [ 35 ]. Other microfluidics systems deliver pulsatile flow with periods of flow and no flow or pulsations intermittently for purposes of nutritional and or drug delivery therefore delivering pressures and shear at varying levels [ 13 , 36 ]. Fluid shear stress has important consequences on the proliferation dynamics of cancer cells [ 37 – 39 ]. Applied shear resulting in the deformation of the cell membrane, leading to changes in signaling cascades, affects not only the cytoskeleton but also gene transcription that ultimately affects cell growth, survival and response to therapeutic agents.  One of the main challenges in the development of in vitro assays to predict tumor response to treatment is the availability of fresh tumor tissue obtained from patients. We have previously described a novel short-term ex vivo assay to explore pharmacodynamic predictors and indicators of response to anticancer drugs by using tumor fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) samples. The patient-derived pre-clinical xenograft mouse studies and the results of the clinical studies performed by our group demonstrated that the short term ex vivo assay has a high negative predictive value and provides pharmacodynamic data to identify patients whose tumor would likely respond to treatment [ 40 ]. To add to this ex vivo approach we have developed a novel three-dimensional microfluidics approach using patient tumor samples obtained by FNAB that provide micron-scale tumor tissue where the interaction between tumor and its microenvironment are maintained in their biological configuration. The device was fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by a photolithography process having 10 channels each with a centralized array of oblong posts that trap the biopsy when delivered into the device by injection. The biopsy sample is held in place while the device is primed with fresh media. The device is high- throughput in which each channel may be fed by a separate reservoir or multiple reservoirs allowing single agent or combinatorial treatment regimens that have the capability to be also temporally altered throughout the progression of treatment. FNAB tumor samples are added to the system and analyzed for their baseline health prior to the onset of treatment. The FNAB tumor samples are then monitored throughout the treatment period for progression of death through apoptosis and viability signified by detection of esterase activity within the intact cell.  We hypothesize that a re-circulating multi-trap multi-channel microfluidic device capable of introducing multiple drug combinations to patient derived biopsies will maintain the microenvironment of the tumor and may recapitulate in vivo tumor response to drug treatment, which ultimately can be used for personalized cancer therapy. Herein, we demonstrate a cytotoxic drug model using a known protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine [ 41 ], to optimize the microfluidic device towards a potential clinically relevant chemosensitivity assay.    Materials and Methods   Microfluidic device design and fabrication  The design of the microfluidic network was created in L-Edit with the dimensions of the 10 microfluidic channels, trapping posts and inlets and outlets. A transparency mask was created from the design file printed by a high-resolution printer. The transparency mask was used in a soft-photolithography process using tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane (Gelest Inc, Morrisville, PA), photoresist to create a silicon wafer master. The silicon wafer was patterned with tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl trichlorosilane using standard photolithography techniques to create a mold for forming the channels and traps. Uncured PDMS (10:1 base to curing agent weight ratio) was cast on top of the wafer to a thickness of 6 mm followed by degassing and curing at 65°C for 12 hours. The cast PDMS was peeled from the mold and fluidic inlet/outlet ports were made using a 1 mm biopsy punch for each channel. Devices were cleaned with 70% isopropanol, rinsed with sterile filtered H 2 0 and further rid of debris by filtered forced air. The PDMS surface of the device was rendered hydrophilic by exposure to oxygen plasma (Plasma Etch PE-100 Asher, Carson City, NV at 100 mTorr, 10 s, 150 W) to facilitate scaffold loading of a glass slide that seals the channel of the device. Finally the device was sterilized by ethylene oxide gas and kept in their sterilized pouches until use. Fig 1 demonstrates the overall device features and the trap configuration in the 10 channels of the device.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169797.g001  Fig 1   Microfluidic device design.

(C) Solid Works rendering of a channel in the device showing the central post arrangement used to trap each FNAB tissue sample. The channel is 10 mm long, 600 μm wide and 125 μm in height. Each post is 150 μm long, 75 μm wide and 125 μm in height.       Establishment of patient-derived xenograft  This study was approved by the University of South Florida’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and Institutional Review Board. All animals were maintained and evaluated in accordance with IACUC standards care in pathogen-free rooms at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (Tampa, FL). Patient derived xenograft models are established using fresh tissue obtained at the time of resection from patients with lung, melanoma and bladder cancers and established as an F1 generation through subcutaneous implantation into four-week-old female immunodeficient hairless Crl:SHO-Prkdc-SCID-Hr-hr mice (Charles River Laboratories). The patients provided written informed consent for the study. The tumors from this initial passage are harvested and implanted subcutaneously into F2 generation. Tumors are allowed to grow to a size of 1.5 cm, at which point they are harvested, divided into small 3 × 3 × 3 mm pieces, and transplanted to an F3 generation. At the end of the experiment protocol, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after carbon dioxide sedation.    FNAB procedure and loading FNAB samples on device  FNAB was performed using a 25-gauge needle where the subcutaneous tumor was sampled from all areas of the tumor, as previously described [ 42 , 43 ]. Following the procedure, a Diff-Quik (DQ) stain was performed on the smear samples to both validate viable tissue was captured in the biopsy and also characterization of the pathology of the cancer. FNAB tumor samples were received immediately after biopsy procedure and transported on ice in RPMI media (RPMI 1640, phenol red and sodium bicarbonate powder 25 mM HEPES, 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 0.3 g/mL L-glutamine, sterile filtered before use). The FNAB tumor sample was centrifuged at 200xg for 10 minutes discarding the supernatant and resuspended with fresh media. FNAB tumor fragments measuring ~300 μm in diameter were selected for introduction into the device. FNAB fragments are elastic and therefore able to deform to the confined space of the channel dimensions. FNAB tumor samples were placed in the reservoirs attached to the peristaltic pump and perfused with complete media at a flow rate of 125 μL/hr. Media and or drug were retained in reservoirs individual to each channel covered with a 2 μm pore gas permeable membrane open to atmospheric conditions allowing oxygen to dissolve into media. The percent of dissolved oxygen in media was validated in prior multi-day experiments on platform with oxygen sensors (NEOFOX-KIT-PROBE, Ocean Optics). Additionally, the amount of oxygen that could be supplied into a PDMS device per day, based on our device dimensions, was estimated to be 3.5x10 -5 mol O 2 /device day [ 44 , 45 ]. The oxygen within PDMS per day is sufficient to sustain FNAB biopsy with roughly 1000 cells with a total respiration of sample to be 8.64x10 -9 mol/day. Therefore, adequate oxygen is delivered to the FNAB sample per day if the system was stagnant but because the media is additionally renewed with flow rates of 125 μL/hr, oxygen is renewed more often in the device. The temperature of the system was maintained at 37°C by a microscope incubation chamber.    Evaluation of small molecule drug perfusion in FNAB  Doxorubicin HCL purchased from Sigma Aldrich was reconstituted with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 1 mg/mL. A working concentration of 1 μM, diluted with cell culture media, (RPMI 1640, without glutamine, phenol red and sodium bicarbonate powder) was made by adding 25 mM HEPES, 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 0.3 g/mL L-glutamine sterile filtered before use. The 1 μM doxorubicin solution was delivered by peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 125 μL/hr for a 24-hour period. Fluorescent imaging was performed by a Zeiss Axio ObserverZ.1/ApoTome.2 inverted scope over a 24-hour period to measure drug perfusion throughout the FNAB sample in device.    Evaluation of large molecule perfusion in FNAB  A perCP/Cy5.5 conjugated EpCAM mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody (VU-1D9, abcam) and a FITC conjugated CD44 mouse anti-human (clone G44-26, BD pharmingen TM ) and their respective isotype controls, mouse IgG1 monoclonal MOPC-21 (perCP/Cy5.5, abcam) and Dnk pAb to Ms IgG (Dylight®488, abcam) were diluted with RPMI media to a working solution 1:200. FNAB tumor samples were loaded into nine separate channels. The antibody solution containing both the EpCAM and CD44 was perfused into three channels. The isotype control antibodies, used to evaluate for nonspecific binding, were perfused into three other channels. The last three channels contained media only to serve as background auto-fluorescence controls for tissue. One channel was not needed and therefore not used for this experiment. A flow rate of 125 μL/hr was used for all channels. Fluorescent imaging was performed by a Zeiss Axio ObserverZ.1/ApoTome.2 inverted scope using a 378HE Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) filter (excitation: 450-490nm /emission: 500-550nm) and a 45 Texas Red (TR) filter (emission: 540-580/excitation: 593-668nm) over a 24-hour period.    Staurosporine treatment  Staurosporine was reconstituted with DMSO to a stock concentration of 10 mM. A further working solution of 50 μM was made diluted with RPMI media. Two experimental groups were tested, a negative vehicle control group; media only with 0.1% DMSO, and a 50 μM staurosporine treated group. FNAB tumor samples were tested in triplicate for each group across 6 test sessions. A total volume of 1.5 mL in each reservoir containing either test condition was discretely circulated through each channel of the device containing a single FNAB tumor ~300 μm fragment for a treatment period of 5 days.    Measurement of viability and death  Calcein AM viability stains (Molecular Probes) and CF594-Annexin V (Biotium) antibody were both added to cell culture media with binding buffer for final concentrations of 5 μM for each dye. The dye solution was then used to perfuse FNAB tumor samples to assess for viability and apoptosis in real time continuously over the time course of experiments. Fluorescent imaging was performed by a Zeiss Axio ObserverZ.1/ApoTome.2 inverted scope using a 378HE Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) filter (excitation: 450-490nm /emission: 500-550nm) and a 45 Texas Red (TR) filter (emission: 540-580/excitation: 593-668nm) for Calcein AM and CF594-AnnexinV respectively. ZEN 2012 software was used to calculate the sum of intensity units throughout the FNAB tumor fragments in each device channel. Background and or auto-fluorescence were subtracted out from each summed value of intensity. The sum of intensity values for both Calcein AM and CF594-AnnexinV were normalized for each FNAB tumor fragment by dividing the summed values of intensity of each emission by the size (area μm 2 ) of the FNAB tumor fragment in each z-axis throughout the volume of the tumor fragment to give total relative fluorescent units ( tRFUs ) for each FNAB tumor fragment. The health of each FNAB tumor fragment at the end of each drug trial was reported as a viability index ( Vi ) = GFP tRFUs (viability) / TR tRFUs (apoptosis) to normalize all samples across all test sessions.    Statistical analysis  The mean and standard error of each treatment group was calculated with n = 18 samples. A repeated measures ANOVA analysis was performed for Within-Subjects Effects across the 5-day testing period for both groups. A Greenhouse-Geisser correction was performed for violation against sphericity. Sphericity is an assumption that the variances of the differences between all possible pairs of groups are equal. If sphericity is violated, then the variance calculations could result in an inflated F-ratio with the proportion of rejections of the null hypothesis larger than the α-level when the null hypothesis is true. In order to minimize this problem, Greenhouse-Geisser procedure corrects the deviation to sphericity by using an index to correct the number of degrees of freedom of the F-distribution [ 46 ]. To determine the significance between groups, a Student’s two-tailed t test was performed from the calculated mean and standard deviation of each treatment group. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.     Results   Evaluation of small molecule drug perfusion through the FNAB on device  A model of fluid flowing in the channel of the microfluidic device was designed to understand how various parameters such as flow rate, channel dimensions and tumor size would affect the FNAB tissue sample in the designed trap ( S1 Text ). To assess the shear stress on a tumor, we simulated a tumor, trapped inside a channel by the posts ( S1 Fig ). To assess the accuracy of the simulation model performed with multiphysics software licensed from COMSOL, we tested the fluid profile through the device with 1μm diameter polystyrene beads conjugated to a fluorophore with an excitation/emission wavelength of 580/605 nm ( S1 Text ). With concerns of lack of interstitial flow at the tumor interface in the center of the channel, seen from results of the fluorescent bead assay with FNAB tumor fragment in channel ( S2 Fig ), we next tested the advective properties of fluid flow through FNAB tumor samples using a homogenous fluorescent solution. We predicted that the size of the 1μm diameter fluorescent beads, previously used, did not accurately depict homogenous fluid flow. Therefore, we opted to use a soluble small molecular weight compound to track interstitial flow and drug penetration throughout the FNAB tumor fragment. We selected Doxorubicin HCL (Sigma Aldrich, USA) for its natural fluorescence in a spectrum similar to FITC with an excitation of 480 nm and an emission of 560–590 nm [ 47 , 48 ]. We hypothesized, if the bead assay was correct and the fluid path was restricted by the FNAB tumor fragment in channel with lower to no flow velocities in the center of the channel and higher velocities at the side walls of the channel, there would be evidence of fluorescent gradients of Doxorubicin seen throughout the FNAB tumor fragment. Fluorescent intensities would be weak or nonexistent with little to no drug in cells of the tumor fragment residing in the central portion of the channel and higher intensities with greater drug concentrations in cells of the tumor fragment residing nearest the sidewalls of the channels. Secondly, with flow restriction, the infusion of drug into cells would occur first in areas of the tumor that experience greatest flow, specifically, at the tumor interface where the tumor fragment first meets the fluid front. The cells located in the backside of the tumor fragment, specifically at the center of the channel, would experience a delay in drug infusion due to the lag time in flow and low to no flow velocities as demonstrated by the fluorescent bead assay. To test for full tumor drug penetration we selected lung adenocarcinoma FNAB tumor samples taken from patient derived xenograft mice as previously explained. Doxorubicin was introduced into a reservoir of cultured media at a working dilution of 1μM. The drug solution was pumped into the channels with FNAB tumor fragments in trap for a period of 24 hours. Over the 24-hour period, continuous fluorescent imaging results indicated a gradual uptake of the drug into the cells demonstrated by an influx of green fluorescence into distinct clearly defined semi-circular membrane bound cells. Fluorescent intensities of the drug were evenly distributed across the tumor sample occurring simultaneously in all areas of the tumor throughout the 24-hour period ( Fig 2A ). Excitingly, we were also able to capture resulting apoptotic cellular behavior during the 24-hour period of drug infusion. Apoptosis was signified by chromatin clumping and condensation with nuclear fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies evident from high intensity concentrations of the dye and foreign body formation [ 49 ] ( Fig 2B ). Apoptosis was seen in all regions of the tumor sample and occurred simultaneously at opposing ends of the flow both in cells located in the center of the tumor sample and at the sidewalls.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169797.g002  Fig 2   Assessment of small molecule drug perfusion in a tumor FNA fragment using Doxorubicin HCL.  (A) Drug perfusion after an 8-hour period showing distribution of drug indicated by green fluorescent intensity spatially similar throughout the FNAB tissue sample. (B) Drug perfusion after a 24-hour period showing intensity peaks spatially similar throughout the FNAB tissue sample and the formation of apoptotic bodies.       Evaluation of large molecule protein antibody perfusion through the FNAB on device  Full drug perfusion through the full FNAB tumor fragment was successfully demonstrated with a small molecular weight compound solution of doxorubicin HCl. The next step was to determine if larger molecular weight protein based molecules could penetrate the FNAB tumor sample during fluid perfusion. To demonstrate large molecule profusion through FNAB tumor samples we used protein antibodies that warranted specific recognition of a protein/protein interaction with the tumor tissue. An antibody, conjugated to Cy5 fluorophores, raised against EpCAM that is expressed on the cell membranes of most carcinomas, and an antibody conjugated to FITC fluorophores prepared against CD44, another cell membrane protein expressed on tumors of epithelial origin, were used. EpCAM and CD44 were diluted to a working concentration of 1:200 and introduced into the device with a flow rate of 125 μL/hr. Isotype controls for each antibody were purchased with the same fluorophore to indicate nonspecific binding in the device. Fluorescent imaging was performed by z-axis plane evaluation with 20 μm spacing showing both regional specificity of the tumor tissue and full perfusion throughout the whole FNAB tumor sample over a 24-hour period. After a 4-hour perfusion of antibody solution of both EpCAM and CD44, the antibodies could be seen throughout the FNAB tumor sample. FNAB tumor sample show slight changes both in the concentrations and where both EpCAM and CD44 are located throughout the tumor after 12 and 24-hour perfusions ( S3 Fig ). Results indicated that the isotype controls did not bind to the FNAB tumor fragments indicated by the absence of fluorescence throughout the FNAB tumor sample ( Fig 3A ). EpCAM and CD44 antibodies did bind distinctively throughout the FNAB tumor sample as seen through multiple z-axis images with 40 μm from the surface of the tumor (z/5), through the interior of the tumor (z/7 and z/9), with completion on the opposing side, 30μm from the surface (z/11) ( Fig 3B ). Binding was specifically mediated by recognition through protein-protein interactions as opposed to being inadvertently forced into the tissue by mechanical forces generated by flow in a nonspecific fashion.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169797.g003  Fig 3   Evaluation of antibody perfusion through the tumor FNAB on device.  (A) 10x Phase contrast image of FNAB sample in trap of device and 10x fluorescent z-axis images (z5, z7, z9, z11) 24 hours post the staining procedure using isotype control antibodies for both EpCAM (red-Cy5) and CD44 (green-FITC). (B) 10x Phase contrast image of FNAB sample in trap of device and 10x fluorescent z-axis images (z5, z7, z9, z11) 24 hours post the staining procedure using EpCAM (red-Cy5) and CD44 (green-FITC).       Assessment of tumor viability  Next, we sought to determine how long fresh FNAB tumor samples would remain viable in the device and also to characterize the working limitations of the viability dye, Calcein AM, and apoptotic antibody stain, CF594-AnnexinV. The results from the viability experiments were then used to determine the optimal length of a drug treatment trial for later experiments. FNAB tumor fragments were each placed in a channel of the device and perfused with circulating cell culture media with 5 μM Calcein AM Green and 5 μM CF594-AnnexinV, as previously described in the methods section. A baseline Vi analysis was performed on each FNAB tumor fragment after 12 hours of being in the device to determine the ratio of viable cells to apoptotic cells in each FNBA tumor sample. Those fragments with a Vi of <0.9 were deemed as nonviable and rejected from further analysis. FNAB tumor fragments were then continuously measured each day over a total period of 10 days. It was found, with all samples, that after 6 days in device the Vi decreased steadily with a sharp decrease in the tRFUs for the Calcein AM and a small less dramatic fluxuation in the tRFUs for the CF594-AnnexinV. Calcein AM is a cell-permeant dye that can be used to determine cell viability in eukaryotic cells. Modification of carboxylic acids with AM ester groups results in an uncharged molecule that can permeate cell membranes. Once inside the cell, the lipophilic blocking groups are cleaved through hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases in the cytoplasm of metabolically active and healthy cells, resulting in a charged form that fluoresces. CF594-AnnexinV is a 35–36 kDa protein that has a high affinity for phosphatidylserine. In normal membrane intact viable cells, phosphatidylserine is located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. In apoptotic cells, phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, making itself available for AnnexinV binding. To determine if the decreasing tRFUs for Calcein AM was due to a decline in FNAB tumor sample viability or the working limitations of the Calcein AM dye, we re-challenged the system in several ways. First, we added fresh FNAB tumor fragments to the channels containing the Calcein AM Green and CF594-AnnexinV solution. The newly added fresh FNAB tumor fragments did not take up the Calcein AM Green dye. Next, we re-challenged the FNAB tumor fragments with CalceinAM Blue by adding a 5 μM concentration of Calcein AM Blue to the original circulating 5 μM Calcein AM Green solution. Calcein AM Blue was added to rule out if the fluorescent capability of Calcein AM Green had extinguished either by photo-bleaching due to continuous monitoring over the course of experiment and or quenching by use of the CF594-AnnexinV fluorophore. The FNAB tumor fragments did not take up the Calcein AM Blue. We then added a second round of fresh FNAB tumor fragments to the same channels. The second round of newly added fresh FNAB tumor fragments, without prior exposure to the original Calcein AM Green dye, showed a dramatic increase of Calcein AM Blue uptake into cells resulting in an increase of intensity values after a 4-hour period of incubation. Last, to test substrate concentration limitations of CalceinAM at a 5 μM concentration over the 10-day experiment, we flushed the system from the re-circulating Calcein AM and CF594-AnnexinV dyes and reintroduced newly made 5 μM CalceinAM Green and 5 μM CF594-AnnexinV to the existing, previously exposed, FNAB tumor fragments in channels and also added fresh FNAB fragments to the channel. The intensity values for Calcein AM Green increased slightly for the previously exposed FNAB fragments but only after a 48-hour period of exposure and in a limited number of cells in isolated regions of the FNAB tumor fragments. The newly added FNAB fragments resulted in the uptake of dyes with strong intensity. Experiments and results are summarized in Table 1 . Results indicated that the fluorophore, in the original solution containing Calcein AM Green, had extinguished and was not able to be detected. Also, previously administered Calcein AM competitively blocked its cellular targets from binding newly added Calcein AM Green or Calcein AM Blue demonstrating that a working concentration of 5 μM was adequate for continuous binding in viable cells. In addition, it was also seen that FNAB tumor samples sustained in the system over a 10-day period, continued to take up newly added Calcein AM dye when new cells were populated in the FNAB tumor fragments. CF594-AnnexinV continued to fluoresce in the system with increased intensity peaking after 10 days. We determined that the longevity of the fluorophore conjugated to the Calcein AM had a working imitation of 5 days either due to photo-bleaching and or quenching within the system. These results show that drug experiments should ideally be performed within 5 days of placing the tumor tissue in the microfluidics device.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169797.t001  Table 1  Calcein AM dye validation and FNAB sample viability assessment.

After the 12-hour viability assessment, with samples showing a Vi ratio >0.9, with approximately as many viable cells in the FNAB tumor sample than apoptotic cells, FNAB tumor fragments were then exposed to their assigned experimental condition. The test groups included a negative control group, conditioned with media and 0.1% DMSO and a drug treatment group, conditioned with 50 μM staurosporine. Each experiment was run continuously for a treatment period of 5 days. Each condition was run in triplicate for every device session tested totaling 6 experimental sessions (n = 18; each treatment group). Images were taken of each FNAB tumor fragment for every 24-hour time point over the course of 5 days. The images were later analyzed for the tRFUs of Calcein AM and CF594-AnnexinV. A viability index ( Vi ) was calculated for each sample at every time point and then averaged across all samples within a group for each time point. Each group was evaluated by a repeated measures ANOVA analysis for Within-Subjects Effects calculated across the 5-day testing period. A Greenhouse-Geisser correction was performed for violation against sphericity. Results for each group indicated a significant linear change over the course of the 5-day experiment (p = 0.003) with increased standard error at days 4 and 5 for the negative control group and days 1, 2 and 3 for the staurosporine treatment group. Increased standard error during those days was due to greater variability in Vi across samples within a treatment group. The means of each group were then compared at each time point for statistical significance. On average, the Vi for the negative control groups increased as the testing session continued over the course of 5 days, but decreased for the staurosporine treatment group ( Fig 4A ) with a statistical significance of p = 0.0355 for day 1 and p = 0.0001 for days 2–5. Fig 4B shows a three-dimensional view of the representative FNAB tumor fragments from both the negative control groups ( Fig 4B.1 and Fig 4B.3 ) and the staurosporine treated groups ( Fig 4C.1 and Fig 4C.3 ) at days 1 and day 5. Each view shows the ratio of viable cells (green) to apoptotic cells (red) and also how they are spatially organized and distributed within the FNAB tumor fragments. The representative negative control fragment at day 1 ( Fig 4B.1 ) has a greater concentration of viable cells throughout the FNAB tumor fragment than the concentration of CF594-AnnexinV antibody protein on apoptotic cells, found mostly at the periphery of the sample. At day 5, ( Fig 4B .3) the negative control FNAB tumor fragment has an increase in apoptotic cells at the periphery but with a majority of the cells within the FNAB tumor fragment being viable. The staurosporine treated sample on day 1 ( Fig 4C.1 ) is highly populated with green viable cells with a distinct subpopulation of apoptotic cells in the right periphery of the sample. At day 5 ( Fig 4C.3 ), the apoptotic subpopulation of cells seen in day 1 was lost and the majority of the viable cells seen in day 1, overtime, became apoptotic in day 5. Apoptotic cells at day 5 were located both in the periphery and the center of the FNAB tumor fragment. Fig 4B.2, 4B.4, 4C.2 and 4C.4 , show a histogram of the relative intensity values across both the x-axis and y-axis for each of the representative FNAB tumor fragments. Each spike in color is measured across the corresponding axis for an intensity value. On day 1, the negative control ( Fig 4B.2 ) had an average of 2500–3000 relative fluorescent units (RFUs) of green fluorescent protein (GFP) representing viability, Calcein AM staining, and 500–1000 RFUs of Texas Red (TR) representing apoptosis CF594-AnnexinV staining On day 5, the negative control group ( Fig 4B.4 ) still had an average 2500–3000 RFUs of GFP with an average of 1000–2000 RFUs of TR. The percent of apoptotic cells at day 1 for the negative control group was <5% of the total volume of the tumor compared to day 5 with 20% apoptotic cells. On day 1, the Staurosporine treated group ( Fig 4C.2 ) had an average 2000–2500 RFUs of GFP with an average of 500–1000 RFUs of TR. On day 5, the Staurosporine treated group ( Fig 4B.4 ) had an average 1000–2000 RFUs of GFP with an average of 2500–3000 RFUs of TR. The percent of apoptotic cells at day 1 for the Staurosporine treated group was <5% of the total volume of the tumor compared to day 5 with >70% of apoptotic cells.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169797.g004  Fig 4   Comparison of the calculated viability index of the tumor FNAB samples during 5 days of treatment.

Discussion  The aim of this work was to demonstrate that an engineered microfluidic device with the ability to trap FNAB tumor samples within a specifically spaced configuration of posts had the potential to maintain the viability of the tumor sample while supporting the integrity of the tumor microenvironment and thus support a more relevant and accurate assessment of drug response. The long-term goal is to use the device for personalized cancer therapy to determine the most effective drug and drug combinations for each patient. First, we validated the multi-physics model of fluid flow by quantitatively measuring the velocity within the channel of the device ( S1 Text ). Next, we used this data to extrapolate the shear stress on the FNAB tumor fragments in trap and concluded that with a flow rate of 125 μL/hr, tumor fragments that occluded less than 70% of the channel width experienced an average shear stress less than 0.4 dynes/cm 2 ; a shear stress below the physiological critical threshold of 0.4 dynes/cm2 [ 38 , 50 ], with the largest shear stress located on the posts ( S1 Text ). Next, we determined that the FNAB tumor fragments in trap experience full interstitial flow and therefore full drug perfusion demonstrated by the even distribution and uptake the drug, doxorubicin HCl, throughout the entire FNAB tumor fragment in channel. Additional findings further demonstrated even drug exposure upon delivery throughout the FNAB tumor fragments indicated by similar temporal activities such as nuclear fragmentation and the production of apoptotic bodies, indicative of apoptosis occurring throughout all areas of the sample. When we tested a larger molecule antibody for full sample perfusion, results were similar in showing penetration of the antibodies throughout the FNAB tumor fragments without nonspecific binding seen throughout the z-axis images. These findings are important for the indication of the microfluidic system having the diverse capability to evaluate for large molecule antibody based targeted therapies. Herein, we demonstrated a cytotoxic drug model using a known protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, [ 41 ] to optimize the microfluidic device towards a potential clinically relevant chemosensitivity assay. All FNAB tumor samples were assessed for their viability at the onset of each experiment before randomly assigned to a treatment group. With the onset of the 5-day experiment, samples with a baseline Vi < 0.9 were deemed necrotic or nonviable and were rejected from the experiment. For days 1 through 5, there was a significant difference in the viability over death between the non-treated and treated groups. Although, each FNAB tumor fragment showed slight variability within groups in how they responded to treatment over the course of 5 days, there was a significant difference with the change of viability and death over the course of 5 days for each FNAB tumor sample between the non-treated and treated groups. With the ability to evaluate viability and death in real-time, our platform affords the user to assess FNAB tumor samples at the onset of treatment and to evaluate its response to drug treatment overtime. Real-time monitoring of treatment is a powerful tool especially for drugs that may be cytostatic or when in combinatorial treatment with cell cycle inhibitors. Further, the platform presents the ability for users to assess different areas of the FNAB tumor sample and with coordinating protein markers such as EpCAM and CD44 to know which cells are undergoing cell death or continued viability and evasion of drug response.  The clinical process of deciding a chemotherapy regime is based on empirical information from clinical trials from patients which ignores biological individuality of the tumor [ 51 ]. Patient-to-patient response is variable with anti-cancer drugs showing a high degree of variation due to each individual patient's tumor being genotypically and phenotypically different [ 52 ]. For treatment regimens to be more effective and personalized to each patient, chemosensitivity assays need to be tailored to evaluate the patient's cancer and how it responds to chemotherapy. Personalized information can better assist doctors to select effective chemotherapy regimens for individual patients. Various chemosensitivity assays used in clinic have been comprehensively reviewed [ 11 , 12 ] but have been developed to assay chemosensitivity on an isolated subset of cells expanded from a tumor biopsy and cultured as a monolayer on a well plate. To accurately assess the efficacy of chemotherapy among patients, a physiologically meaningful model should be used that incorporates not only the cancer cells but also its microenvironment with its supporting stromal components. The platform must be stable with the culture environment well-defined.  Current chemosensitivity assays utilize cells cultured as a monolayer in two-dimensional models that lack the true representation of the three-dimensional microenvironment and cell to cell interactions seen in vivo. Cancer cells grown in three-dimensional environments often show more resistance to cytotoxic agents than those grown in two-dimensional cultures [ 8 ]. Formation of polarized, three-dimensional structures confers protection to cell death where in contrast, nonpolarized structures are sensitive to induction of apoptosis. Weaver et al. found that epithelial tumors that express 4-integrins have the potential to acquire resistance to exogenous death stimuli if they are given the appropriate spatial and biochemical cues from the microenvironment. Therefore, regardless of the genetic makeup, the rate of growth, or the malignant status, resistance correlates with ECM composition, hemidesmosome-dependent polarity, and nuclear factor kappa B activation [ 6 ].  A further drawback with in vitro chemosensitivity assays are the poorly defined culture conditions caused by chemical gradients in conventional static cell culture formats such as the well plate. In static well plate cell culture, support media is manually introduced or replaced periodically in a batch-wise manner. Such a nonhomogeneous and fluctuating culture environment may complicate the investigation and quantification of a cellular response to drug conditions as cellular physiology is fairly sensitive to the extracellular conditions [ 22 ]. A cell culture system using continuous fluid perfusion provides circulation of nutrients and waste maintaining a stable homogeneous culturing environment [ 13 , 53 ]. Secondly, three-dimensional models do not have a homogeneous microenvironment and therefore, culturing cells in three dimensions crucially perturbs the way the cells respond to chemotherapeutic agents [ 54 ]. In cases where the three-dimensional tissue’s radius exceeds 400 μm, concentration gradients are evident where the available oxygen, metabolites, or therapeutic agents form inward gradients while that of carbon dioxide or excreted cell waste, or the acidity of extracellular fluid form outward gradients [ 55 – 57 ]. These gradients, and the downstream consequences that follow them, form the basis for the increased drug resistance that may be observed specifically in three-dimensional system[ 58 ]. Importantly, such gradients do exist within in vivo tumor tissues, and they interfere with the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic treatment [ 58 ]. Additionally, cells in a two-dimensional model often experience shear stress that are non-physiological and are harmful for cell viability. Chang et al. found that incubation under static conditions for 24 or 48 hours led to G0/G1 arrest; in contrast, shear stress (12 dynes/cm2) induced G2/M arrest [ 37 ]. Specifically, induced shear stress increased expressions of cyclin B1 and p21CIP1 and decreased expressions of cyclins A, D1, and E, cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdk)-1, -2, -4, and -6, and p27KIP1 as well as a decrease in Cdk1 activity. Also, shear-induced sensitization directly correlates with the application of fluid shear stress, and TRAIL-induced apoptosis increases in a fluid shear stress force- and time-dependent manner that is caspase dependent [ 50 ]. Therefore, to accurately assess the efficacy of chemotherapy among patients, chemosensitivity assays need to be a physiologically meaningful model that are stable and well-defined incorporating a three-dimensional microenvironment with its ability to foster cell-to-cell interactions that play important roles to determine its cellular fate as they undergo proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis.  The concept of microfluidics offers a low volume, miniaturized method for culturing and studying cellular and tissue concepts in a stable, well-defined, and more biologically relevant culture environment. Conversely, more traditional methods of cell culturing such as well plate assays are relatively large in scale requiring several hundreds of microliters to milliliters in volume with a greater demand of reagents and requiring a larger sampling population cells and or tissue. With the progress in microfabrication and microfluidic technology, microfluidic systems have been progressively used as versatile cell culture tools for various research purposes. The application of microfluidic cell culture has particularly gained more interest for drug research. Current studies of cancer dynamics within microfluidic systems have principally focused on evaluating the steps involved in cancer cell metastasis, with a benefit of these studies being that these factors make ideal biomarkers in many instances. In such studies, tumor cells have been exposed to differing shear stresses and chemokine gradients, parameters that change in capillaries in vivo, to study factors thought to be involved in generating circulating tumor cells [ 59 , 60 ]. Others have examined the site of attachment and adhesion itself through the use of isotropic silicon microstructures and matrigel lined with human microvascular endothelial cells—highlighting the biomechanical properties of normal and cancer cells [ 61 , 62 ]. A third group of studies have examined cell deformability, to distinguish between normal, benign, and metastatic cancer cells using antibody-coated microchannels, to develop a test for metastatic disease [ 63 , 64 ]. Several of these research groups developed these microfluidic devices with chambers, posts, microbubble array, or microwells to analyze single cell behavior or trap cells in cluster, which would eventually grow into spheroids. Single cell two-dimensional models have their limitations and spheroids, although three-dimensional in conformation, rely on co-culturing cell lines that do not represent a model of personalized treatment for patients. Hattersley et al. successfully demonstrated the ability to model cell death by chemotherapeutic agents in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma biopsies although analysis was performed offline without real-time microscopic evaluation of the tumor microenvironment with dependency of dissemination and lysis of the biopsy sample [ 35 ].  Herein, we described a microfluidic platform with the ability to sustain FNAB tumor samples with full interstitial perfusion for the real-time monitoring of chemotherapy. The trapping posts within the device were strategically engineered to be spaced to retain the FNAB in channel during flow and to allow interstitial flow within the channel fostering full fluid perfusion of the FNAB tumor fragments; if spaced too wide the FNAB tumor sample would be lost in flow, if spaced too close back pressure would be created with most of the fluid traveling around the outside of the FNAB rather than interstitially through the FNAB tumor sample. Results from both the fluorescent bead assay in flow and the doxorubicin HCl drug perfusion study indicated that the FNAB tumor fragments are in close contact with the fluid front on all sides of the sample. The doxorubicin HCl drug perfusion experiment exemplifies advective properties with drug uptake throughout the whole sample in a simultaneous manner rather than as a progressive gradient in a diffusion manner with subsequent apoptotic events happening simultaneously throughout the entire sample. Additionally, the large molecule antibody experiment demonstrated antibodies bound to conjugate membrane proteins throughout the interior of the FNAB tumor samples shown through various z-axis images. These findings validate and further exemplify the advective properties of bulk fluid flow within the channel rather than dependence on diffusion alone. Traps engineered in other microfluidic devices have similar orientations but different dimensions and spacing that do not offer full interstitial flow and therefore resulting in chemical gradients therefore experiencing unstable nonhomogeneous microenvironments. Khoury et al. found that embryonic stem cell aggregates can asymmetrically differentiate in relation to their location within the microfluidic trap, and in close correlation with the state of the culture medium potentiating nutrient concentration gradients. Cells that were shielded from flow were exposed to lower nutrient levels and were most likely exposed to higher concentrations of excreted factors. Reduced nutrition and serum starvation has been shown to reduce proliferation rates and hinder cell cycle progression [ 65 ].  While two-dimensional cell culture models have their limitations, in vivo mouse models suffer the disadvantages of expense and the limitations of multiplexing for statistical relevance with unfavorable ethical concerns. Microfluidic devices have been widely used for investigation of cellular responses and viability. Microfluidic devices offer controlled environments for regulatory signals such as cytokines and physical factors like hydrodynamic shear with low burden on reagent use. Unlike a static cell culture, a perfusion cell culture model can provide a system for continuous nutrient supply and waste removal, thereby maintaining a more stable culture environment [ 14 , 22 ]. We have created a stable and quantifiable fluid delivery system that provides circulation found in the body with the relevant pressures and shear experienced by solid tumors in situ.    Conclusion  Herein we demonstrated a microfluidic device capable of trapping and maintaining the viability of FNAB tumor samples for the investigation of chemotherapy efficacy. We have shown that the fluid dynamics of the device operate at values that are physiologically relevant without insult or harm to the sample. Also, we demonstrated that the FNAB samples are fully exposed to drug infusion without the production of gradients so that a full and robust determination of drug effect may be ascertained from the viability results. Microfluidics can be a valuable tool for cancer investigation and ultimately clinicians in providing insight into the best treatment options tailored to each patient. The device has the potential to predict patient response before initiation of therapy that would help to design the most efficient therapeutic regimen for individual patients while sparing others who are not likely to benefit from the given therapy.

Nowadays, the growing computational capabilities of Cloud systems rely on the reduction of the consumed power of their data centers to make them sustainable and economically profitable. The efficient management of computing resources is at the heart of any energy-aware data center and of special relevance is the adaptation of its performance to workload. Intensive computing applications in diverse areas of science generate complex workload called workflows, whose successful management in terms of energy saving is still at its beginning. WorkflowSim is currently one of the most advanced simulators for research on workflows processing, offering advanced features such as task clustering and failure policies. In this work, an expected power-aware extension of WorkflowSim is presented. This new tool integrates a power model based on a computing-plus-communication design to allow the optimization of new management strategies in energy saving considering computing, reconfiguration and networks costs as well as quality of service, and it incorporates the preeminent strategy for on host energy saving: Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS). The simulator is designed to be consistent in different real scenarios and to include a wide repertory of DVFS governors. Results showing the validity of the simulator in terms of resources utilization, frequency and voltage scaling, power, energy and time saving are presented. Also, results achieved by the intra-host DVFS strategy with different governors are compared to those of the data center using a recent and successful DVFS-based inter-host scheduling strategy as overlapped mechanism to the DVFS intra-host technique.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003176  Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte    TEC2015-67387-C4-2      http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003176  Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte    TEC2012-38142- C04-03   This work was financially supported by Research Projects TEC2015-67387-C4-2 and TEC2012-38142- C04-03 (Spanish Education and Competitively Ministry, URL: http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es ).

Data centers are the backend computing infrastructures that make up Cloud systems whose performance have a significant economic and environmental impact. It is estimated that data centers consume around 1.5% of the world´s electricity and they are responsible for the emission of about 2% of the CO 2 worldwide with energy costs in an average data center doubling every five years [ 2 , 3 ]. Designing faster and more powerful data centers has been a priority in the information technology (IT) industry in the recent years. To this end, the number of resources working collaboratively has been increased and the associated processing capabilities have been improved, what has lead to an increment in the demanded power. Also, data centers need the support of auxiliary infrastructures such as cooling systems, variable-speeds drivers, temperature and humidity sets and power distribution units to maintain the servers farms. Furthermore, the storage, power distribution and cooling systems are generally over provisioned in order to ensure the reliability, what also increases energy consumption [ 4 ]. Hence, the crescent number of servers and auxiliary systems in data centers makes their overall performance cost and environmental impact to increase non-stop as these services are more and more demanded currently [ 5 – 7 ]. In this scenario, making energy saving a critical aspect to be aware of in the whole management of the Cloud systems is necessary to allow their growth in terms of sustainability and economic benefit.  Green Cloud Computing is intended to provide users with the same quality of service requirements as Cloud Computing but lowering data centers power consumption through a more efficient use of their resources [ 3 ]. The efficiency of data centers generally falls into four main types: power infrastructure, cooling, airflow management and IT efficiency [ 8 , 9 ]. Improving data centers through IT involves using more adequate servers, networks and data storage resources as well as managing these servers, networks and storage systems more efficiently. Particularly, job scheduling is at the core of the successful power management in Cloud Computing and there is a main strategy for reducing energy consumption: Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), which allows to dynamically adapt the machines performance to the changing conditions of the workload [ 2 ]. DVFS technique cannot only be applied for intra-host energy saving but for inter-host energy saving, such as in the recent and successfull DVFS-based scheduling mechanims described in [ 10 – 13 ]. The application of DVFS is being studied in sequential workload execution. However, its application and analysis in other industrial, business and scientific applications of Cloud Computing is still in an initial stage, such as the case of workflows or workload where the different jobs are interrelated and complex dependencies must be considered.  The computation of workflows extracted from large scale data and computation intensive applications is extensively used by prestigious scientific institutions nowadays in many science and technology fields [ 14 , 15 ]. The bioinformatics project at Harvard University is a relevant example, which conducts a wide search for small untranslated RNAs (sRNAs) that rule diverse processes such as secretion or virulence in bacteria [ 16 ]. Also, it is worth mentioning the applications of workflows in astronomy such as Montage engine, promoted by NASA’s Earth Sciences Technology Office to generate science mosaics combining diverse images from the sky [ 17 ]. A current challenge is how to manage these workflows in Cloud Computing in an efficient way in the sense of energy consumption and new strategies are being proposed. Conducting experiments with real data centers implies several difficulties. On the one hand, a considerable investment must be done to deploy the real computational infrastructures associated to Cloud systems and on the other hand, the energy associated costs to run extensive workflow applications, which may make prohibitive the research for the major part of institutions. Simulators allow to perform experiments with real scenarios both in terms of supporting infrastructures as well as of workload without the need for any specific physical equipment or networks. This way, the availability of sophisticated simulators is relevant in the study of new green strategies for management in Cloud Computing [ 18 ].  In this work, a new Cloud Computing simulator is proposed: WorkflowSim-DVFS. This software tool is an expected energy-aware extension of the WorkflowSim simulator based on Java [ 19 , 20 ], which incorporates the Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling technique [ 21 – 23 ] in a way that real workflows can be processed considering a regulation of the voltage and frequency in the computing resources as done in current CPUs. It must be underlined that WorkflowSim is the only Cloud Computing simulator nowadays that allows the execution of real workflows considering the event of failures and different amount of workload in each server [ 19 ]. Now, this work allows this simulator to be energy-aware providing a computing-plus-communication power model that considers computing, reconfiguration and network costs [ 10 – 13 ] and incorporating five different DVFS governors. To validate the simulator, experiments are conducted in different real scenarios and performance is discussed considering both the results of the DVFS intra-host governors and the results of a recent DVFS-based inter-host scheduling strategy used as an overlapped mechanism to the DVFS intra-host governors to increase energy saving [ 10 – 13 ]. The simulator is offered as an open source tool and it has been made available from the GitHub repository [ 24 ]. Hence, this work represents a further effort to support research on Green Cloud Computing systems.  This paper is organized as follows. First, in “Material and Methods” the definition of the problem and the related works in the field of power-aware and workflows simulators in Cloud Computing are introduced followed by the motivation of this work. Next, the proposed simulator allowing the energy analysis and optimization as well as the DVFS management of workflows in Cloud Computing is presented in this section. In “Experimental Evaluation and Discussion” experimental results considering diverse scenarios are analyzed to evaluate the simulator. Governors are tested when used uniquely as intra-host strategies for energy saving and when they are also used in inter-host DVFS-based scheduling strategies. Finally, the main conclusions of the work are drawn in “Conclusions”.    Materials and Methods   Definition of the Problem  The problem in hand in this work is to offer an easy, realistic and open source simulator to help research on energy optimization in Clouds running workflows. The specific aspects of this problem can be summarized as follows:    The simulator must provide DVFS capabilities controled by the main types of governors to Cloud data centers. DVFS [ 2 ] is a key strategy for energy optimization in Cloud Computing, as shown by the current emergence of many energy optimization strategies that are being developed considering DVFS-enabled networked data centers (e.g., jobs scheduling [ 10 – 13 ]). In essence, DVFS is a technique that, based on the type of governor, adjusts frequency levels of processing elements according to the amount of workload to be executed. This is translated in an adjustable power capability for these systems. High performance of the processors, generally measured in millions of instructions per second (MIPS), are obtained using high powers and used at the event of high levels of workload, whereas low performance can be provided in low workload states with the associated power reduction. DVFS is included in many current computing systems such as the Linux kernel and it is generally not considered a substitute of other strategies for energy optimization, but a background intra-host tool supporting the design of new strategies for energy saving in data centers. The simulator must include the main different types of DVFS governors which can be classified into static and dynamic.    The second main aspect of the problem is to offer a simulator able to estimate the energy, and related parameters, of the Cloud. Once the execution of the workload has finished, it must offer an estimation of the overall and average power and consumed energy as well as of makespan. If a simulator cannot provide an estimation of these parameters, it is not possible to inform the Cloud administrator or user about the performance of the designed system and in this way, the strategies for energy saving cannot be analyzed and improved. To solve this problem, it is necessary to adopt a realistic model and integrate it in the simulator. Furthermore, it is relevant that the power model does not only consider the computing cost of the processing elements but also, the reconfiguration consumption in dynamic DVFS governors and the network costs, as recent and successful works in Cloud Computing propose [ 10 – 13 ].    The simulator must be able to simulate traces that represent a real processing in Clouds. If the tasks of the workload are randomly generated, the execution of these tasks in the simulator does not correspond to a real execution of workload in a Cloud data center and thus, the performance of the systems indicated by the simulator would not be close to real-world results in many problems. In this work, the simulation of workflows is considered. The ability to process workflows is useful to simulate traces that reproduce real workload in many real systems. Workflows determine the order in which tasks must be processed, including constrains that avoid that tasks are processed before their parent tasks, and the inputs and outputs results that must be considered for each task. This assures that tasks are processed following a predefined order with the associated input and output. Furthermore, the simulator must be able to execute real traces instead of series of random tasks, what helps in providing a realistic tool for optimization in Cloud environments.    Also, the simulator must offer task clustering, events of tasks failures and overheads and policies for the management of these failures. Hence, the realism of the simulator must not only be based on power capabilities for optimization and processing of real workloads but also, advanced techniques in Cloud Computing for the network management must be integrated.    Finally, the simulator must be open source software. It is intended that the simulator constitutes a free available tool for the research community, in a way that further improvements in energy saving through the design of new strategies based on DVFS-enabled networks can be achieved more easily. Also, this simulator could be enhanced by researchers in different topics of Cloud management (e.g., security or interconnection among Clouds).    In the next section, the different types of power-aware simulators for Cloud Computing are analyzed and discussed to finally present the motivations of the suggested proposal in this work.    Related Works and Motivation of the Proposal  In the last years the development of simulators for Cloud Computing has experienced a great evolution in a parallel way to the expansion of Cloud systems in both industrial and scientific fields. Particularly, in this section it is important to study those simulators that present capabilities related to workflow management and energy efficiency.  In [ 25 ], B. Aksanli et al. present a comparative study of data centers simulators supporting energy simulations to finally focus on the GENSim simulator, the only data centers simulator able to estimate the impact of the allocation of services and batch jobs on a single server. Results in this work demonstrate that green energy forecasting can improve overall energetic efficiency in a data center. However, this simulator does not support simulations of Virtual Machines (VMs), it does not implement DVFS and it does not support the execution of workflows.  The work presented in [ 26 ] performs a comparison between existing Cloud simulators and it proposes the GreenCloud simulator. GreenCloud is an extension of the well-known ns-2 network simulator, able to offer details of energy consumption in networks links, routers and servers and including two strategies for on host energy saving: Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) that allows decreasing voltage of switches and Dynamic Network Shutdown (DNS) to perform an ON/OFF strategy. Also, it offers an accurate analysis of communications at the TCP level. However, this simulator is not an open source tool and thus, the accessibility for researchers and the flexibility to introduce new strategies for the Cloud management decreases significantly [ 19 ].  CloudSim [ 18 ] is an open source Cloud Computing simulator written on Java that allows modeling Cloud infrastructure and services supporting the execution of sequential workloads. It provides a simple model of execution of tasks (no possibility of workflows simulation) and it does not consider the dependence among these tasks or task clustering. Also, it does not contemplate the occurrence of faults or overheads. Thus, this simulator is based on some simplifications that do not conform to the actual dynamic environment of distributed Cloud systems and to the evolution of new management techniques for workflows. Furthermore, it does not offer energy-aware capabilities such as DVFS or DNS.  W. Chen and E. Deelman [ 27 ] presented an extension of CloudSim called WorkflowSim that allows the execution of workflows. WorkflowSim implements a layer for managing execution of workloads with dependencies. It also offers other features such as the grouping of tasks or clustering where small tasks on large jobs are linked to reduce overloads. Further, it allows experiments with real workflows described in DAX format or Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in XML format [ 28 ], used by the Pegasus system [ 28 ] workflows in a way that new scheduling algorithms can be validated in realistic scenarios. WorkflowSim also allows mechanisms for fault simulation in task execution and moreover, it implements policies for the management of these failures. However, it does not have any characteristics for energy saving or analysis.  T. Guérout et al. [ 29 ] extended CloudSim to implement DVFS into CloudSim and to include tools to estimate power and energy consumption. Also, the simulator considers the execution of workflows modeled as DAGs. In the same way, F. Cao et al. [ 30 ] also propose a simulator including DAG workflows and DVFS to obtain the optimum frequency without mentioning the implemented governors and associated possible configurations and no source code is made available. However, in both previous works it cannot be assured that the obtained simulations can describe a behavior alike a real data center since they do not incorporate fault simulation in tasks execution and overheads, which are essential to accurately simulate workload execution in the ever-changing computing environment of Clouds. Furthermore, the power model only considers the computing cost of the processing elements and it is not aware of the reconfiguration of frequencies and network costs. Thereby, many recent DVFS-based scheduling strategies cannot be implemented in these simulators [ 10 – 13 ].  After studying the current available Cloud simulators above, it is appreciated that there does not exist a platform that meets all the requirements presented in the problem definition. However, WorkflowSim, even though it does not cover all the requirements, could offer a whole solution to the problem if it could integrate DVFS governors and a power model considering the computing, reconfiguration of frequencies and network costs. As introduced before, WorkflowSim is an open source simulator able to process workflows and providing capabilities for task clustering, event of tasks failure and overheads and policies for management of these failures and so, the incorporation of DVFS governors and a computing-plus-communication power model could make of it a complete solution to the problem. Hence, it is proposed in this work to extend WorkflowSim to become power-aware and integrate DVFS models that have been experimentally validated in real hosts [ 29 ]. This offers a realistic and open source tool for further research on Green Cloud Computing in which energy consumption can be estimated and the experiments are based on real workflows. Moreover, the simulator offers a platform for research on DVFS-enabled data centers. Since modern CPUs already include DVFS techniques, it is important that the simulator can include this technique so that the CPUs dynamic power changes can be considered in the whole energy estimation and implementation of DVFS-based optimization strategies as in real world. In this way, with WorkflowSim-DVFS, recent and successfull DVFS-based scheduling algorithms [ 10 – 13 ] can be simulated and optimized based on the power consumption estimation of computing, reconfiguration and network costs, at the same time task clustering, event of tasks failure and overheads and policies for management of these failures are also offered. Hence, energy-aware capabilities are introduced to one of the most realistic Cloud simulators nowadays and the code is made available for the research community. This work represents an expected new effort to offer accurate energy-aware simulators of real workflows in Cloud Computing [ 19 ].    Proposed Energy-Aware Simulator for Real Workflows Management: WorkflowSim-DVFS  The proposed simulator includes the DVFS technique with diverse governors as in modern CPUs nowadays, and it is able to estimate the power consumption of the processing of real workflows. The incorporation of these features in WorkflowSim is explained in this section.   DVFS for real workflows processing and computing cost model  The methods for energy saving in data centers can be classified into host (or intra-host) and network (or inter-host) levels. Whereas the network level energy-aware methods are essentially founded on the coordination and cooperation of machines through scheduling processes to reduce power consumption, the host level ones are devoted to increase inside-machine efficiency. This work focuses on the study and implementation of the host energy-aware DVFS technique for real Cloud simulators. DVFS offers an efficient and gradual way to reduce the dissipated power in a processor by adjusting its clock speed and the supplied voltage during both phases of idleness and intensive computing in applications execution. Using this technique large reductions in power consumption with a very slight loss of efficiency in its performance are achieved. Different high performance computing platforms based on data centers such as cluster computing and supercomputing apply DVFS technologies to reduce power consumption and to get a high reliability and availability in their infrastructures [ 21 – 23 ]. Furthermore, currently the CPUs market provides such technologies, as is the case of Intel’s SpeedStep and AMD’s PowerNow!. These CPUs are able to dynamically vary their voltage and frequency to adapt to the workload, mainly trying to reduce energy consumption but, generally, also avoiding a delay in the execution.  In the Linux kernel, DVFS can be ruled by different types of governors. Governors are core models that can manage the operation points both in frequency and voltage based on an algorithm. Currently, there exist five types of DVFS governors:    Performance: it sets the frequency in a static way to the greater available CPU frequency.    Powersave: it sets the frequency in a static way to the lowest available CPU frequency.    Userspace: it sets frequency according to a user program.    On demand: it makes an adjustment of frequency based on the utilization of the CPU and a predefined utilization threshold.    Conservative: it is a conservative approach of the previous On demand governor. It also makes an adjustment of frequency based on the utilization of the CPU, but in a more gradual way.    While basic governors such as Performance and Powersave use a fixed frequency, more complex governors are based on thresholds and voltage and frequency are varied based on the current utilization respect to the configured threshold. This is the case of On demand and Conservative governors, where voltage and frequency are reduced when the utilization is low and increased when the utilization is high, what is translated into energy saving.  In DVFS, the dependence of the computing power of a processing element with voltage and frequency is given by the following expression [ 31 ]: P  V  ,  f  =  a  C  V  2  f  (1) where V represents the voltage, f indicates the frequency and a and C are constants or frequency multipliers. A CPU can work at a certain number of different frequencies depending on the multipliers a and C , and voltage is scaled with the frequency. Lower voltage implies that lower frequencies can be selected on the CPU, as both parameters are interrelated. From this expression it can be derived that the more voltage and frequency decrease, the less computing power is consumed.  In order to analyze the performance of DVFS in simulators in terms of power saving, a computing power model that estimates the power consumption based on a real CPUs behavior is necessary. High-level approaches increase the portability and speed in simulations in contrast to more complex models that consider low-level aspects of the computing platform and offer a more accurate CPU computing cost. In this way, for simulation, high-level models are generally considered. Following the approach of T. Guérout et al. [ 29 ], the overall computing power consumed by the CPU, P total ( α , V , f ), is given by a linear relation of the CPU’s utilization rate ( α ) and the associated power consumption of the CPU when α = 0 and α = 1, P idle ( V , f ) and P full ( V , f ), respectively: P  t  o  t  a  l  α  ,  V  ,  f  =  P  i  d  l  e  V  ,  f  +  P  f  u  l  l  V  ,  f  -  P  i  d  l  e  V  ,  f  α  (2) where α is the utilization rate of the CPU, a real number in the range [0, 1], being α = 0 the case when the machine is in the lowest performance state (i.e., idle state) and the associated power consumption is P idle ( V , f ), whereas α = 1 is the case when the machine is in the highest performance state (i.e., full state) during the processing of workload and the associated power consumption is P full ( V , f ). Considering the relation of frequency f and voltage V of a CPU with multipliers C and a introduced in Eq 1 , P idle ( V , f ) and P full ( V , f ) can be calculated. On the one hand, for the idle state (i.e., α = 0) the power consumption P idle ( V , f ) can be expressed as: P  0  ,  V  ,  f  =  P  i  d  l  e  V  ,  f  =  a  C  V  i  d  l  e  2  f  i  d  l  e  (3) where V idle and f idle denote the voltage V and frequency f when the CPU is in the idle state, respectively. On the other hand, the expression for power in the full state (i.e., α = 1) P full ( V , f ) corresponds to: P  1  ,  V  ,  f  =  P  f  u  l  l  V  ,  f  =  a  C  V  f  u  l  l  2  f  f  u  l  l  (4) where V full and f full denote the voltage V and frequency f when the CPU is in the full state, respectively. The utilization rate α is also used in DVFS to check the thresholds of the considered governors and it represents the scale in frequency f and voltage V in Eq 1 . The integration of DVFS in WorkflowSim is relevant to allow on host energy optimization through CPU’s dynamic performance.    WorkflowSim-DVFS entities fundamentals  WorkflowSim extends CloudSim to process DAXs workflows or workloads where tasks have complex dependencies. As an example, Figs 1 , 2 and 3 graphically show three workflows corresponding to real traces from Montage (25 jobs), Inspiral (30 jobs) and Sipht (30 jobs) projects [ 16 ], respectively, where the type of jobs and dependences can be observed.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g001  Fig 1   Montage Workflow DAX (25 jobs) example.      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g002  Fig 2   Inspiral Workflow DAX (30 jobs) example.      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g003  Fig 3   Sipht Workflow DAX (30 jobs) example.     Five main entities conduct the management of the workload in WorkflowsSim-DVFS: the Planner, the Merger, the Engine, the Scheduler and the Datacenter. The Planner is the entity that initializes the system and parses the DAX file to get the individuals tasks called Cloudlets. Then, those tasks are sent to the Merger (also called Clustering Engine) that groups the different tasks into jobs (i.e., collection of tasks). The default configuration of the simulator leaves no clustering performed, it just gets each task into a job individually. Next, the jobs are sent to the Engine, where they are selected following the order specified by the workflow. The Engine is the entity in charge of making sure the workflow’s order is followed, and sending to the Scheduler the tasks that can be processed each time a task is returned, being these tasks those whose parent nodes have already been processed. Finally, the Scheduler selects which VM of the Datacenter is the most suitable for processing each task. Communications are grouped in three stages: Initialization stage, Main stage and Ending stage. Figs 4 , 5 and 6 graphically represent the messages exchange between these entities in each stage, respectively.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g004  Fig 4   WorkflowSim messages—Initialization stage.      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g005  Fig 5   WorkflowSim messages—Main stage.      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g006  Fig 6   WorkflowSim messages—Ending stage.     The process for the main stage is repeated each time the Datacenter entity finishes processing a task. It must be noted that to make this execution close to the behavior of a real and power-aware data center using workflows, the Scheduler must not only be able to use information related to execution times but also, power and energy parameters, and furthermore, the hosts within the Datacenter must include DVFS govenors.    Computing-plus-communication power model for real workflows processing  The integrated computing power model in our simulator describes how power varies with frequency in a real processor with DVFS following the approach in [ 29 ] as introduced in the previous section. In this computing power model ( Eq 2 ) consumed power of the processing elements varies depending on frequency, and the values of frequency that a processor can work with are obtained multiplying the mother board’s base frequency by the processor’s frequency multiplier, so that the different available frequency values are discrete. Table 1 presents a real example of the possible frequencies and associated frequency multipliers of a real processor (CPU Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q6700 @ 2.66GHz with 4GB Ram).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.t001  Table 1   DVFS parameters of a CPU Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q6700 @ 2.66GHz with 4GB Ram for the computing power model: Frequency, frequency index, base frequency multiplier, performance in MIPS and power in full and idle states for the corresponding frequency.                Frequency (GHz)  1.600  1.867  2.113  2.400  2.670    Frequency index  0  1  2  3  4    Base frequency (2.670 GHz) multiplier  59.925  69.93  79.89  89.89  100    Performance (MIPS)  898.875  1048.95  1198.35  1348.35  1500    Null utilization, P idle (W)  82.75  82.85  85.95  83.10  83.25    Full utilization, P full (W)  88.77  92.00  95.5  99.45  103.0       As shown in Table 1 , the possible discrete frequencies for this processor are 2.670 GHz, 2.400 GHz, 2.113 GHz, 1.867 GHz and 1.600 GHz, which are the corresponding values of the multiplication of the base frequency (2.670 GHz) by the base frequency multipliers (i.e., 100, 89.89, 79.89, 69.93 and 59.875, respectively). Also, as it can be observed in Table 1 , each frequency is associated to a performance value in MIPS for the processing element. Specifically, the proposed computing model ( Eq 2 ) depends on the required power of the processing element in the full and idle states, P full and P idle , respectively, for the corresponding working frequency. Finally, Eq 2 depends on the utilization rate α . Hence, dynamic DVFS governors must select the most convenient frequency on their criteria to execute workload and so forth, the corresponding performance in term of MIPS and the associated P full and P idle values. In this way, dynamic governors are responsible for comparing the current utilization α to predefined thresholds of utilization to know whether the processing element needs higher performance (MIPS) or, on the contrary, the processor is rather idle and it can be scaled down to save unused power. For instance, let a certain processing element in the simulator to be working at frequency 2.400 GHz (frequency index 3 and base frequency multiplier 89.89) and consequently, the processing element performance in terms of MIPS is 1348.35, P full = 99.45 W and P idle = 83.10 W . When the utilization of machine α is checked, it is observed that its current value is 0.8. Hence, the current computing power of the processing element can be calculated, following Eq 2 , as: P  t  o  t  a  l  α  ,  V  ,  f  =  P  i  d  l  e  V  ,  f  +  P  f  u  l  l  V  ,  f  -  P  i  d  l  e  V  ,  f  α  =  83  .  10  W  +  [  99  .  45  W  -  83  .  10  W  ]  0  .  8  =  96  .  18  W  (5)  In the simulations in this work, as proposed in [ 29 ], the type of processing elements used is CPU Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q6700 @ 2.66GHz with 4GB Ram. The power values are measured using a plogg wireless electricity meter. Of course, power consumption can be measured in the physical processor, but in the simulator, this power model works with linear interpolation based on the real values P full and P idle for each frequency, estimating the power depending on the utilization rate α as indicated in Eq 2 .  Finally, the computing-plus-communication power model of the simulator adds the reconfiguration of frequencies and network costs to the studied computing cost as proposed in [ 10 – 13 ]. The specific values for the experimental evaluation are introduced in “Experimental Evaluation and Discussion”.    Entities communications for workflows processing  The entities messages in the proposed simulator are not modified from the previous simulator WorkflowSim. However, since the proposed simulator is power aware, the steps involving Tag 41 change considerably. Tag 41 is the simulator state message that appears at the end of the initialization and main stages in WorkflowSim-DVFS. The appearance of this message means that, if the selected governor for the processing elements is dynamic (i.e., OnDemand or Conservative), the utilization of the processing element must be compared to the predefined utilization threshold of the governor in order to adapt its frequency and so forth, its performance in terms of MIPS to the current workload conditions. This update process is performed in a recurrent way every time Tag 41 state message appears in the system. The checking interval parameter set in the Datacenter creation is the lapse of time between these messages. The default value for the checking interval is 0.01 s. Thus, each 0.01 s the simulator throws a Tag 41 message. This indicates how often the Datacenter checks the utilization of processing elements with dynamic governors and it applies the DVFS algorithm to determine whether the Datacenter is idle and the processing elements performance must be scaled down to save energy or, on the contrary, the utilization of the processing elements is too high that surpasses by excess the threshold and the system needs to be scaled up to increase its performance. For instance, for a Cloudlet being processed for 11 s, the number of messages with Tag 41 that the simulator produces is 1100, considering the default value of the checking interval set to 0.01 s. Similarly to WorkflowSim, the main stage process is repeated each time the Datacenter has finished processing a Cloudlet. The Engine then checks whether some new Cloudlets could be executed, it sends them to the Scheduler which in turn, takes decision related to VMs and sends them to be processed. Whenever the simulation receives a Tag 41 message, the governors of the processing elements check (for those using dynamic governors) the relation between the utilization threshold and the utilization of the processing elements. In this step, also the power consumption in the simulator is updated.  Finally, in Algorithm 1, the performance of the proposed simulator WorkflowSim-DVFS is formally presented using pseudo-code and each step is explained. For further details, the full code is available in [ 24 ].

Performance is analyzed in terms of time, power and energy and results are compared and discussed for different governors in DVFS. Also, the evolution of CPU utilization, frequency indexes and computing power along workflows processing are studied.   Scenarios  The simulator has been tested using twelve different real workflows, from Montage, Inspiral and Sipht scientific projects [ 16 , 32 ]. The characteristics of these workflows and considered network topology to test the simulator are presented as follows.   Workload description  Montage workflows : As introduced before, Montage [ 16 , 32 ] is an open source toolkit developed by the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive to create custom mosaics of the sky in astronomy through input images in FITS format. The number of jobs that are involved in a Montage workflow is a function of the number of input images to make up the final mosaic of the sky area in a way that, the more retrieved images, the more involved jobs. Fig 1 represents a Montage workflow of 25 jobs. It can be observed 9 sorts of jobs related to a level of execution. Hence, mProjectPP jobs correspond to processing level 1 and mJPEG jobs correspond to processing level 9. In this work traces from Montage project with 25, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs are considered in a way that the simulator is evaluated in the conditions of low, medium and high load.  Inspiral workflows : Inspiral workflows are retrieved from The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) [ 16 , 32 ]. The aim of this observatory is to identify gravitational waves originated by diverse phenomena in the universe on the basis of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Specifically, the LIGO Inspiral workflows are applied to study the data collected from the combination of compact binary systems (e.g., binary neutron stars and black holes) and they are made up of four different types of jobs. An example of an Inspiral workflow structure involving 30 jobs can be observed in Fig 2 . To test the proposed simulator, four different traces with 30, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs are processed.  Sipht workflows : The origin of Sipht workflows lies in a bioinformatics project conducted at Harvard University to found small untranslated RNAs or sRNA that rule diverse processes as secretion or virulence in bacteria. In order to help sRNA search, the high-throughput technology SIPHT program was developed [ 16 , 32 ]. To be precise, this program helps to automatize the identification of sRNA encoding genes for the bacterial samples in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Sipht workflows consist of 13 types of jobs as shown in Fig 3 . As in the previous cases, four traces grouping 30, 60, 100 and 1000 jobs are considered to evaluate the simulator.    Network Topology  The network topology in this work considers 20 hosts, each of them consisting of 1 processing element (PE) of 1500 MIPS. In these hosts, 20 VMs are created, each one with a performance of 1000 MIPS. It must be underlined that a main goal here is to validate the performance of the DVFS algorithm in the simulator, and thus, the critical parameters are the different frequency index values and the maximum MIPS assigned to machines. The maximum value of performance in MIPS cannot be set to an arbitrary value. A too high value of MIPS would make that, even though the frequency multiplier determined by a dynamic governor is scaled down to its minimum, the utilization would never surpass the utilization threshold and the system would always remain in the lowest frequency, making it not possible to observe the DVFS dynamic behavior. On the contrary, if the value of the maximum MIPS value is set too low, then the frequency multiplier would never be scaled down, as the utilization would always be higher than the utilization threshold and the maximum frequency multiplier would always be applied. With the values indicated before, a balance of these parameters is obtained allowing to evaluate the DVFS behavior with the dynamic governors.  Also, it must highlighted here that all the simulations in this work are conducted considering Intel (R) Core (TM) 2 Quad CPU Q6700@2.66 GHz with 4 GB of RAM memory hosts, with the power model for the processing cost ( Eq 2 ) using the real measured values of P Idle and P Full for each frequency ( Table 1 ), and that the models for the different DVFS governors follow the design validated in [ 29 ]. Hence, since the belonging of jobs to a determined workflow (as in the presented simulator) does not change its processing within a host, the computing power cost and the behavior of the different DVFS governors in the proposed simulator have been validated using a real system and further details can be found in [ 29 ].     Utilization of machine, frequency index and computing power evolution over time  This section analyses the evolution through time of the three main parameters in the DVFS computing model: utilization of machine, frequency index and computing power consumption. The purpose is to justify the right performance of the DVFS strategy in the simulator. To avoid a large number of data for the presented graphs, Montage workflow with 25 jobs is considered in this section to show the behavior of the DVFS strategy. Since the use of a static governor does not involve any adjustments in the frequency (or frequency index and multiplier) when the predefined utilization thresholds are exceeded, consumed computing power only varies with the utilization of the machine following Eq 2 , with fixed values for P full and P idle and a constant value for utilization of machine and frequency is obtained. In this way, in order to show the dynamic adjustment of the frequency in the simulator, dynamic governors performance is analyzed. Specifically, since OnDemand and Conservative governors essentially differs in the considered criteria for the selection of thresholds, OnDemand governor is analyzed.  The performance of the OnDemand governor depends on two configuration parameters: the utilization threshold α th and the sampling down factor s down . The utilization threshold α th is the value of utilization α which, if surpassed by excess or default, makes the governor change the working frequency of the processing element (or, equivalently, the frequency index and multiplier) and so forth, the values for P full and P idle and performance in MIPS. The sampling down factor s down represents a number of iterations or utilization checking time interval that the governor must wait to scale the working frequency down to the following lower frequency. Whenever the utilization of the processing element α surpasses by excess the utilization threshold α th (i.e., α > α th ), the governor decides that the performance of the processing element should be increased to accelerate the processing of tasks, and it sets the processor frequency (or, equivalently, the frequency index and multiplier) to the highest value, so that the performance in MIPS is set to its maximum. Once the processing element reaches the highest performance rate, the governor waits s down iterations to check again its utilization. If the utilization is lower than α th , the working frequency descends one level. This process is repeated until the utilization α is increased over the threshold α th , what increments the processor frequency (or, equivalently, the frequency index and multiplier) to its maximum once again. Once the processing element has reached the highest performance rate, the frequency drop process is restarted. Figs 7 , 8 and 9 , represent the utilization of the processing element α , the frequency index and the consumed computing power P total during the simulation using an OnDemand governor, respectively.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g007  Fig 7   Processing element utilization evolution through time with OnDemand governor.      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g008  Fig 8   Frequency index evolution through time with OnDemand governor.      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g009  Fig 9   Computing power evolution through time with OnDemand governor.     In the simulations corresponding to Figs 7 , 8 and 9 , α th = 0.95 and s down = 100 iterations. As it can be observed in Figs 7 and 8 , at the beginning of the simulation the utilization of the processing element is α = 0.6 and the frequency index is 4 (corresponding to 2.670 GHz as indicated in Table 1 ) what corresponds to a power consumption, as shown in Fig 9 , that has been calculated as: P  t  o  t  a  l  α  ,  V  ,  f  =  P  i  d  l  e  V  ,  f  +  P  f  u  l  l  V  ,  f  -  P  i  d  l  e  V  ,  f  α  =  83  .  25  W  +  [  103  .  00  W  -  83  .  25  W  ]  0  .  6  =  95  .  1  W  (6) where the values for P idle and P full are obtained from Table 1 . In the following seconds of the simulation, it can be observed that the utilization of the processing element α increases gradually (see Fig 7 ) until α th is surpassed by excess. In a parallel way, meanwhile α < α th the utilization of the processing element α is checked every s down iterations and given that α th is not exceeded, the frequency index is scaled down to the following lower value gradually (i.e., 3, 2, 1 and 0) and so, the power consumption decreases, as the values for P idle and P full are reduced accordingly to the frequency index, as presented in Table 1 . Once the utilization α is greater than α th when it is checked, the frequency index is scaled up to the maximum again (i.e., 4 corresponding to a 2.670 GHz frequency, Fig 8 ) and the power consumption increases as it can be observed in Fig 9 . Hence, it is shown how at the beginning of the simulation the frequency index was set to its maximum (i.e., 4) and that the current load of jobs means an utilization of 0.6, and power of 95.1 W. After 100 iterations, the utilization is checked and as its value is just 0.6, which is lower than 0.95, the frequency index is reduced to 3. The process is repeated until the frequency index is reduced to 1, when the utilization is increased over 0.95 and the DVFS governor sets the multiplier back to 4. As it has been shown, the frequency indexes are set to their maximum whenever the utilization exceeds the threshold α th , and scaled down to save power when it is below, in a gradual way. This method to scale the consumption and performance of the processing elements using OnDemand governor can be considered a double-edged sword. Higher frequencies means more MIPS, what ensures that there is no an unnecessary delay in the jobs execution, but the power consumption is higher, what could be inefficient if the utilization is not high enough. Analogously, a lower value of the frequency reduces power, but the governor must be sure that the utilization rate does not reach 1 with a low frequency index, as that would mean that the jobs would be delayed unnecessarily.    Time, power and energy global analysis  The implemented governors, Performance, PowerSave, OnDemand and Conservative, are tested processing the twelve different workloads presented in the scenario description: Montage (25, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs), Inspiral (30, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs) and Sipht (30, 60, 100 and 1000 jobs) workflows. The UserSpace governor is not used in the comparison, as its behavior depends on a arbitrary frequency selection by the user. Specifically, four parameters are analyzed to discuss the benefits of each of the DVFS governors: time, overall power consumption, average power consumption and energy. Furthermore, the results of the implemented DVFS governors with a static data center scheduling model (i.e., only DVFS intra-host strategies for energy saving are introduced) are compared to those of the governors when the scheduling in the data center considers a DVFS-based scheduling strategy for energy optimization (i.e., both DVFS intra-host and DVFS inter-host strategies are considered for energy saving simultaneously). As DVFS-based scheduling strategy, the recent and successfull adaptive online energy-aware scheduling strategy presented in [ 10 – 12 ] is implemented, which constitutes an updated version of [ 13 ]. This scheduler is based on a computing-plus-communication optimization model which tries to minimize on a per-job basis the overall resulting processing energy. The computing-plus-communication strategy can be formally expressed as: min  ∑  i  =  1  M  ε  C  P  U  (  i  )  +  ∑  i  =  1  M  ε  R  e  c  o  n  f  (  i  )  +  ∑  i  =  1  M  ε  n  e  t  (  i  )  (7) where ε CPU ( i ), ε Reconf ( i ) and ε net ( i ) are the energy values associated to the computing, the frequency reconfiguration and the communication costs, respectively, of the i th virtual machine VM ( i ) with i = 1, …, M being M the total number of virtual machines. The computational cost ε CPU ( i ) is defined as: ε  C  P  U  (  i  )  =  P  i  ,  t  o  t  a  l  α  ,  V  ,  f  ·  t  (  i  )  (8) with P i , total ( α , V , f ) represents the power of virtual machine VM ( i ) as explained in Eq 2 and t ( i ) is the time when the VM ( i ) operates with power P i , total ( α , V , f ). The frequency reconfiguration cost ε Reconf ( i ) represents the cost of changing the switching among discrete frequencies of VM ( i ). Two costs must be considered: internal switching cost and external switching cost. The first one is the cost of changing the internal-switching among discrete frequencies of VM ( i ) from f j ( i ) to f j + k ( i ) where j is the number of the discrete frequency in the range j = 0, …, Q and k represents the number of steps movements to reach the next active discrete frequency of the K possible, k = 1, …, K . The second one is the cost for external-switching from the final active discrete frequency of VM ( i ) at the end of a job to the next incoming job. The reconfiguration cost is defined as the sum of these two terms: ε  R  e  c  o  n  f  (  i  )  =  k  e  ∑  k  =  0  K  Δ  f  k  (  i  )  2  +  k  e  E  x  t  C  o  s  t  (9) being k e [ Joules / Hz 2 ] the reconfiguration cost induced by a unit size frequency switching, Δ f k ( i ) = f k +1 ( i ) − f k ( i ), and ExtCost the quadratic difference between the last active discrete frequency of VM ( i ) for the current job and the first active discrete frequency of VM ( i ) in the next incoming job. Finally, the communication cost ε net ( i ) can be expressed as: ε  n  e  t  (  i  )  =  P  n  e  t  (  i  )  ∑  j  =  1  Q  F  j  (  i  )  t  j  (  i  )  R  (  i  )  (10) where P net ( i ) is the power consumed by the i th end-to-end connection, F j ( i ) is the j th processing rate of VM ( i ), R ( i ) is the communication rate of the i th end-to-end connection and t j ( i ) is the computing time of VM ( i ) working at F j ( i ). Also, P net ( i ) is defined as: P  n  e  t  (  i  )  =  ζ  i  2  R  i  /  W  i  -  1  +  P  i  d  l  e  (  i  )  (11) with ζ  i  =  N  0  (  i  )  W  i  g  i , i = 1, …, M , where N 0 ( i ), W i and g i are noise spectral power density, transmission bandwidth and (nonnegative) gain of the i th link, respectively, and P idle ( i ) is the power consumed by the i th end-to-end connection in the idle mode. Accordingly, the power model in the simulation offering the energy-related values also takes into account the frequency reconfiguration and the communication costs in the final results beyond the computational cost. Hence, the total consumed energy ε tot in the simulator is calculated as: ε  t  o  t  =  ∑  i  =  1  M  ε  C  P  U  (  i  )  +  ∑  i  =  1  M  ε  R  e  c  o  n  f  (  i  )  +  ∑  i  =  1  M  ε  n  e  t  (  i  )  (12)  The default values of the power model and DVFS-based scheduler for the simulation are presented in Table 2 :   10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.t002  Table 2   Values of the power model and DVFS-based scheduler main parameters for the simulations.

Figs 10 , 11 and 12 present makespan results for the different governors, i.e., Performance (Perf), PowerSave (PowSv), OnDemand (OnDem) and Conservative (Cons) and the different scheduling strategies, i.e., static (ST-SCH) and the recent DVFS-based computing-plus-communication strategy (CAC-SHC) presented above [ 10 – 12 ], in the data center for the twelve different workloads, i.e., Montage workflows (25, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs), Inspiral workflows (30, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs) and Sipht workflows (30, 60, 100 and 1000 jobs) are presented.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g010  Fig 10   Time (makespan) summary for the different DVFS governors (Perf, PowSv, OnDem and Cons) and the different scheduling strategies (ST-SCH and CAC-SCH) with Montage traces (25, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs).      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g011  Fig 11   Time (makespan) summary for the different DVFS governors (Perf, PowSv, OnDem and Cons) and the different scheduling strategies (ST-SCH and CAC-SCH) with Inspiral traces (30, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs).      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g012  Fig 12   Time (makespan) summary for the different DVFS governors (Perf, PowSv, OnDem and Cons) and the different scheduling strategies (ST-SCH and CAC-SCH) with Sipht traces (30, 60, 100 and 1000 jobs).     As expected, it can be observed that, generally, the processing time of the workflows is incremented as the workflow considers a greater amount of jobs with independence of the type of workflow, i.e., Montage, Inspiral and Sipht, type of governor, i.e., Perf, PowSv, OnDem and Cons, and type of scheduling strategy, i.e., ST-SCH or CAC-SHC. However, since the jobs in the workflows are heterogeneous and present different types of dependencies in each case and their processing depend on the considered scheduling strategy, there are workflows with a shorter number of jobs whose processing is larger than other workflows composed of a greater number of jobs. This is the case of the processing of the Sipht workflow involving 60 jobs, whose processing time is larger than that of the Sipht workflow with 100 jobs for the CAC-SCH strategies, as observed in Fig 12 . Furthermore, it is shown that makespan results for governors can be categorized into two different types depending on the kind of scheduling strategy in the data center. Specifically, it can be observed that the overall processing time when DVFS governors are the only strategies for energy-optimization in the data center (i.e., the only energy saving mechanisms are the DVFS governors and a static scheduling strategy or ST-SCH scheduling type is considered) is significantly longer than that of provided by the data center when not only the DVFS governors are the energy saving strategies but the workload is scheduled considering a DVFS-based strategy (i.e., an inter-host energy overlapped strategy is added or CAC-SCH scheduling strategy). Also, it is shown, that the dynamic OnDemand governor and the static Performance governor process all workflows in a similar time, which is shorter than that offered by the PowerSave and Conservative governors for every type and number of jobs of the workflows and scheduling strategy. On the one hand, OnDemand governor scales up or down frequency of its associated processing element accordingly to the utilization level. Hence, in conditions of high workload (i.e., when the predefined utilization threshold of the governor is exceeded) this governor scales up the frequency of the processing element in a way that its processing capabilities are increased to execute workload as fast as possible, what is translated in more efficient results in terms of time. On the other hand, Performance governor keeps the frequency of the processing element in the higher value during its whole simulation and thus, the processing element offers the highest processing capabilities though all the workload execution and it is able to offer efficient results in terms of makespan. However, in the case of PowerSave, the governor keeps the frequency of the processing elements in its lowest value, i.e., lowest processing capabilities, what can delay the execution of workload depending on the amount of jobs to be processed. Also, in the case of Conservative governor, the strong gradual adaptation to changing workload conditions can also delay the execution. In this way, it can be appreciated that the time difference between the data center using PowerSave and Conservative governors and the data center using the rest of governors generally grows with the number of jobs involved in the workflow and the greatest difference is found for Montage, Sipht and Inspiral workflows with 1000 jobs (please note the use of a logarithm scale). These results are consistent both considering the static and computing-plus-communication DVFS-based scheduling strategies, although shorter makespan are offered with a dynamic scheduler. Hence, it can be appreciated that OnDemand and Performance governors offer the shortest execution time and that using a DVFS-based scheduling strategy significantly improve these results.  Also, Figs 13 , 14 and 15 show the overall power needed for the data center to process the different workflows, implemented governors and scheduling strategies.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g013  Fig 13   Overall power summary for the different DVFS governors (Perf, PowSv, OnDem and Cons) and the different scheduling strategies (ST-SCH and CAC-SCH) with Montage traces (25, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs).      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g014  Fig 14   Overall power summary for the different DVFS governors (Perf, PowSv, OnDem and Cons) and the different scheduling strategies (ST-SCH and CAC-SCH) with Inspiral traces (30, 50, 100 and 1000 jobs).      10.1371/journal.pone.0169803.g015  Fig 15   Overall power summary for the different DVFS governors (Perf, PowSv, OnDem and Cons) and the different scheduling strategies (ST-SCH and CAC-SCH) with Sipht traces (30, 60, 100 and 1000 jobs).     As in the case of makespan, the overall power grows as the number of jobs of the workload to be processed increases for all types of governors and scheduling strategies for most workflows (with the exception of Sipht with 60 jobs workload processed with CAC-SCH, Fig 15 ). This represents an expected result since the processing of a greater amount of jobs generally represents a greater power consumption. However, again, since there does not exist homogeneity in the characteristics and dependencies of jobs in the workflows and the way in which they are scheduled, the processing of a higher number of jobs does not necessarily involve a higher power consumption. Additionally, it can be observed that in the case of OnDemand and Performance governors, the overall required power is similar and lower than in the case of PowerSave and Conservative governors. Once again this is a logical result given that OnDemand governor performs a fast adaptation of its power consumption to the current utilization of the processing elements. Hence, OnDemand governor changes its performance accordingly to the current workload conditions, in contrast to PowerSave governor, which keeps its power consumption fixed during the whole execution to the lowest level without considering the utilization rate of the processing elements or Conservative governor, which also performs an adaptation to workload conditions but much more gradually, and so, slow. Also, as shown, Performance governor presents similar results to OnDemand governor in terms of power consumption through the consideration of the highest frequency level during the whole execution, which in the case of high utilization rates results significantly effective. Moreover, as it can be observed, the overall power consumption is lower when the considered scheduling strategy is the computing-plus-communication DVFS-based scheduling strategy, CAC-SCH, since it makes a distribution of workload based on the minimization of power consumption among the different virtual machines.  Also, the average power for the different governors, workloads and scheduling strategies can be considered. The average power in every case is calculated dividing the overall power consumption by the corresponding makespan, and so, it offers a normalized power result. In this case, as expected, a constant value is obtained: 17.6606 W for PowerSave, 19.1460 W for OnDemand, 17.6605 W for Conservative and 19.5781 W for Performance. It is appreciated that the governors offering the lower average power are PowerSave and Conservative. This could be expected, since PowerSave is designed to consume the minimum power during the whole performance of the processing element although this represents, as shown in Figs 10 , 11 and 12 , larger processing times. Also, in the case of Conservative governor, the slow adaptation capability of this dynamic governor increases the processing time as discussed for makespan, and thus, a low average power consumption can be expected. Analogously, Performance governor offers the highest average power consumption as it fixes power consumption of the processing elements to its maximum during the whole execution. Hence, these results show that the more efficient governor is OnDemand in terms of average power.  Finally, the performance of the different governors must be studied from the energy saving point of view, which results of the multiplication of the consumed energy and the makespan of the processing.

First, it is shown that the energy saving is more significant for those cases in which the communication-plus-communication scheduling DVFS-based strategy in used in the data center (i.e., CAC-SCH). This is an expected result since the performance of the CAC-SCH is based on the minimization of the overall energy consumption on a per-job basis and, as it can be observed, the results are validated with the different types of workload and number of jobs. Additionally, both in the case of static and DVFS-based scheduler, OnDemand governor generally presents the best results, followed by Performance governor. Again, as in the power discussion, similar results are presented for PowerSave and Conservative governors. Also, it is important to note that the difference in energy among the governors significantly increases with the number of jobs in most cases.  Finally, it must be mentioned that the conducted experiments in this work test the simulator performance considering both intra-host strategies, DVFS, and a DVFS-based inter-host strategy, the computing-plus-communication DVFS-based scheduling of the MMGreen framework (i.e., CAC-SCH) [ 10 – 12 ]. However, the consideration of other inter-host strategies for the Cloud management in the resource allocation area can be relevant for further progress in the development of energy-aware strategies in Cloud Computing and important and recent allocations models such as CSAM-IISG [ 33 ] could be integrated in the simulator. Furthermore, this simulator could be extended to offer capabilities in Mobile-Edge Computing where energy saving is also a critical problem and many real-world applications are being developed currently [ 12 , 34 ].     Conclusions  In this work, a new open source simulator for Cloud Computing energy-aware optimization and analysis for real workflows processing has been presented. The proposal extends the sophisticated WorkflowSim simulator to incorporate a power model allowing the estimation of power consumption in data centers considering the computing, frequency reconfiguration and network costs, and the leading intra-host managing strategy DVFS for dynamic adaptation of voltage and frequency to workload. Five types of DVFS governors are implemented and their performance is evaluated in diverse complex scenarios based on NASA´s Montage, Sipht and Inspiral projects in terms of CPU utilization, frequency scaling, power, energy and time saving. Moreover, the performance of the diverse governors are tested considering a recent DVFS-based scheduling strategy. It can be observed that the OnDemand dynamic governor offers greater energy saving and that this performance is significantly improved when a DVFS-based scheduling strategy is used. Hence, it is shown that the intra-host energy saving strategy of DVFS can be combined with inter-host DVFS-based scheduling strategies to increase energy saving in Cloud Computing. It is intended that WorkflowSim-DVFS platform could be used to develop further inter-host and intra-host energy saving information technology management strategies such as local and meta-scheduling scheduling of jobs and virtual machines considering DVFS on host strategy as backend support, as in updated data centers nowadays. Hence, this work provides an expected tool for future research in the field of Green Cloud Computing where the allocation of jobs with complex dependencies must be considered.

Auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) transmit acoustic information from the sensory hair cells to the cochlear nuclei. In experimental and clinical audiology, probing the whole ANF population remains a difficult task, as the ANFs differ greatly in their threshold and onset response to sound. Thus, low spontaneous rate (SR) fibers, which have rather higher thresholds, delay and larger jitter in their first spike latency are not detectable in the far-field compound action potential of the auditory nerve. Here, we developed a new protocol of acoustic stimulation together with electrophysiological signal processing to track the steady state activity of ANFs. Mass potentials at the round window were recorded in response to repetitive 300-ms bursts of 1/3 octave band noise centered on a frequency probe. Analysis was assessed during the last 200-ms of the response to capture the steady-state response of ANFs. To eliminate the microphonic component reflecting the sensory cells activity, repetitive pairs of sounds of opposite polarities were used. The spectral analysis was calculated on the average of two consecutive responses, and the neural gain was calculated by dividing point-by-point the spectrum to sound over unstimulated condition. In response to low-sound-level stimulation, neural gain predominated in the low-frequency cochlear regions, while a second component of responses centered on higher cochlear frequency regions appeared beyond 30 dB SPL. At 60 dB SPL, neural gain showed a bimodal shape, with a notch near 5.6 kHz. In addition to correlate with the functional mapping of ANFs along the tonotopic axis, the deletion of low-SR fibers leads to a reduction in the high-frequency response, where the low-SR fibers are preferentially located. Thus, mass potentials at the round window may provide a useful tool to probe the SR-based distribution of ANFs in humans and in other species in which direct single-unit recordings are difficult to achieve or not feasible.

Data Availability  All relevant data are within the paper.    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0169890.g006   Introduction  Within the cochlea, the mechano-transduction is achieved by sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) that convert acoustic stimulus into trains of action potentials along afferent auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). The ANFs show a great diversity in term of threshold, characteristic frequency (CF), and spontaneous rate (SR) of discharge, to encode sounds over a large intensity and frequency range [ 1 , 2 ]. For a given fiber, the SR is negatively correlated with threshold [ 1 ], making the high-SR fibers more sensitive to lower sound pressure levels whereas low-SR fibers are rather recruited at higher sound pressure levels.  The earliest single-unit studies of ANFs reported firing synchronization to the fine structure of tones, in the sense that discharges occur at a preferential timing of the cyclical waveform [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. For example, ANFs have the striking capability to “phase-lock” to low-frequency tones up to several kHz [ 8 ]. Above this frequency limit of neural phase-locking, inner hair cell (IHC) membrane potential cannot follow the sound stimulation waveform [ 9 ] and frequency coding relies on the place where each frequency produces vibrations along the basilar membrane (i.e., cochlear tonotopy). Phase-locking also occurs to stimulus envelope ([ 10 ] for a review). Both forms of phase-locking are readily apparent in the peri-stimulus time histogram to the amplitude modulated stimulus [ 11 , 12 , 13 ]. The range of modulation frequencies encoded by a single ANF is well characterized by a low-pass modulation transfer function with a 3-dB cut-off frequency, which increases with CF of the fibers [ 11 ].  The sound-evoked compound action potential (CAP) and its corresponding wave I of the auditory brainstem responses (ABR), which reflect the synchronous activity of ANFs at the stimulus onset, are commonly used to probe deafness in both experimental and clinical settings. However, based on paired recordings of single units and sound-evoked CAP, we reported previously that the delay of the first-spike latency and its large jitter make low-SR fibers unlikely to contribute to triggered CAP [ 14 ]. Thus, CAP and ABR wave 1 are not satisfactory measures for tracking all the ANF pools. Alternative detection tools are thus particularly important as i) low-SR fibers insure the coding of a large dynamic range of sound pressure levels [ 2 ], ii) low-SR fibers are finely phase-locked to the stimulus waveform envelope [ 11 , 12 , 13 ], which is essential for speech intelligibility, and iii) low-SR fibers are of a primary importance for signal detection in noisy environments [ 2 , 15 ].  Here, we develop a new protocol of acoustic stimulation and electrophysiolocal signal processing to detect the activity of ANFs, including the low-SR fiber pool. To do this, we analyzed mass potentials from an electrode placed on the round-window niche [ 16 , 17 ]. In absence of sound stimulation, this activity is known to reflect the asynchronous activity of the ANFs assembly [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] which is dominated by the high-SR fiber pool. The hallmark of this electrical neural noise corresponds to a spectral component that is best described by a power spectrum density (PSD) with a predominant peak near 900 Hz [ 18 ]. In response to sound stimulation, the mass potential contains both a neural component coming from ANFs, and a microphonic component originating from transduction currents in hair cells [ 21 ]. To eliminate the microphonic component, we used repetitive pairs of sounds of opposite polarities, and the neural gain was calculated by dividing point-by-point the spectrum to sound over unstimulated condition. Here, we showed that i) the amplitude of the neural gain correlates with the functional mapping of ANFs along the tonotopic axis [ 2 , 14 , 22 , 23 , 24 ], and ii) the deletion of low-SR fibers leads to a reduction in the high-frequency response (where the low-SR fibers are preferentially located), while the amplitude of CAP of the auditory nerve does not change.    Materials and Methods   1. Ethics statement  Female Mongolian gerbils (50–61 g, 8 to 12 weeks of age) were obtained from Janvier Labs (Saint-Isle, France). Animals were housed in facilities accredited by the French “Ministère de l’Agriculture et de la Forêt” (Agreement C-34-172-36; December 19, 2014). Animals facilities were maintained at 24°C, 60–80% relative humidity, on a 12 h light–dark cycle and the animals were allowed free access to food and water. Experiments were carried out in accordance with the animal welfare guidelines 2010/63/EC of the European Communities Council Directive regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures. Animals were housed in facilities accredited by the French “Ministère de l’Agriculture et de la Forêt” (Agreement C-34-172-36), and the experimental protocol was approved (Authorization CEEA-LR-12111) by the Animal Ethics Committee of Languedoc-Roussillon (CEEA-LR36; France). At the end of functional examination, gerbils were killed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia (Pentobarbital 50 mg/kg). A total number of 30 animals were used, of which 23 animals provided useful data as follows: 9 were infused with artificial perilymph into the round window niche during 30 minutes (among of them 5 were used for immunocytochemistry); 10 was infused with artificial periphymph containing 33 μM ouabain (among of them 5 were used for immunocytochemistry), 4 infused with artificial periphymph containing 10 μM TTX. All efforts were made to minimize the number and suffering of the animals used.    2. Drug preparation  Artificial perilymph solution consisted of the following (in mM): 137 NaCl; 5 KCl; 2 CaCl2; 1 MgCl2; 1 NaHCO3; 11 glucose; pH 7.4; osmolarity: 304 ± 4.3 mOsm/kg. Before each experiment, ouabain (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and tetrodotoxin (TTX, Latoxan, Portes les Valence, France) were prepared in artificial perilymph to a final concentration of 33 μM and 10 μM, respectively.    3. Surgery and round window infusion technique  Electrophysiological recordings were performed in anesthetized gerbils via a plug fixed on the skull and linked to the round window electrode. Gerbils were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 3 mg/kg Xylazine (Rompun®2%) and 40 mg/kg tiletamine/zolazepam (Zoletil®50). Electrocardiogram (EKG) and withdrawal reflex (lack of response to toe pinch) were used to insure a deep anesthesia and evaluate the physiological status of the animals. Supplemental doses of Xylazine and tiletamine/zolazepam were administered as needed.  The left cochlea was exposed through a dorsal approach. Once the bulla had been opened, the recording electrode was placed on the bony edge of the round window membrane, leaving enough space in the round window niche for the infusion glass pipette. The infusion glass pipette was filled with artificial perilymph alone or containing ouabain and was introduced into the round window niche (leaving the round window intact) using a micromanipulator (Warner Instruments). The infusion pipette was connected to a syringe pump (Warner Instruments), which pushed out the solution at a rate of 150 μl/h. After 30-min infusion, the solutions were wicked away from the round window niche, and the bulla (including the recording electrode) was closed with dental cement. The round window and the reference electrode placed in the neck were soldered to a plug fixed on the skull. The surgical site was then cleared and the skin wiped with a topical antiseptic (Betadine). In the days immediately after surgery, animals were weighed for evidence of weight stability/gain, and observed for evidence of good mobility in their cage.    4. Electrophysiological recordings  Six days after artificial perilymph (control) or 33 μM ouabain perfusion, electrophysiological recordings were performed under anaesthesia (3 mg/kg Xylazine and 40 mg/kg tiletamine/zolazepam) in a Faraday shielded anechoic sound proof cage. The animal’s rectal temperature was measured with a thermistor probe and maintained at 38°C ± 1°C using a heating blanket. The acoustical stimuli were delivered under calibrated conditions using a custom acoustic assembly set-up including a signal generator (PXI-4461 controlled by LabVIEW, National Instrument Company), an audio amplifier (Tucker Davis, SA1) and a magnetic speaker (Tucker Davis, MF1).  The compound action potential (CAP) was recorded from the round window electrode in response to 10-ms tone bursts at 2 to 32 kHz (1-ms rise/fall, 11 bursts/s, alternating polarity). Amplification of the cochlear signal (×20,000) was achieved by a Grass P511 differential amplifier with a 100 Hz to 3.5 kHz bandpass. CAP amplitude was measured between N 1 and P 1 , the threshold being defined as the dB SPL needed to elicit a measurable response (> 2 μV).  The power spectral density (PSD) of electrical neural noise was recorded in the absence (unstimulated) or in response to sound stimulation (stimulated) using the same electrode-amplifier assembly dedicated for CAP measurement but with a 1 Hz to 30 kHz bandpass. Acoustic stimuli consisted of bursts of one third–octave band noise centered at a probe frequency varying from 1 to 32 kHz in 1/3 octave steps (2.5-ms rise and fall, 300-ms on/300-ms off, 100 presentations per level). A single PSD estimate using Welch’s method ([ 25 ]; pwelch function using Matlab language, 2048 samples per segment, 50% overlapped, rectangular window, sampling rate 50,000 samples/sec) was calculated on each trial during the last 200-ms of the sound stimulation, and the mean PSD was then calculated by averaging all the PSDs. With this analysis time window, we excluded on-set [ 26 , 27 ] and off-set [ 28 ] adaptation responses of fibers. A detailed description of the method is provided in the Result part and Fig 1 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0169890.g001  Fig 1   Extraction of a neural index from the round-window response.  (A, B) Round-window responses (bottom, s ) were evoked by repetitive 300-ms bursts of third-octave band noise (top, e ) centered at a probe frequency (50 dB SPL and 4 kHz in this example). To reduce the cochlear microphonic: i ) two consecutive stimuli (that form a pair) were presented in opposite polarity and ii ) all the pairs ( n = 50) differed from each other (by changing the seed of the pseudorandom stream). ( C ) Calculation of halved sum (red) and halved difference (green) within each pair of response using black and blue traces shown in B . ( D-O) Spectral analysis of round-window response before ( D-I ) and after 10 μM TTX application ( J-O ) into the round window niche. The grey trace is the power spectral density of the signal recorded at the round window in the absence of sound stimulation (unstimulated activity). Black and blue traces ( D, E ) are calculated from responses with even-numbered (black, first element of each pair) or odd-numbered rank (blue, second element of each pair). Note the mixture of a neural component centered around 900 Hz and the microphonic centered at 4 kHz. To segregate neural and microphonic components, the spectral analysis was calculated after the half summation (red, F ) or the half difference (green, G ) of traces within each pair of response (see equations in inset). The neural and microphonic sound-evoked activities (red and green traces in H and I ) were derived from the traces shown in F and G respectively (ratio between colored and grey traces). Note the complete disappearance of neural activity after TTX application, leaving the cochlear microphonic unaffected ( J-O ). The area under the red curve in panel H was used as an index of neural sound-evoked activity (34.5 dB×kHz in this example).       5. Contribution of unitary action potential at the round window  The unitary contribution (unit action potential) to the response at the round window was computed according Kiang and co-workers [ 29 ]. In absence of sound stimulation, each spontaneous action potential fired by one fiber in the auditory nerve is used as a trigger pulse to average its corresponding unitary action potential recorded at the round window[ 30 ]. The method to record single auditory nerve fibers in gerbils has been described elsewhere [ 2 , 14 ].  The contribution of the unit action potential to the electrical neural noise in response to amplitude modulated bandlimited noise was simulated by convolving the waveform of unitary contribution with a stereotyped modulation transfer function (lowpass Butterworth filter, 8th order) according to [ 11 ]. The 3-dB cut-off frequency of low-pass filters was automatically adjusted with a derivative-free method ( fminsearch function using Matlab language) to match experimental data at 60 dB SPL.    6. Number of ribbon-synapses per inner hair cell along the tonotopic axis  The immunohistochemistry method to assess the number of synapses per inner hair cell (IHC) has been extensively described [ 14 ]. Briefly, the presynaptic IHC ribbons were identified using a mouse anti-CtBP2 antibody (1:500; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Glutamate receptors were labelled with a mouse antibody raised against the C-terminus of the GluA2 subunit, IgG2a (1:200, Millipore, Billerica, MA). A 3D, custom algorithm was used to detect the juxtaposition of pre- and post-synaptic structures in stacked confocal images.    7. Data analysis  Means were expressed ± S.E.M. The significance of the group differences was assessed with a two-ways ANOVA; given significance of the group differences ( p < 0.05), a Tukey's post hoc tests were subsequently used for pairwise comparisons; * p <0.05, and ** p <0.01. Data analysis was performed using Matlab (The Mathworks Company) and its Statistics, Signal, and Image toolboxes.     Results  In the absence of sound stimulation, the PSD of electrical round-window noise exhibited maximal energy at the lowest frequencies, reaching a minimum at ~ 400 Hz (422 Hz ± 19, mean ± SEM, n = 30) and a broad peak centered on ~ 900 Hz (915 Hz ± 16, mean ± SEM, n = 30, Fig 1 ). To probe the efficiency of PSD amplitude for the detection of the subtle loss of low-SR fibers, we compared sound-evoked responses recorded 6 days after a 30 min infusion of 33 μM ouabain into the round window niche ( n = 9) to those of controls obtained with control artificial perilymph ( n = 10).   1. Sound-driven neural activity at the round window  Mass potentials at the round window were recorded in response to 300-ms bursts of 1/3 octave band noise centered on a frequency probe ( Fig 1A ). The PSD of mass potentials was assessed during the last 200-ms of the response, to capture the steady-state response of ANFs. To extract the neural activity and cochlear microphonic, reflecting the auditory-nerve and sensory hair-cell activity, we used repetitive pairs of noise bursts of opposite polarities, all the pairs differing from each other in their temporal structure ( Fig 1A and 1B ). When estimated over the first or second element of the 50 pairs (black and blue traces in Fig 1A and 1B , respectively), the PSD is characterized by a mixture of both neural and microphonic components ( Fig 1D and 1E ). In each pair of bursts having opposite polarities, summed temporal response drastically reduces the microphonic potential, isolating the neural component (red traces in Fig 1C and its PSD in Fig 1F ). In contrast, the difference between the temporal traces within each pair resolves the microphonic component only, i . e ., the amplitude of the 900-Hz peak was comparable to the unstimulated activity (see green traces in Fig 1C and its PSD in Fig 1G ).  The gain of activity (neural and microphonic) evoked by sound stimulation was measured by dividing point-by-point the PSD measured in response to sound by the PSD in unstimulated condition ( Fig 1H and 1I ). When this ratio is closed to 1 ( i . e . 0 dB in gain), there is no gain of activity evoked by sound. Inversely, a ratio above 1 indicates a significant gain of activity that can be expressed in dB (see double axes in Fig 1H and 1I ). Consistent with its neural origin, the acute 30-min round window infusion of 10 μM TTX ( n = 4) abolished the neural response, leaving the cochlear microphonic unaffected ( Fig 1J–1O ). We sometimes observed a 200 Hz peak after TTX infusion, i . e ., when the neural activity was inhibited. Although this component has been attributed to the activity of the dorsal cochlear nucleus [ 20 ] or to be a manifestation of tinnitus [ 31 ], the lack of effect in response to increasing sound stimulation of this 200 Hz component suggests an origin in extra-auditory structures ( Fig 1J–1M ).  We then quantify the neural gain across frequency and intensity. When the cochlea was stimulated at 16 kHz and 8 kHz, neural gain increased monotonically according to sound levels, with a predominant peak in the PSD curve around 900 Hz ( Fig 2A and 2B and Fig 2F and 2G ). For sound stimulation from 4 to 1 kHz, the maximum gain peak shifts to the left, i . e . toward the low-frequency spectral component from 600 to 200 Hz, respectively (582 ± 43 Hz at 4 kHz, 338 ± 45 Hz at 2 kHz, and 191 ± 3 Hz at 1 kHz, Fig 2C–2E and Fig 2H–2J ). This frequency shift can be explained by occurrence of low frequency fluctuations in spike train in response to low-frequency envelope modulations in the stimulus, consistently with a low-pass modulation transfer function [ 10 , 11 , 32 ]. In theory, convolution of the “unitary action potential” of the auditory nerve recorded from the round window [ 29 , 30 , 33 ] with low-pass modulation transfer function should recapitulate the frequency shift we observed in the neural gain. To address the hypothesis, we first simulate the experimental waveform of unitary action potential recorded in 5 normal-hearing gerbils ( n = 59 fibers, >10,000 averaging per fiber, CF ranging from 0.89 to 48 kHz, SR ranging from 3 to 130 spikes/sec, see inset in Fig 3A–3C ). We then reproduce the shift of the peak toward low-frequency range of the spectrum ( Fig 3D ) by applying low pass filter transfer function ( Fig 3E ) with a 3-dB cut-off frequency positively correlated with CF (210 Hz at CF = 1 kHz, 400 Hz at CF = 2 kHz, 720 Hz at CF = 4 kHz, 1180 Hz at CF = 8 kHz, 1660 Hz at CF = 16 kHz, 1940 Hz at CF = 32 kHz, see Fig 3D inset).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169890.g002  Fig 2   Neural subcomponents in round window responses.

A. Protocol used to record unit contribution at the round window (from [ 29 , 30 , 33 ]). Spontaneous action potentials (black trace) recorded with an electrode in the auditory nerve were used as trigger pulses to average the corresponding action potentials recorded with a gross electrode at the round window (blue trace). After more than 10,000 averages, a biphasic waveform of 0.3 μV amplitude, 1 ms second duration, was obtained. Red fit: f(t) = A×((cos(2πf 1 t)+1)×sin(2πf 2 t) with A = 0.31 ± 0.04 μV, f 1 = 997 ± 20 Hz, f 2 = 920 ± 33 Hz, R 2 = 0.95 ± 0.007, 59 fibers, >10,000 averaging per fiber. B .

Note the spectrum shift for a probe frequency below 10 kHz.

Low-pass modulation transfer functions obtained from C and D (8 th order Butterworth filters, 0 dB in band pass and cut-off frequency at 3-dB) for fibers with CF ranging from 1 to 32 kHz in 1 octave steps. Note that cut-off frequency is positively correlated with the CF of the fibers.     In addition, an harmonic at twice the probe frequency appeared in neural gain in the summed response to 1 and 2 kHz third-octave band noise ( Fig 2D, 2E, 2I and 2J ). Due to the non-linear nature of the ANF response [ 16 , 17 , 34 , 35 ], the low-frequency neurophonic response consists of multiple harmonics (dominated by a strong 1 st and 2 nd harmonic). These harmonics were divided over the sum and difference responses (see Fig 1 and Fig 2 ). For the fine-structure-neurophonic, the summed response contains all even harmonics and is dominated by the second harmonic, whereas difference response contains all odd harmonics, dominated by the first. To control that the second harmonic measured in the summed response originates from neurophonic, and does not correspond to a microphonic component, we applied TTX into the round window niche and retested the animal using the same protocol ( Fig 2K–2T ). Indeed, the neurophonic responses including the second harmonic disappeared after TTX application.    2. Neural gain index reflect the SR distribution of ANFs  The area under the curve of the neural gain (in dB) was then measured as a neural gain index ( Fig 1H ) and plotted as a function of the probe frequency ( Fig 4A ). The iso-level frequency response of the neural gain showed different spectral patterns according to the level of sound stimulation. At low stimulation levels (below 20 dB SPL), the neural gain index predominated in the 4 kHz frequency range. Up to 30 dB SPL, a second response component centered on the 12 kHz appeared. At 60 dB SPL, the iso-level function displayed a two-peak shape with a low frequency peak at 2.5 kHz and a high frequency peak at 12.5 kHz ( Fig 4A ). Although the number of synapses per IHC reached about 20–25 synapses per IHC (see [ 36 ]) in the 1–2 kHz region of the cochlea, a drastic reduction in the neural gain index was seen for probe frequencies below 2 kHz. This neural cancelation may be due to the phase-locking behavior of the ANFs to fine structure presented in alternating phase ( Fig 2E and 2J , [ 16 , 34 , 35 ]). At these low-frequencies of stimulation, the fine-structure of the waveform follows the stimulus polarities, eliciting phase-locked firing of the ANFs in a 180° phase shift (i.e., 1/2 cycle shift). In far field recordings, the summation of the response for 2 stimuli of opposite polarities will cancel the phase-locked neural activity, and thus account for the poor sensitivity of the 900-Hz peak to sound stimulation ( Fig 2E and 2J ). To further test that the bimodal shape of the sound-driven neural responses reflected the SR-based distribution in the auditory nerve of gerbil, we therefore only consider neural gain index in response to acoustic stimulation centered on frequencies above 2 kHz for further analysis.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169890.g004  Fig 4   Probing the auditory nerve using round-window response in control and ouabain-poisoned cochleae.

The frequency probe varied from 1 to 32 kHz in 1/3 octave steps and sound level from 10 (red curve) to 60 dB SPL (green curve) in 10 dB steps. Note that below 2 kHz (light-coloured area), the neural index amplitude decreases because of the phase locked response of fibers and their cancelation by opposite polarities.

X and Y error bars display the mean ± SEM of data shown in x and y axis, respectively; * p <0.05, two-way ANOVA test followed by post hoc Tukey’s test.     Next, we probe the sensitivity of the neural index to the loss of low-SR fibers by infusing ouabain into the round window niche [ 14 ]. Six days after a 33 μM ouabain infusion, the neural index was significantly decreased in the 12 kHz frequency range, leaving the lower frequency region below 5.6 kHz, unaffected ( Fig 4B–4F ). We then compared the neural gain index after ouabain infusion with artificial perilymph at the same frequency and sound-stimulation level ( Fig 4G and 4H ). Below 5.6 kHz, the neural gain index showed a linear relationship between the poisoned and the control cochleae, indicating that ouabain has no effect on the neural activity in the low-frequency range ( Fig 4G ). In contrast, above 5.6 kHz (the region populated by low-SR spontaneous rate fibers), a reduction in the neural gain was observed especially for the largest corresponding to higher levels of sound stimulation ( Fig 4H ). Worthy of note is the lack of significant change in the CAP amplitude-intensity functions at all narrow-band frequency ranges tested ( Fig 5A–5D ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169890.g005  Fig 5   Compound action potential of the auditory nerve in control and ouabain-poisoned cochleae.

Quantification of ribbon-synapses per inner hair cell  The high-frequency reduction of neural gain index in ouabain-treated gerbils was then demonstrated to correspond to a reduction in the number of synapses beyond the 5.6 kHz cochlear region. Using immunohistochemistry, the ribbon-anchored synapse number was approximated along the tonotopic axis by the juxtaposition of the IHCs presynaptic ribbon organelle and the postsynaptic density ( Fig 6A and 6B ). In artificial prerilymph control cochleae ( n = 5), the distribution of synapses per IHC was bimodal, with a prominent number of synapses in the 2 and the 16 kHz cochlear regions ( Fig 6C ), which is consistent with the bimodal shape of the iso-level neural gain at 60 dB SPL ( Fig 4A ). Six days after infusion of 33 μM ouabain into the round window niche ( n = 5), the distribution of synapses per IHC along the tonotopic axis displayed a single mode centered on 2 kHz ( Fig 6C and 6D ). Interestingly, the total number of synapses decreased by 11% in ouabain-poisoned cochleae ( Fig 6C inset), with the greatest reduction in the 16 and 32 kHz regions (-22% and -36%, respectively, Fig 6D ). This is consistent with the distribution of low-SR fibers in the base of the gerbil cochlea [ 2 , 14 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0169890.g006  Fig 6   Synapse counts in control and ouabain-poisoned cochleae.

Discussion  The present study demonstrated that monitoring the mass potentials recorded at the round window niche makes possible the detection of low-SR fibers while the monitoring of CAP amplitude fails. In contrast to other mammals, in which the SR-based distribution of ANFs along the tonotopic axis is relatively homogenous [ 37 ], the gerbil cochlea displays considerable variations with a prevalence of high-SR (SR > 18 spikes/s) below 3.5 kHz and a more balanced distribution of high-, medium- (0.5 < SR < 18 spikes/s) and low-SR (SR < 0.5 spike/s) fibers above 3.5 kHz [ 2 , 14 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. The iso-level frequency response of the neural index at 60 dB SPL displays a bimodal shape peaking at 2 kHz and 16 kHz, as a probe-stimulation level of 60 dB SPL suffices to activate all the ANFs independently of their SR [ 2 ] with a weak spread of excitation [ 38 ]. Consistently, when the level of stimulation decreases below the threshold of low-SR fibers (threshold of 30–40 dB SPL, [ 2 ]), the iso-level frequency response curve becomes unimodal with a peak at 2 kHz reflecting mainly the activation of high-SR fibers (threshold of 10–20 dB SPL, [ 2 ]). This hypothesis is confirmed after the ablation of low-SR fibers, in which the iso-level neural gain index remains unimodal even at 60 dB SPL. Taken together, the neural gain index at 2 and 16 kHz are the signatures of differing compositions of ANF pools at the base and the apex of the gerbil’s cochlea, i.e., the shape of the iso-level response of neural gain index represents the cumulative activation of ANFs according to their SR and threshold.   Different contributions in the summed response to alternating stimulus polarities  Mass potential recorded at the round window contains both a neural arising from ANFs, and a microphonic component originating from transduction currents of hair cells [ 21 ]. Using appropriate sound stimulation and signal processing protocols, we are able to eliminate the microphonic component generated by hair cells. This is of particular interest below 4 kHz, where cochlear microphonic would overlap with the “900 Hz-peak” and thus interfering with the measurement of the neural activity. Unfortunately, this procedure also reduces the spectral component in low-frequency region (< 2 kHz) where fibers are phase-locked with fine structure of the stimulus (1/3 octave band noise in this study). Indeed, neural responses arising from the phase-locked activity of ANFs, called neurophonic response can be subdivided in two components: the neurophonic related to the stimulus fine-structure and the neurophonic related to the stimulus envelope. In our study, both types of neurophonic contribute to the mass potential response recorded at the round window, since we used a small band of noise rather than a pure tone. At low frequency (below 4 kHz in gerbil, [ 39 ]), the neurophonic is related to the fine-structure, and at high frequency (above 4 kHz) it is only related to envelope (see [ 10 ] for a review). At low frequency, the second stimulation within each pair of stimuli occurs in opposite phase with the first and the ANFs respond in phase locking to fine structure, but with a shift of ½ cycle of stimulation. The summation of opposite phase responses leads to the reduction of the first harmonic neural activity, whereas the second harmonic at twice the frequency of the probe was maintained [ 16 , 17 , 34 , 35 ]. Consequently, for frequencies below 2 kHz, the gain of neural activity is tricked because of the phase locking to fine structure. Therefore, second harmonic [ 34 , 35 ] or forward masking procedures [ 16 , 17 ] would be more appropriated to probe low-CF fibers.    Contribution of the low-SR fibers to the mass potentials recorded at the round window  Whereas low-SR fibers are not detectable in the CAP of the auditory nerve, we report a reduction of the neural gain in the frequency range where the low-SR fibers are located, mostly in the basal turn [ 2 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. Our current hypothesis is because CAP only captures the first spike of the fibers responding in synchrony to the acoustic stimulation, while the neural gain measured herein relies on steady state response. In our experiments, neural activity was measured over the last hundreds of milliseconds of the acoustic stimulation. In contrast, the first spikes of ANFs firing in synchrony with the onset-stimulus yield the sound-evoked CAP. In gerbils, the degree of synchronization of ANFs (i.e. first spike latency jitter) is positively correlated with SR [ 14 ]. Consequently, the low-SR fibers do not contribute to the CAP, and their loss is thus not detected in the CAP. Accordingly, 33 μM ouabain led to a steady-state neural activity reduction in the high frequency region of the cochlea where the low-SR fibers are located, while the CAP did not change.     Conclusion  Altogether, our data support the idea that the use of electrophysiological methods based on first spike response is not suitable to track the loss of low-SR fibers. This result questions the use of CAP and the first positive wave (P1) of the auditory brainstem responses in experimental and clinical assessments, as both metrics only reflect the first spike of an assembly of fibers which fired in synchrony. Here, we propose that mass potentials at round-window, which do not rely on the onset response of fibers but rather the steady state discharge rate, constitute a more promising avenue to probe the SR-based distribution of ANFs in humans using transtympanic electrocochleography [ 40 ], and in other species in which direct single-unit recordings are difficult to achieve or are not feasible.

The grape yeast biota from several wine-producing areas, with distinct soil types and grapevine training systems, was assessed on five islands of Azores Archipelago, and differences in yeast communities composition associated with the geographic origin of the grapes were explored. Fifty-seven grape samples belonging to the Vitis vinifera grapevine cultivars Verdelho dos Açores ( Verdelho ), Arinto da Terceira ( Arinto ) and Terrantez do Pico ( Terrantez ) were collected in two consecutive years and 40 spontaneous fermentations were achieved. A total of 1710 yeast isolates were obtained from freshly crushed grapes and 1200 from final stage of fermentations. Twenty-eight species were identified, Hanseniaspura uvarum , Pichia terricola and Metschnikowia pulcherrima being the three most representative species isolated. Candida carpophila was encountered for the first time as an inhabitant of grape or wine-associated environments. In both sampling years, a higher proportion of H . uvarum in fresh grapes from Verdelho cultivar was observed, in comparison with Arinto cultivar. Qualitatively significant differences were found among yeast communities from several locations on five islands of the Archipelago, particularly in locations with distinctive agro-ecological compositions. Our results are in agreement with the statement that grape-associated microbial biogeography is non-randomly associated with interactions of climate, soil, cultivar, and vine training systems in vineyard ecosystems. Our observations strongly support a possible linkage between grape yeast and wine typicality, reinforcing the statement that different viticultural terroirs harbor distinctive yeast biota, in particular in vineyards with very distinctive environmental conditions.

Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , especially adapted, play the major role but the initial fermentation stages are usually carried out by non- Saccharomyces species [ 1 ]. The species Hanseniaspora uvarum (anamorph Kloeckera apiculata ) is widely reported as predominant in initial stages of spontaneous fermentations, together with Candida spp. and Pichia spp. [ 2 – 9 ]. It is well known that the yeasts species/strains present during must fermentation affect wine’s flavor and aroma [ 10 – 14 ], because they act differently on musts, yielding different metabolites in different amounts [ 15 – 19 ]. Yeast biodiversity in vineyards are mainly affected by the grapevine cultivar [ 20 – 22 ], viticultural and oenological practices [ 23 – 29 ], macro and microclimatic conditions [ 1 , 30 – 32 ] and the geographic location of the vineyard [ 20 , 33 – 35 ]. It has been generally thought that different regions and grapevine cultivars, under different farm management practices–different viticultural terroirs –may harbor distinctive yeast communities and populations. Preserving the terroir characteristic of each wine has been one of the main concerns of the winemaking industry [ 21 ]. This led to an increased focus on the selection of autochthonous yeast, that might be better adapted to the fermentation of a particular grape must and might contribute to the typical oenological characteristics of a particular region [ 36 – 41 ]. Despite the suggestion that grape heath status is the main factor affecting the microbial ecology of grapes. [ 42 ] the idea that microbiological resources might be influenced by terroir aspects has long been suggested by several authors [ 21 , 22 , 43 – 45 ], and was recently demonstrated by using advanced short-amplicon sequencing approach by Bokulich et al. [ 32 ]. Moreover, the evidence for regional dispersion of vineyard-associated yeasts was previously described for cultivable yeast communities in New Zealand vineyards [ 46 ].  On the islands of the Azores Archipelago unique viticultural environments occur in several locations, resulting from the interaction between very particular macro and microclimatic conditions, autochthonous grapevine cultivars and local viticultural practices. Two important wine-producing regions in Azores Archipelago are Lajidos (PLJ) in Pico Island (classified by UNESCO as world heritage ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1117 )) and Biscoitos (BCT), in Terceira Island, both corresponding to viticultural areas that are very distinct from the remaining locations in the archipelago.  Besides the vineyards installed in arable lands, grapevines were traditionally planted in poor soils (shallow or stony). Plants are placed in the irregularly distributed cracks of almost unmodified solidified lava flows ( lajido ) or in soils covered by thick layers of stones ( biscoito ). These particular types of soil ensure unique microclimates at the grape berry level, characterized by lower humidity and higher temperatures at maturation time. The grapevine training systems are mainly dependent on the soil type of the vineyard. Both in biscoito and in lajido , grapevines are not trellised, and the training system is unique for each plant depending on the area they have available. In the vineyards planted in arable soil, grapevines can be trellised or not.  The existence of different viticultural conditions in island environment, with well-defined borders, represents a suitable model to address the question of yeast biota / terroir association. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the yeast biota from the Azorean traditional grape cultivars growing in several wine-producing areas from the Archipelago, and search for differences in grape yeast communities associated with those agro-ecological zones.    Material and Methods   Sampling and yeast isolation  The sampling areas were selected based on the combination of three agro-ecological criteria: i) type of soil (arable soil— arable ; soil covered with stones— stony ; solidified lava flows— lava ); ii) grapevine cultivars ( Verdelho : Verdelho dos Açores; Arinto : Arinto da Terceira; Terrantez : Terrantez do Pico); and iii) the grapevine training system (trellised grapevines, non-trellised grapevines; lying grapevines) ( Fig 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169883.g001  Fig 1   Combinations of soil type and grapevine training system in the sampled vineyards.  A: not- trellised grapevine (NT) in soil covered with stones (SS); B: NT in solidified lava flows (SL); C: NT in arable soil (AS); D: trellised grapevines (TG) in AS.     Grape samples belonging to white Vitis vinifera cultivars Verdelho , Arinto and Terrantez were collected from 22 vineyards on 13 locations on five islands of the Azores Archipelago during the 2009 and 2010 harvests (30 and 27 grape samples, respectively) ( Fig 2 ), always with the permission of the land owners. Locations were chosen within the existing vineyards, being the number of locations per island independent of its area. Each sample consisted of approximately 2–3 kg of rot-free grape bunches that were collected aseptically into sterile plastic bags and immediately transported to the laboratory under refrigerated conditions. For each location grape bunches were harvested in four different sampling points, separated by an average distance of ca . 10 m, in order to obtain a high diversity inside each harvest location. The berries were manually crushed inside the sterile bags, and from each sample 500 mL of must were obtained and fermented, using 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with a rubber stopper that was perforated with a syringe needle to allow CO 2 release. Fermentations were performed at room temperature and progress was followed by daily weight loss determinations due to CO 2 production. Immediately after the preparation of the must, diluted aliquots (10 −1 to 10 −5 ) were spread on plates containing YPD medium (yeast extract, 1% w/v; peptone, 1% w/v; glucose 2% w/v and agar 2%, w/v) supplemented with biphenyl (40 mg L -1 ). After incubation (2 days, 30°C), 30 colonies were randomly collected from plates containing between 30 and 300 colonies, which corresponded to a dilution of 10 −2 . When the weight loss of the must was about 65–70 g, corresponding to a stage close to the end of fermentation, must aliquots were again withdrawn, diluted and spread onto agar plates containing YPD medium (without biphenyl supplementation). Thirty colonies were randomly collected from plates containing between 30 and 300 colonies. Yeast isolates were stored in glycerol (30%, v/v) at -80°C.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169883.g002  Fig 2    Sampling sites (A) and summary of the samples collected (B) in 2009 and 2010 in 22 vineyards from 13 wine-producing areas on five islands of the Azores Archipelago, from the grapevine cultivars Verdelho dos Açores (Ver), Arinto da Terceira (Ar) e Terrantez do Pico (Tr) planted in arable soil (AS), soil covered with stone (SS) or solidified lava flows (LF), and trained as trellised grapevines (TG), non-trellised grapevines (NT) or lying grapevines (LG).       Molecular identification of the yeast isolates  DNA extraction was performed according to Drumonde-Neves et al . [ 47 ]. Molecular identification of isolates from freshly crushed grapes was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) and DNA sequencing. The 5.8-S ITS region was amplified using the primers ITS1 ( 5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3' ) and ITS4 ( 5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3' ) [ 48 ]. PCR reaction was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 6 min; 35 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 20 s, annealing at 53°C for 20 s, extension at 72°C for 1 min; final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR amplification was carried out in a final volume of 10 μ L of a reaction mix containing 20–50 ng of yeast DNA, 0.5 U Taq polymerase (MBI Fermentas), 1x Taq buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, 50 mM KCl, 0.08% Nonidet P-40), 0.4 p mol of each primer, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotides and 1.5 mM MgCl 2 . After dilution (1:4), 10 μ L of the PCR products were digested with the restriction endonuclease Hinf I (Fermentas) according to the supplier’s instructions. PCR products and their restriction fragments were mixed and separated in a 2% (w/v) agarose gel containing GelRed TM , (1x TAE Buffer, 100 V, 75 min). Identical electrophoretic profiles of each sample were considered as conspecific and grouped, and one representative isolate per group was selected for sequencing of the 5.8-S ITS region. The amplicons were obtained as described above and sequenced by the Sanger method [ 49 , 50 ]. Sequence reactions were performed by use of the forward primer ITS1, and a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequence Ready Reaction Kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After the sequence reaction, excess dye terminators were removed by gel filtration. Sequences were analyzed with an automated DNA sequencer 3730XL (Applied Biosystems). Species identity was determined using the BLASTN program [ 51 ] and GenBank reference sequences, considering an identity threshold of at least 98%.  Regarding final stages of fermentation, all isolates were analyzed by interdelta sequence typing [ 52 , 53 ]. Isolates that showed no interdelta pattern were considered to belong to non- Saccharomyces species, and were identified using the method described above.    Statistical analysis  Differences in community composition between islands/regions were tested by analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) on squared root transformed species incidences, using the informatics program PAST [ 54 ]. An analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) test makes no assumption about the normality of data and this multivariate test is classically used in community ecology. The test reports the probability of observing differences in community composition between islands/locations by chance using permutations of a rank Bray–Curtis similarity matrix to create null distributions [ 55 ]. The observed rank abundance difference ( R ) between islands/locations is reported, and this value ranges from -1 to +1. R -values above or below zero indicate that communities differ or not, respectively, between islands/locations. Null distributions were generated, that recalculated R under a framework that assumed no difference between regions, by randomizing the labels associated with samples across the entire data set one million independent times.     Results   Yeast species occurring on freshly crushed grapes  A total of 22 vineyards were sampled, spanning the geographic range of the wine-producing regions of the Azores Archipelago, as listed in Fig 2 . Fifty-seven grape samples of the white grapevine cultivars Verdelho dos Açores, Arinto da Terceira and Terrantez do Pico were collected in 2009 and 2010, and 1710 yeast isolates were obtained from the freshly crushed grapes and analyzed by ITS-RFLP and by sequencing the 5.8-S ITS region. As summarized in Table 1 a total of 26 species were found in both years (14 in 2009 and 12 in 2010), corresponding to 19 different species since seven of them were found in both sampling years.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169883.t001  Table 1  Incidence of each yeast species (%) isolated from 57 grape samples collected on 5 islands of the Azores Archipelago (BCT: Biscoitos; GRC: Graciosa Island; PLJ: Lajidos; PRL: remaining locations in Pico; SJG: S.

In the second sampling year the incidence of this species was considerably higher in comparison to the previous year, ranging between 53.3% (grape samples from Arinto cultivar collected in Biscoitos) and 100% (grape samples from Verdelho collected in the remaining locations in Pico). Metschnikowia pulcherrima was the second most representative yeast species. However it occurred only in 2009 and with a considerably higher incidence on Lajidos (95.6% and 83.3%, Arinto and Verdelho grape cultivars, respectively) compared to Graciosa (3.3% and 5.8%, Arinto and Verdelho grape cultivars, respectively) and S. Jorge (3.3%, Arinto grape cultivar). Pichia terricola was the third most representative species, corresponding to 15% and 3% of the isolates obtained in 2009 and 2010, respectively. In the first sampling year this species was isolated from Arinto grapes in all islands, ranging between 2.2% and 80.0% of the isolates from Lajidos and Biscoitos, respectively. From the grape cultivar Verdelho , P . terricola was isolated in 2009 only in Biscoitos and Lajidos (33.3% and 1.7% of the isolates, respectively). In grape samples from the cultivar Terrantez , P . terricola was found only in “remaining locations in Pico” both in 2009 (23.3%) and 2010 (6.7%). In 2010 this species was also found in grape samples from Arinto collected in Biscoitos (2.2%), Lajidos (2.2%), “remaining locations in Pico” (0.8%) and S. Jorge (5.0%) and in samples from Verdelho collected in S. Miguel (1.7%), Graciosa (7.8%) and Lajidos (15%). Similar patterns of distribution among the different islands and sampling years were also observed for the yeast species with a lower global representation such as Starmerella bacillaris (former Candida zemplinina ) or Saccharomycopsis vini . To our knowledge, the species Candida carpophila was not previously found in grape or wine-associated environments, unlike the remaining species listed in Table 1 .  When analyzing the global yeast biota isolated from the grape samples of each of the cultivars ( Fig 3A ), we observed that the percentage of H . uvarum isolated from the Verdelho samples was higher compared to the samples from Arinto cultivar (26,9% and 15,4%, in 2009 and 2010, respectively). This same tendency was observed when the comparison of the yeast biota isolated from each of the two grape cultivars was performed according to the islands ( Fig 3B ) or sampling locations where the varieties Verdelho and Arinto occurred simultaneously ( Fig 3C ). This was not observed in the vineyard 12, where the percentage of H . uvarum isolates from Arinto grapes was of 83% while this species was not isolated from grapes of the Verdelho variety. However, in this vineyard, 100% of the isolates collected from Verdelho cultivar corresponded to Hanseniaspora opuntiae , representing a higher proportion of the Hanseniaspora genus on Verdelho cultivar in comparison to Arinto .   10.1371/journal.pone.0169883.g003  Fig 3    Yeast communities composition (in percentage) from freshly crushed grapes of the grapevine cultivars Verdelho dos Açores (Ver) and Arinto da Terceira (Ar) collected in 2009 and 2010 on A) all sampled locations, B) in Lajidos (PLJ), the remaining locations of Pico (PRL), in Biscoitos (BCT) and in Graciosa (GRC) and C) in six vineyard (numbers 5, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 19; see Table 1 ).       Yeast species isolated from final stages of fermentations  From the 57 grape samples that were collected in five islands of the Archipelago, 40 spontaneous fermentations were achieved ( Table 2 ). When the weight loss due to CO 2 release during fermentation corresponded to 70 g L -1 , a total of 1200 yeast isolates were collected at the final stages of fermentations (720 isolates from fermentations in 2009 and 480 from 2010). Thirty-one samples were predominantly fermented by S . cerevisiae (more than 75% of S . cerevisiae isolates in each sample). Ten fermentations were finished by non- Saccharomyces species ( Candida boidinii , C . glabrata , C . humilis , C . railenensis , Starmerella bacillaris , Hanseniaspora vinae , Issatchenkia hanoiensis , Kazachstania exigua , Kluyveromyces thermotoerans , Meyerozyma guilliermondii , Pichia kudriavzevii , P . terricola , Saccharomycodes ludwigii , Zygosaccharomyces bailii ). These species occurred together and in different proportions, with the exception of three fermentations that contained 100% of isolates of the species C . boidinii , C . railenensis or C . glabrata .

The species S . cerevisiae was predominant in both sampling years, corresponding to 64.5% and 87.5% of the total isolates obtained from the final stage of the fermentations performed in 2009 and 2010, respectively, independent of the grape cultivar and the island.  The species C . railenensis , S . bacillaris , M . guilliermondii and H . vineae occurred in two to five grape samples and each of these species was present only in two or three of the islands. The percentage of these species in each fermentation ranged between 6.7% and 100%. Less frequent species I . hanoiensis occurred in two fermentations from the same location (corresponding to 1.7% and 40% of the isolates). Some species occurred only in a single fermentation, representing between 66.7% and 100% of the isolates ( C . boidinii , C . glabrata and Z . bailii ) or between 10% and 24% of the isolates ( K . exigua and Lachancea thermotolerans ). Other species were rarely found, corresponding to one single isolate from a single fermentation ( C . humilis , P . terricola and S . ludwigii ).  From the 28 yeast species isolated in this study, listed in Tables 1 and 2 , only five were found both in freshly crushed grapes and at the end of fermentations: C . railenensis , S . bacillaris , I . hanoiensis , H . vinae and P . terricola ., For all but one of the grape samples, species occurring in the freshly crushed grapes did not occur at the end of the correspondent fermentation. One exception was observed for P . terricola that was isolated in both stages of the same fermentation.    Comparison between the different sampling locations  Differences in community composition between sampling locations were tested by analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) on squared root transformed species incidences. Fig 4 shows R-values, indicative of the observed rank abundance difference between locations, ranging this value from -1 to +1, with positive and negative values indicating that communities differ or not, respectively.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169883.g004  Fig 4   Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) on square root transformed species incidences, using the software PAST [ 55 ].  Statistically significant differences in yeast community composition observed between islands/locations (SMG: São Miguel, BCT: Biscoitos, GRC: Graciosa, PLJ: Lajidos, PRL: remaining locations in Pico, SJG: São Jorge). R -values are indicated in bold, and P -values in italic. Light grey and dark grey boxes refer to comparisons made with yeast species obtained in 2009 and 2010, respectively.     Concerning the year of 2009, our results show that Biscoitos and Lajidos locations harbor communities that differ from the remaining locations of the archipelago. As shown in Fig 4 , yeast communities collected in 2009 from the Lajidos location differed greatly from all islands of the Archipelago, with R-values ranging between 0.5467 (P = 0.0087) and 0.9200 (P = 0.0085). When comparing the Lajidos location with the “remaning locations in Pico”, despite a less significant difference, a positive R-value (0.1982; P = 0.085) indicates that they harbor different communities. In the first sampling year, significant differences were also found between yeast communities from Biscoitos and S. Miguel islands (R = 0.4320; P = 0.0265). However with lower significance, only positive R-values were observed from the comparison between Biscoitos with all other locations (except S. Jorge). In the second sampling year, the only significant differences between yeast communities were observed when comparing the “remaining location in Pico” with S. Jorge and Biscoitos (R = 0.5000 and 0.2682; P = 0.0276 and 0.0453), reflecting the predominance of H . uvarum in all grape samples, and the considerable decrease in species richness. Using this biodiversity index, together with Shannon index, similar results were obtained, being this analysis present in Supplementary data ( S1 Fig , S1 Table ).     Discussion  A two-year sampling plan was designed and implemented in 13 locations, in five islands of the Azores archipelago. A total of 57 grape samples from three Azorean white grapevine cultivars were collected and 40 spontaneous fermentations were achieved. A total of 2910 yeast isolates were obtained and 28 yeast species were identified. We must caution that yeast isolates were obtained through selective conditions of growth that may differ from abiotic factors found in nature. Rarely occurring or slow-growing species may not have been detected, as the detection limit of our experimental approach is 3.3% (one species in 30 isolates). Also, when sequencing only one representative per grape sample (in a total of 450 profiles sequenced), some diversity could be lost. However, we consider that our approach allows a comparison of the yeast microbiota across vineyards and islands, even though it cannot provide a complete description of yeast community composition. Already in our previous work [ 56 ], we showed that this approach allowed the comparison between grape yeast communities. In adition, it was shown that the most representative genera belonging to these communities were comparable to the ones obtained in other continental areas. A fraction of the microbiota analyzed in this study was isolated after enrichment through must fermentation, allowing the comparison of the biodiversity of species enduring fermentation.  In agreement with most of the available bibliography, also in this study only non- Saccharomyces species were isolated from freshly crushed grapes and, for the first time, C . carpophila was encountered as an inhabitant of grape or wine-associated environments. To our knowledge so far, Pichia cecembensis has been isolated from grapes only in vineyards of the Azores Archipelago, from Pico and Terceira islands in one of our previous studies [ 57 ]. In the present study, this species was also found in Graciosa and S. Jorge. The wide occurrence of this species in the Azores (although in small proportions) may represent a particularity of the yeast biota from the vineyards of the archipelago. However, this species was only recently described [ 58 ], which might also explain the lack of previous findings in other grape ecosystems. The most representative species, H . uvarum and M . pulcherrima , are often reported as the predominant species on ripe grapes, in particular in regions with warmer climates [ 5 , 8 , 9 , 22 , 59 – 61 ]. P . terricola and S . bacillaris are also commonly reported as associated with grapes and wine environments [ 23 , 46 , 62 – 65 ]. However, in this study, both species occurred in higher proportions in comparison to other wine-producing areas. On the other hand, H . opuntiae has been less frequently reported as inhabitant of grape ecosystem [ 9 , 66 – 68 ], but in our study this species corresponded to 3.5% of the total isolates from freshly crushed grapes, despite being found only in 2 samples. Interestingly, in both samples H . opuntiae was predominant (more than 96% of the isolates) and H . uvarum was not found (while it was present in 82% of the remaining 55 grape samples). A similar correlation is reported by Settanni et al . [ 9 ], pointing to a possible antagonism between strains of both species. Globally, the remaining species ( C . inconspicua , C . quercitrusa , C . railenensis , H . vineae , I . hanoiensis , P . fermentans , P . membranifaciens , S . crataegensis , S . vini and W . anomalus ) were more rarely found on the archipelago, in accordance with most bibliographic references [ 5 , 65 , 69 – 72 ]. Pichia terricola was one of the most frequently found species in freshly crushed grapes, which is in agreement with recent reports that found this yeast in all stages of must fermentations [ 7 , 73 ]. In our study, only one isolate was obtained from final stages of the fermentations, suggesting that the isolated strains may have a low ethanol resistance or a weak ability to compete with other species. The remaining species isolated from finished fermentations were present in the correspondent freshly crushed grapes samples in proportions under the detection limit of our experimental approach (3.3%—one in 30 isolates). Only after enrichment through must fermentation could they be detected, with the frequencies and proportions generally found in similar studies on other geographic locations [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 46 , 63 , 74 – 76 ]. Among them, S . cerevisiae was predominant (in 75% of the fermentations), which is in agreement with the general observation that the isolation of S . cerevisiae from sound grapes, through direct plating methods has been rarely described (reviewed by [ 77 ]).  The effect of the non- Saccharomyces species on wine quality has been widely reported [ 71 , 78 ]. A possible linkage between yeast biota and a certain vintage, a specific grape cultivar and/or a particular wine-producing region may contribute to the typical sensory profile of the correspondent wines.  When considering the great differences found in the yeast biota between the two sampling years, we must stress that climatologically, the year of 2009 was characterized by the average conditions expected for the Archipelago, whereas unusually high frequency of precipitation was recorded in 2010. Rainfalls on the central and eastern islands were 20% and 60% higher, respectively, compared to the average values of the previous 30 years. In 2010, the adverse climatic conditions, led to a decrease of more than 80% of the average wine production. Globally, the yeast biota suffered a strong reduction in the species diversity from the first to the second sampling year (23 and 15 species respectively), which can be attributed to the pronounced climatic differences between the two sampling years. However, no data for the climatic variation between islands during grapes ripening period are available, which could impact those values obtained regarding yeast communities composition. In agreement with our results, some studies found a similar correlation between rainfall and yeast biodiversity [ 3 , 79 ], although other authors had reported a higher yeast biodiversity in rainy years [ 30 , 80 ]. This fact has been attributed to the effect of antifungal treatments that are carried out with greater intensity in years with higher precipitations [ 81 ]. In fact, some studies suggest that the usage of pesticides in vineyards decrease yeast biodiversity [ 82 ], however this is not universal [ 23 , 28 , 83 , 84 ]. Our previous studies [ 57 ] on yeast communities from abandoned vineyards suggested that the decrease of yeast diversity in rainy years is rather related to climatic conditions than to the usage of fungicides. Comparing both sampling years, a bigger decrease in species richness was observed in the yeast communities from the final stage of fermentations (from 12 to 6 species) than from the freshly crushed grapes (from 14 to 11 species).  Several studies suggest that particular yeast communities may be associated with certain grape cultivars [ 22 , 25 , 46 , 61 , 73 , 75 , 85 , 86 ], however no clear patterns or robust conclusions were achieved. Other authors did not find any correlation between grape cultivar and yeast communities composition [ 79 , 87 ]. We herein show that the yeast species H . uvarum tends to occur in higher proportions on grape samples from Verdelho than from Arinto cultivars. As described in the previous section, this was observed in both sampling years and in several locations and vineyards ( Fig 3A–3C ). Similar cultivar-specific yeast occurrences have been linked to varietal factors such as the thickness of the berry skin [ 88 ], that might be related to differences in berry composition, grape ripeness and sanitary condition at the sampling moment. However, this observation corresponds to a general tendency when the yeast biota was globally analyzed. The confirmation of a linkage between higher incidence of H . uvarum and the cultivar Verdelho needs further investigation. No differences were apparent between grape cultivars concerning the predominance of other species or concerning the presence of S . cerevisiae .  The geographical location and microclimatological conditions affects the composition of yeast communities isolated from grape and fermentations [ 22 , 46 ]. In agreement with this, our study revealed qualitative and quantitative variations in the yeast flora composition, between several locations from five islands of the Azores Archipelago. The species richness varied among geographical location, independently from the grape cultivar, sampling year, or fermentation stage. The highest yeast diversity was observed in the vineyards from S. Jorge, Biscoitos and Lajidos locations, having very particular environmental characteristics, corresponding to distinctive terroirs . The soils on these locations, covered by basaltic stone or solidified lava flows, have a strong effect on the microclimate at the grape level [ 89 ]. These environmental characteristics, together with an intensive viticultural activity, might explain the observed higher species richness. Differences were also observed concerning the occurrence of the predominant species on freshly crushed grapes from these locations. For example, M . pulcherrima showed a much higher incidence ( Arinto : 95.6%; Verdelho : 83.3%) in the wine region Lajidos in comparison with the “remaining locations in Pico” (26%) in the sampling year 2009. The same was observed in the Biscoitos region of the Terceira Island concerning the proportion of P . terricola , which was considerably higher compared to the other islands of the archipelago. The statistical analysis of the yeast community composition revealed significant differences between those two locations and the rest of the archipelago. These differences were particularly accentuated in 2009, whereas the occurrence of atypical climatic conditions strongly affected grapevine growth and grapes development in the second sampling year. This may have affected yeast communities composition, and therefore differences between locations were less apparent.  This study is the first report on autochthonous yeast communities from the grapevine cultivars used in production of Azorean geographical indications wines. Considerable climate-associated variations were observed between vintages. Differences between cultivars were apparent and significant differences in yeast community composition were found between locations. In 2009 yeast communities found on freshly crushed grapes that were sampled from the locations of Lajidos and Biscoitos diverged greatly from the remaining locations of the archipelago.  Our observations strongly support the existence of a linkage between grape yeast communities and vineyards´ associated ecology. This fact is particularly true in vineyards with very distinctive environmental conditions.

Whether a visual stimulus seems near or far away depends partly on its vertical elevation. Contrasting theories suggest either that perception of distance could vary with elevation, because of memory of previous upwards efforts in climbing to overcome gravity, or because of fear of falling associated with the downwards direction. The vestibular system provides a fundamental signal for the downward direction of gravity, but the relation between this signal and depth perception remains unexplored. Here we report an experiment on vestibular contributions to depth perception, using Virtual Reality. We asked participants to judge the absolute distance of an object presented on a plane at different elevations during brief artificial vestibular inputs. Relative to distance estimates collected with the object at the level of horizon, participants tended to overestimate distances when the object was presented above the level of horizon and the head was tilted upward and underestimate them when the object was presented below the level of horizon. Interestingly, adding artificial vestibular inputs strengthened these distance biases, showing that online multisensory signals, and not only stored information, contribute to such distance illusions. Our results support the gravity theory of depth perception, and show that vestibular signals make an on-line contribution to the perception of effort, and thus of distance.

Distance can be inferred directly from visual information, using accommodation [ 1 ] and binocular cues such as vergence [ 2 ] and disparity [ 3 ]. However, distance perception is dramatically biased if the target objects are presented above or below the level of horizon. For example, a mountain refuge seems farther or closer depending on whether we look up at it from below or down at it from above [ 4 ]. Hence, purely visual information about distance may be affected by non-visual factors [ 5 , 6 ], such as fear of heights [ 4 ] or perceived effort of access [ 7 ].  Contrasting explanations have been proposed for non-visual distance biases . On the one hand, the gravity theory claims that distance perception is based on the estimated motor effort of navigating to the perceived object [ 7 , 8 ]. Accordingly upward distances are overestimated [ 9 ]. On the other hand, the evolved navigation theory posits an evolutionary advantage in overestimating the risk of falling [ 10 , 11 ]. On this view, contrary to gravity theory, downward distances are overestimated. Both theories assume that current head and gaze elevations are combined with internally-stored information in order to compute distance. Gravity theories require stored information about previous motor efforts [ 8 ], while evolved navigation theories require internal information about potential risks of falling [ 12 ]. Critically, removing the fear of falling by experimenting in low detail Virtual Reality [ 13 ] or reducing the expected effort of access by e.g. not wearing any heavy backpacks [ 9 ] reportedly diminishes these elevation distance biases.  In principle, the influence of upward/downward head inclination on distance perception could be based on online information, rather than stored information. In particular, under terrestrial conditions, the vestibular system constantly provides signals relating current head orientation to the direction of gravity. Combining a vestibular signal with an eye position signal specifies whether a visual object is located above or below the eye. Although vestibular signals do not directly code the spatial location of external objects, the interaction between vestibular and visual information is essential in providing the organism with space representation [ 14 – 16 ]. For instance, vestibular peripheral organs detect the motion of the head, producing experiences of self-motion in three-dimensional space. Cortical vestibular pathways integrate information from other sensory modalities to generate appropriate and accurate responses to self-motion, such as the stabilization of gaze, balance and postural motor commands [ 17 ], and the perception of the subjective visual vertical [ 18 ]. Microgravity experiments showed that visual perception of horizontal depth is influenced by altered vestibular signals [ 19 ]. For example, perceived distances were underestimated during either short-term exposure to microgravity using parabolic flight [ 20 ] or long term exposure on the International Space Station [ 21 ] leading to perceptual distortions of three dimensional space. However, the vestibular contribution to elevation biases in visual depth perception remains under-investigated.  Recent studies indicated that reaching an object can be affected by the posture of the body [ 6 ]. Tilting the body forward caused errors in the reaching movement, because participants underestimated the distance between their own body and the virtual object. These results seem to support the gravity based model. Similarly, Harris and Mander [ 5 ] reported that tilting the body backward caused overestimation of the perceived length of a rod, and hence, the wall seemed presumably closer. However, these studies do not specify under which circumstances one expects underestimation vs. overestimation, and why.  Here we asked participants to judge the distance of an object presented at different distances on an inclined plane, leading to different head and gaze elevations. We developed a novel Virtual Reality environment in which neither risks of falling [ 22 ], nor navigational effort were actually present [ 23 ]. This minimised confounds such as familiarity, and memory for previous efforts, that could affect previous field-based experiments. The participants’ head inclination was systematically varied by asking them to tilt both the head and gaze upwards or downwards to fixate a target object. We could thus directly compare predictions of gravity and evolved navigation theories. Further, we applied event-related galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) during each judgement, to investigate whether online vestibular signals indeed affected the distance perception biases. Importantly, GVS is a non-invasive method that directly stimulates the vestibular receptors [ 24 ], producing complex oculomotor, perceptual and postural responses. In the traditional bilateral bipolar GVS configuration, an anode and cathode are placed on the left and right mastoid, or vice versa. Perilymphatic cathodal currents are thought to depolarize the trigger site and lead to excitation, whereas anodal currents hyperpolarize it resulting in inhibition [ 25 ]. This is considered to enhance the vestibular activity by mimicking a natural movement of the head, which elicits a virtual sensation of roll tilt.    Methods   Ethics Statement  The experimental protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (University College London) and the study was conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants gave written informed consent to participate in the experiment before inclusion in the experiment.    Participants  Sixteen healthy participants volunteered for the study. Data from two participants was discarded because they proved unable to follow the instruction of the experiment (see below). Thus, fourteen participants (5 females, mean age ± standard deviation: 26.64 ± 6.64 years) completed the experiment. All participants were right-handed according to their Edinburgh handedness inventory scores. The sample size was decided a priori based on similar experiments [ 5 , 6 ].    Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation  Bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was applied using a commercial stimulator (Good Vibrations Engineering Ltd., Nobleton, Ontario, Canada) delivering a boxcar pulse of 1mA for 3s. This low intensity was used to minimise non-specific cueing effects, such as arousal from cutaneous sensations or vertigo. Importantly, several studies confirm that this level of GVS activates the vestibular organs. For instance, both postural [ 24 ] and behavioural changes have been reported with such low intensities GVS [ 26 – 30 ]. GVS is known to increase the firing rate in vestibular afferents on the cathodal side and to decrease the firing rate on the anodal side [ 25 ], enhancing the ongoing natural vestibular responses and evoking virtual sensations of roll tilt. These effects do not outlast the stimulation [ 31 ]. Carbon rubber electrodes (area 10 cm 2 ) coated with electrode gel were placed binaurally over the mastoid processes and fixed in place with adhesive tape. The area of application was first cleaned, and electrode gel was applied to reduce the impedance. Left anodal and right cathodal configuration is named ‘L-GVS’ ( Fig 1B ). The inverse polarity, namely right anodal and left cathodal configuration, is named ‘R-GVS’. We also applied a sham stimulation using electrodes placed on the left and right side of the neck, about 5cm below the GVS electrodes [ 32 , 33 ] with left anodal and right cathodal configuration. This sham stimulation evoked similar tingling skin sensations to GVS but not modulation of vestibular afferents. It thus provided a control for non-specific alerting effects and for the knowledge that an unusual stimulation is occurring.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169990.g001  Fig 1   Experimental set up and results.  (a) Participants were seated in the centre of the cave. During the experiment, participants made absolute judgements of the distance between their own body and an object (a gift box) appearing in front of them. The positions of the gift box were distributed logarithmically between 5m and 25m. The same distances were presented with the three head inclinations -20°, 0°, and +20°. The gaze was aligned with head inclinations. (b) Left anodal and right cathodal configuration is named ‘L-GVS’. The inverse polarity, namely right anodal and left cathodal configuration, is named ‘R-GVS’. A sham stimulation was also applied placing the electrodes to the left and right side of the neck about 5cm below the GVS electrodes. GVS and sham stimulation were applied delivering a boxcar pulse of 1ma for 3s. (c) Distance errors have been calculated by subtracting the actual distance from the judged distance. Estimation bias in 0° head inclination condition was used as baseline, and all values were corrected by this baseline. Thus, negative values on the ordinate indicate underestimation compared to the horizontal, zero-inclination baseline condition, whereas positive values indicate overestimations. Distance perception varied significantly according head inclination. Specifically, downward distances were underestimated, while upward distances were overestimated, relative to baseline. This pattern of distance illusions is in line with the predictions of the gravity theories. Note that GVS enhances this pattern. (d) Predictions based on linear mixed-effects model. The model containing both fixed and random terms fits well to the actual data.       Virtual Reality Environment  The experiment was carried out in the Immersive Virtual Reality Laboratory at University College London, using a CAVE facility [ 34 ]. This system consists of four stereo-projected surfaces: three back-projected vertical walls, each 3m wide x 2.2m high, and the floor (3m x 3m) form a continuous projection surface. The Virtual Reality environment was created using Unity3D game engine ( www.unity3d.com ), rendered using a K5000 graphics card to drive 4 Christie Mirage DLP projectors, each of which projected to one of the 4 screens at 96Hz. The participant wore shutter glasses synchronized with the projectors creating active stereo-projection in each eye at 48Hz. The glasses provided a field of view per eye of approx. 90–100° horizontally and 60–70° vertically (the precise field of view depends to some extent on how closely the glasses fitted to the participant’s eyes). The position of the glasses was tracked by an InterSense™ IS-900 system with high accuracy. The system was calibrated to the participant’s own eye height at the beginning of every experiment, and this data was used to accurately compute object distances for the upward, downward, and level inclinations. This calibration was performed to account for small changes in eye-to-ground distance among participants. A geometrical model accounting for the pitch of the ground plane and the eye-height of the participant ensured that the distance from the participant's eye to the near-top edge of the target object was identical for both upward and downward pitched objects (as well as among participants with different eye-heights). The virtual scene was a green grass-like plane with blue skies and no visible landmarks. The experimental object was a 2m X 2m gift box with purple ribbon (see Fig 1A ). The object rested on the ground and the same proportion of object and environment was visible at all inclinations. The unusual size of the target object was chosen to be appropriate for the range of distances presented in the experiment and the consequent visual angle subtended by the target object at these distances. As the distance was varied between 5m and 25m, and the object had 2m sides, the visual angle subtended varied between 23° and 4.6°.    Experimental Procedure  Verbal and written instructions about the task were given to participants prior to the experiment. Participants were seated in the centre of the CAVE, 1.5m from the front screen. A visual scene was presented on vertical screens and on the floor in order to create a seamless, wide field-of-view immersive display. Participants made absolute judgements about the distance between their own body and an object (a gift box) that appeared in front of them ([ 35 ], see Fig 1A ). At the beginning of the task, the target object was displayed for few minutes to allow participants to familiarise with its size. Then object positions slightly under (1.5m) and slightly over (30m) the experimental range were presented, and the experimenter informed the participant about the actual distance in metres.  Participants were encouraged to use these as anchor points to calibrate distance judgements in experimental trials. The positions of the present box were distributed logarithmically between 5m and 25m; thus, the possible distances were 5, 6.9, 9.52, 13.3, 18.2, 25m. These distances were chosen to produce a wide range of perceived distances. Our predictions did not focus on the effects of object distance itself but rather on the effects of two other experimental factors: head inclination and vestibular stimulation. Participants were instructed to look horizontally relative to the head and visual ground plane, but the angle of the head was manipulated across experimental conditions. The object appeared on a smooth plane that was inclining (+20°), flat (0°), or declining (-20°), and participants were asked to tilt their head accordingly (backwards, natural and downwards). The experiment was divided into blocks; head inclination (+20°, 0°, -20°) and vestibular stimulation (L-GVS, R-GVS, Sham) changed only between blocks. Each block consisted of 18 trials; there were three repetitions of the same distance in each block. Distances were presented in random order. Block order followed a Latin square design. Each trial started with the presentation of the grass-like plane in the actual inclination and the blue sky. Participants adjusted their head pitch angle to fixate the object and, therefore, the horizon, while a 6 degrees head tracking system monitored their posture. This procedure ensured that participants saw the same proportion of grass and sky at all head inclinations. The head tracking system measured the inclination of the head and a sound signalled when the participant’s head reached the correct vertical angle. Thus, the head position in space was decoded by our custom-built software for presenting stimuli, which started each trial if and only if participants’ head was in the correct inclination. Participants were told to keep their head at the same position for the duration of the block. Then GVS/Sham started and lasted for 3s. 1s after GVS onset, the gift box became visible for 1s and then disappeared. This delay was used to ensure that vestibular cortical projections would be activated when visual stimulus was present: Fitzpatrick and Day [ 24 ] reported that 1s of 1mA GVS produced clear postural adjustments in standing participants, implying successful activation of the vestibular system. The image was then blurred, and the GVS/Sham pulse ended. Participants made absolute verbal judgements (in metres) of the distance of the object after the screen was blurred. The response was recorded, and the next trial started. This method of reporting distance percepts has high face validity, and allows many estimates to be acquired rapidly. It was thus preferred to the method of limits and method of constant stimuli favoured in classical psychophysical studies. Very importantly, any imprecision or bias resulting from this method of measurement should affect all GVS conditions equally. We did not aim to quantify the limits of visual distance perception, but only to compare estimates of perceived visual distance between GVS conditions. We wanted to sample a range of environmental distances to minimise the number of GVS stimulations (GVS can cause mildly unpleasant sensations) and to minimise duration of the CAVE immersion. Absolute judgements might be criticised because different participants may use different subjective standards. However, our experimental design was based only on within-participant comparisons; therefore, differences between individuals in reported values do not affect our inferences.     Results  Trials containing either recording errors or multiple responses were eliminated before the analysis. Less than one percent of all participants’ data was removed according to this criterion. We calculated the distance judgement errors by subtracting the simulated distance from the judged distance (see S1 File ). We inspected the distribution of errors expressed both in metres, and as a percentage of the actual distance. The former distribution was normal, whereas the latter was left-skewed. We therefore preferred to express errors in physical units (m). The distance bias in the 0° head inclination condition, corresponding to horizontal gaze, was been considered as baseline, which allowed us to define underestimation (negative values) and overestimation (positive values) relative to it.  First, distance judgement errors for each participant were averaged for each combination of head inclination and vestibular stimulation conditions and analysed using factorial repeated measures ANOVA and planned contrasts. Our theoretical predictions focused on the interaction between head inclination and vestibular stimulation factors. These analyses therefore pooled across the different distances judged. Distance perception varied significantly across head inclinations ( F (2,26) = 23.694; p < .001; η p 2 = 0.65) ( Fig 1C ). Overall estimations showed a slight underestimation trend, but only estimations in the -20° head inclination condition were significantly underestimated compared to actual distances ( t (13) = -2.75, p = .02, Cohen’s d = -1.52, all other p > .3). Downward distances were underestimated by 1.65m ( SD = 3.50), while upward distances were overestimated by 1.19m ( SD = 3.90), compared to ground level. This pattern of results fits the predictions of gravity theories but opposes the predictions of evolved navigation theories. A planned linear trend contrast confined to the sham condition also showed a trend in the direction predicted by gravity theories (down vs. up head inclination t (1,13) = 1.670; p = .059, Cohen’s d = 0.45, one-tailed, numerical effect present in 10/14 participants). The corresponding planned contrast for evolved navigation was not supported (flat vs down head inclination: t (1,13) = -1.274, n.s.). The main effect of vestibular stimulation was not significant ( F (2,26) = 0.196; p = .823). However, and more importantly, we found an interaction between vestibular stimulation condition and head inclination ( F (4,52) = 3.318; p = .017; η p 2 = 0.20). This interaction occurred because the linear trend predicted by gravity theories was amplified by both polarities of GVS (down vs. up head inclination L-GVS t (1,13) = 4.891, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.31; R-GVS t (1,13) = 6.585, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.76, numerical effect averaged across GVS polarities present in 14/14 participants). This pattern of results is consistent with an inclination effect generated online by a vestibular signal that is boosted by artificial vestibular stimulation.  Second, we fitted a mixed effects model to investigate intersubject variability, following Barr et al [ 36 ]. In this mixed effects approach, we entered head inclination (-20°, 0°, 20°) and object position as scalar variables [ 37 ], while vestibular stimulation (L-GVS, R-GVS, Sham) was handled as factorial. Mixed effects modelling was performed in R [ 38 ] using lme4 [ 37 ]; ggplot2 was adopted for visualisation [ 39 ].  We inspected how distance judgement errors varied as a function of object position for each participant ( Fig 2 ). We observed a strong correlation between object distance and judgement error within most participants, together with strong differences between participants in the strength and even the sign of these correlations. This pattern of variation justifies the explicit modelling of both fixed and random effects provided by the mixed model approach [ 36 ]. We included both fixed (i.e. population general) and random (i.e. subject specific) effects of head inclination, object position and vestibular stimulation [ 37 , 40 ]. We aimed to keep maximal random effect structure in the model [ 36 ], therefore random intercepts were estimated for individual subjects, individual subject and vestibular stimulation combinations, individual subject and inclination combinations, and individual subject, vestibular stimulation and inclination combinations. Random slope is only estimated for the object position, but separate random slopes (correlated with their respective intercepts) were estimated for different random intercept terms. For this model the restricted maximum likelihood (RMEL) estimation reached convergence. This model appeared to fit our data well according to the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) of 3243.747 (df = 31, baseline model containing no fixed effects, and only the subjects as random effects resulted in AIC 5211.152). The fixed effect significances were tested using F tests, where p values were based on the Kenward-Roger approximation of the degrees of freedom [ 41 ]. We found a significant main effect of head inclination ( F (2, 26.17) = 23.70, p < .001, η p 2 = 0.64) and a main effect of object position ( F (1, 19.87) = 41.75, p < .001, η p 2 = 0.68). Critically, the interaction between head inclination and vestibular stimulation was significant ( F (4, 52.92) = 3.68, p = .010, η p 2 = 0.22). The pattern of interaction was consistent with an involvement of vestibular gravitational signals in distance estimates, with the effects of actual distance on reported distance being greater with GVS than in Sham. Least square means post hoc contrasts revealed significant differences between -20° and 20° head inclination conditions in the Sham ( p = .035). Finally, the three way interaction between head inclination, vestibular stimulation, and object position was also significant ( F (4, 67.56) = 39.10, p < .001, η p 2 = 0.70), primarily due to changes in slopes estimated for some head inclination and vestibular stimulation combinations. The overall model explained more than 80% of total variance in the data ( Conditional R 2 = 0.82) with a compelling contribution of the fixed effects ( Marginal R 2 = 0.23) ( Fig 1D ). The difference between conditional and marginal R 2 indicates how much variance is present on the subject level and captured by the random effects in our model. This suggests that our mixed effects model fitted well with the observed data, and validated hierarchical modelling of the experimental variable.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169990.g002  Fig 2   Relation between object position and judgement error in individual participants.  See text for explanation. Note that the size and even direction of the relation differs between participants.     To summarise, the ANOVA and the mixed effects model showed converging results. Downward distances were underestimated, whereas upward distances were overestimated compared to estimations made on flat surface. Furthermore, GVS enhanced these biases.    Discussion  Participants overestimated visual distances when their head was tilted upward and underestimated them when their head was tilted downward, compared to judgements made in a zero-degree, horizontal baseline condition. The observed effect is in the direction predicted by gravity theories, but opposite to the predictions of evolved navigation theories. More strikingly, the distance biases increased strongly with event-related GVS. Our results suggest that the gravitational modulation of visual distance perception depends on on-line vestibular signals. This elevation distance bias is, therefore, not merely a product of learned contextual associations but rather reflects a specific multisensory integration mechanism.  Gravitational signals are coded by vestibular receptors in the inner ear, whose signal depends on the position of the head relative to gravitational vertical [ 42 , 43 ]. The precise mode of action of GVS remains debated, but recent evidence confirms activation of both otolithic fibres and semicircular canals [ 44 ]. In the bilateral bipolar GVS configuration, perilymphatic cathodal currents are thought to depolarize the trigger site and lead to excitation, whereas anodal currents hyperpolarize it resulting in inhibition [ 25 ]. Neuroimaging studies using GVS have revealed widespread vestibular projections reaching many areas of the cerebral cortex, such as the retroinsular cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, the temporo-parietal cortex, the basal ganglia and the anterior cingulate [ 45 , 46 ]. Critically, recent studies suggested that otolithic gravitational inputs in the vestibular system have a direct influence on cognitive tasks involving three-dimensional perception [ 5 , 6 , 14 , 15 ]. In particular, perception of depth was altered in microgravity and in peripheral vestibular disorders [ 15 , 47 ]. However, these results were attributed to changes in visual linear perspective and visual size perception, which should be specific to visual horizontal stimuli. Our data suggest an alternative mechanism for these effects. We found that artificial activation of vestibular projections in the brain by GVS modulated distance illusions. The pattern of modulation suggests that GVS amplified the neural signals generated by head and gaze elevation changes required to fixate targets above or below the ground plane [ 48 , 49 ]. Our results therefore suggest that vestibular inputs contribute to an on-line representation of head movement and position which is used in estimation of visual distance.  Gaze position and the perceived orientation of the ground plane are already known to contribute to perceived depth [ 49 , 50 ]. Critically, these factors both depend on head position, suggesting a fundamental interaction between visual, vestibular and proprioceptive signals in computing distance estimates. Combining traditional visual cues to depth, such as accommodation and vergence, with vestibular signals about current head position relative to gravity provides sufficient information to compute a possible motion path to a visual object [ 17 ], as suggested by navigation theories. In our study, participants overestimated distances when their head was tilted upward and underestimated them when their head was tilted downward compared to estimates in the horizontal plane. This distance perceptual bias was enhanced with event-related GVS. Interestingly, GVS did not interfere with distance perception when head inclination was zero. Presumably, when the head is level and not inclined, the brain computes distances to visual targets with respect to an assumed level ground. This represents an intermediate, neutral situation where there is neither cost nor benefit of gravity (cf [ 7 , 8 , 51 ]). In this special case, the online vestibular-gravitational signal generated by GVS does not need to be integrated.  Importantly, although the current results supported the predictions of the gravity theory, we do not suggest a globally linear relation between head inclination and distance error. In fact, not all possible angles are equally experienced in real environments [ 9 , 52 ]. Our experience of inclines typically involves either slight elevations (e.g. road gradients are usually under 20 degrees) or risky, non-navigable surfaces (e.g. the sheer drop from a balcony). One might expect the biases of evolved navigation theory to be most apparent for dramatic elevation angles associated with dangerous environments.  Verbal reporting of absolute distance judgements was used in the present study. This does not figure among the classical psychophysical methods. However, it has been used earlier [ 53 , 54 ]. The results of those studies were broadly similar to others that used other measures to assess distance estimation [ 55 – 57 ]. The verbal method has the advantage of being extremely rapid. This is important in environments such as VR, where long exposure is uncomfortable and impractical. Although absolute response accuracy may be low, this need not obscure the difference between our experimental conditions [ 58 – 61 ]. Thus, it seems very unlikely that the particular features of this psychophysical judgement can explain our results, unless additional and unwarranted ad hoc assumptions are made.  We cannot exclude that the difference between estimated distances and actual distances might have been influenced by some parameters used in our study. For instance, visual distance perception seems to rely on the familiar size of the to-be-estimated object [ 62 ]. We adopted an unusual large box to account for the visual angles subtended by the object at far distances. A large object is therefore required to avoid further uncertainty in the distance judgments, especially at greater distances. The size of our box might have affected distance perception in general , but not specifically at some head inclinations or vestibular stimulation conditions.  Previous accounts of visual distance perception identified a gravitational bias. Some views treat these as top-down, cognitive biases, which may therefore be post-perceptual. For example, the perceived effort to climb to overcome gravity may lead to the summit of a slope seeming far away [ 52 ]. In our experiment these cognitive factors were minimized: in VR there is no actual effort of movement, nor any fear of falling. Our results suggest that upward slope visual distances are overestimated compared to ground level, and we provide novel, causal evidence of why this might be so. We show that gravitational modulation of visual distance perception depends on on-line vestibular signals. Previous accounts emphasised memory of past experiences of efforts to overcome gravity, or potential effects of gravity in falling. That is, those accounts treated vertical biases in distance perception as results of prior learning, or as predictions, rather than as on-line modulations of perception. Since concurrent, event-related artificial vestibular inputs boosted visual distance illusions, these illusions may not simply be products of learned and internally-stored contextual associations. Rather, such illusions may owe more to multisensory perceptual integration than has been previously thought.    Supporting Information   S1 File   Data from the experiment in *.csv format.

Bacterial adaptation to different hosts requires transcriptomic alteration in response to the environmental conditions. Laribacter hongkongensis is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, urease-positive bacillus caused infections in liver cirrhosis patients and community-acquired gastroenteritis. It was also found in intestine from commonly consumed freshwater fishes and drinking water reservoirs. Since L . hongkongensis could survive as either fish or human pathogens, their survival mechanisms in two different habitats should be temperature-regulated and highly complex. Therefore, we performed transcriptomic analysis of L . hongkongensis at body temperatures of fish and human in order to elucidate the versatile adaptation mechanisms coupled with the temperatures. We identified numerous novel temperature-induced pathways involved in host pathogenesis, in addition to the shift of metabolic equilibriums and overexpression of stress-related proteins. Moreover, these pathways form a network that can be activated at a particular temperature, and change the physiology of the bacteria to adapt to the environments. In summary, the dynamic of transcriptomes in L . hongkongensis provides versatile strategies for the bacterial survival at different habitats and this alteration prepares the bacterium for the challenge of host immunity.

Gene expression and post-transcriptional regulation are two of the most common modulating strategies in bacteria particularly in response to environmental stimuli such as temperature change or alternation of the habitats, as they provide a quick response for the survival and adaptation to the changing conditions [ 2 ]. In the last decade, systematic analysis of transcriptome using RNA-Seq allowed genome-wide quantification of transcripts at various conditions from different habitats, and therefore enhanced our understanding of the bacterial adaptation and survival strategies [ 3 – 6 ].  Laribacter hongkongensis is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and S-shaped asaccharolytic, belonging to the Chromobacteriaceae family of β-proteobacteria [ 7 ]. It was firstly isolated and identified from the blood and thoracic empyema pus cultures in an alcoholic liver cirrhosis patient in Hong Kong [ 8 ]. Moreover, it was also found in association with community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler’s diarrhea, and is likely to be globally distributed as suggested by the travel histories from patients [ 9 – 12 ]. Apart from acting as infectious agent in human, L . hongkongensis is also capable to infect zebrafish through dermal abrasion or intraperitoneal injection. Infected zebrafish died in dose-dependent manner with distinguishing clinicopathological characteristics such as lethargy and abdominal hemorrhage. These features supported the Koch’s postulates for L . hongkongensis to be an fish infectious agent [ 13 ]. L . hongkongensis has been widely found in intestine (60%) from commonly consumed freshwater fish of the carp family, drinking water reservoirs and Chinese tiger frogs in Hong Kong as well as little egrets in Hangzhou [ 14 – 16 ]. Nevertheless, the capability to adapt to different environmental conditions that guarantees the survival of L . hongkongensis in diverse host and habitats is still largely unknown.  Previously, we sequenced the genome of L . hongkongensis (HLHK9) and identified unique genetic elements that are responsible for surviving under various external stimulations such as pH, osmotic pressure and oxidative stress [ 17 – 19 ]. Moreover, proteomic and gene regulatory studies of two arc gene cassettes as well as two copies of the argA and argB genes in L . hongkongensis at two physiologically relevant temperatures (37°C for human body temperature and 20°C for freshwater habitat temperature) revealed its acid resistance mechanisms under anaerobic and acidic conditions [ 19 – 22 ]. Although a number of evidence displayed the complex and versatile adaptation to different body temperatures of niches, systematic transcriptomic studies have not yet been carried out. Here we present the global transcriptomic analysis of L . hongkongensis using RNA-Seq at the temperature of 20°C and 37°C, mimicking the body temperatures of fish and human. We identified several important pathways involved in the adaptation of L . hongkongensis to the shift of metabolic equilibriums and over-expression of stress-related proteins. Moreover, these temperature-induced gene expressions adjusted the physiology of bacteria in order to survive at different habitats. In conclusion, our findings provided insight into the bacterial adaptation to the host temperature, which may ultimately contribute to the prevention and treatment of L . hongkongensis infection.    Materials and Methods   Bacterial strain and growth conditions  L . hongkongensis HLHK9, a clinical isolate from a Hong Kong patient who had severe gastroenteritis, was shared from Patrick Woo’s Lab. Bacteria strain was grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) or BHI agar at either 20°C or 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm. Bacterial cell density was measured by optical density at 600 nm.    Growth curve measurement  L . hongkongensis was cultured in 100mL fresh BHI broth at 20°C or 37°C. The optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of the culture was measured by Spectrophotometer (UV mini-1240) every 1 hour until it reached stationary phase. The growth curve was plotted using time as x-axis and absorbance at 600 nm as y-axis. The absorbance at each time point was calculated by taking the mean of triplicate value. Doubling time of bacteria was determined by period of time to grow from exponential phase to stationary (OD 600 1 to OD 600 2).    RNA extraction, library construction, RNA sequencing and data analysis  Cells at mid-log phase (OD 600 ~1.2) were harvested and subjected to total RNA extraction for RNA sequencing. Briefly, 50 mL cell pellet was lysed with 2 mL TE buffer containing 20 mg/mL lysozyme (Sigma) and 0.4 mg/mL Proteinase K solution (Ambion) for 10 minutes. The cell suspension was further lysed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for 5 minutes. Cell lysate was then mixed with chloroform; total RNA was separated from aqueous phase and precipitated with isopropanol (Sigma). Extracted RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion) and purified using acidic phenol-chloroform (Ambion) to remove genomic DNA. The RNA was then subjected to MICROBExpress Kit (Ambion) and Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kits (Epicentre) to eliminate rRNA according to manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA quality and quantity were monitored by Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Life Technologies). The library was constructed with Ion Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Ambion) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA was next sequenced using Ion Torrent sequencing platform on Ion 318 Chips (Life Technologies).  Raw sequence data with 5% unknown nucleotides or in low abundance at two temperatures were filtered to reduce false positives brought by random errors. We adopted Phred-scaled base quality scores (Q20) to minimize incorrect bases since this cutoff scores provided Base Call Accuracy up to 99%. Processed reads were mapped onto L . hongkongensis HLHK9 genome (GenBank accession: NC_012559.1) using TMAP [ 23 – 27 ] with default parameters. The mapped sequencing reads were then visualized in Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) [ 28 , 29 ]. Gene expression was normalized to RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) from reads that mapped on the gene strand within 175 bp prior to start codon to 75 bp after stop codon. RPKM = 10 9 R/NL that R is the number of reads mapped, N is the total number of mapped reads, and L is the length of gene region. The sequencing data has been deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (accession number: SRR5053677 and SRR5053678).    Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)  Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), followed by TURBO DNase (Ambion) treatment and incubated with inactivation reagent (Ambion) to inactivate DNase. One μg treated RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies). Primers for qRT-PCR were designed with Primer3 software [ 30 ] and listed in S1 Table with rpoB as the endogenous control. The PCR was run on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (ABI) with a default program as 50°C 2 min, 95°C 10 min for 1 cycle, and 95°C 15 s, 60°C 1 min for 40 cycles. The relative expression level (REL) were calculated by Ct values from all qRT-PCR reactions in triplicate using formula 2 -△△Ct .     Results and Discussion   Genome-wide analysis of transcriptome at 37°C and 20°C  We performed transcriptome sequencing to compare gene expression of L . hongkongensis grown at two physiological temperatures. In our RNA-seq, total reads were 5,391,268 and 5,142,669 at 37°C and 20°C respectively. The average read lengths were 108 bp and 112 bp at 37°C and 20°C respectively. In order to evaluate the influence of temperature in growth kinetics, we measured the optical density at 20°C and 37°C ( Fig 1 ). The doubling time was 1 hour and 15 minutes at 37°C and extended to 3 hours and 15 minutes at 20°C, indicating the growth rate was two times faster at 37°C. Bacteria on the same logarithmic phase (OD 600 ~1.2) at both temperature were collected for RNA-seq. Differentially expressed genes that were in low abundance at both temperatures were removed. More than 90% read counts were qualified and mapped to the genome of L . hongkongensis (HLHK9, accession number NC_012559.1). According to the mapping result ( S1 Fig ), more than 70% of reads were mapped to the coding region. Intriguingly, 10% of total reads were mapped to regions that are either intergenic regions or anti-sense to the coding regions, and they are possibly the non-coding or small RNAs.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169998.g001  Fig 1   The growth curve of L. hongkongensis at 20°C and 37°C.  Vertical error bars represented standard deviation of biological triplicate.     To define the differential gene expression between two temperatures, we set the threshold of fold change as |log 2 (37°C/20°C)| > 1. Subsequently, 363 and 482 genes were identified as up-regulated genes at 20°C and 37°C respectively, which accounts for 11% and 15% of total genome in L . hongkongensis . The abundance of differential expressed genes was similar to other genome-wide studies of bacteria that approximately 10% of genes are responsible for temperature adaptation in bacteria [ 31 ]. We further categorized the distribution of differentially expressed genes based on their functions and pathway in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [ 32 ] as shown in Fig 2 . Overall, genes involved in carbohydrate, energy and lipid metabolic pathways, and cofactors, vitamins and other amino acids metabolism were upregulated at 20°C than those at 37°C. On the contrary, higher number of elevated gene expression in metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, nucleotide metabolism, membrane transport and signal transduction pathways were observed at 37°C compared with 20°C. Indeed, more than 50% of genes in every functional pathway showed no significant changes which indicated that the bacteria often keep the minimum disturbance to transcriptomic equilibrium in response to external stimuli and it will prevent the cell from causing severe energy consumption and any harmful side effect [ 31 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0169998.g002  Fig 2   Gene categories distribution of differentially expressed genes in KEGG pathway at 20°C and 37°C.  Bars represented the abundance of genes up-regulated at 20°C (blue), 37°C (orange) and no expression difference (grey) in each category.     In order to further confirm the accuracy of RNA-seq data, we performed the quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to validate several genes that showed differential expression in three biological samples. Genes in different metabolic pathways with log2 (37°C/20°C) between ±1 and ± 4 in RNA-seq were selected for validation. As shown in S2 Fig , differential gene expression between RNA-seq and qRT-PCR showed positive correlation (R 2 > 0.9) in the linear regression analysis among 17 genes, suggesting the changes obtained in our RNA-seq were consistent and reproducible in biological samples.  In S2 Table , we also compared the consistency of changes between transcripts level in RNA-seq and protein level from our previous proteomic study [ 20 ]. We found that more than 70% of the genes (8 out of 11 genes, 72%) showed the same regulatory pattern in both transcriptomic and proteomic studies. This positive correlation indicated similar expression level changes in both RNA and protein of L . hongkongensis after the stimuli of the environmental changes.  Overall, we identified numerous genomic cassettes including urease biosynthesis, terminal reductase, iron acquisition and efflux activity, in which their gene expression levels were coupled to particular temperatures. Under the same scale, genes in these cassettes were preferentially expressed at either 20°C or 37°C, suggesting the important role of the particular pathways involved in the adaptation of L . hongkongensis to different habitats. A model describing the temperature-induced gene network was shown in Fig 3 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0169998.g003  Fig 3   Model of temperature-induced pathways involved in host pathogenesis.  Gene operons induced at 20°C and 37°C were drawn in blue and red region respectively.       Differential expression pattern of L . hongkongensis in response to temperature stress  L . hongkongensis was often found in various hosts which live at different temperatures such as fishes, frogs and human, indicating the versatility of this bacterium to change its physiology in adapting different conditions. To cluster the proteins of particular pathways or functions with differential expression patterns, we plotted the graphs of expression levels at two different temperatures in a log scale ( Fig 4 ). The protein groups above or below the dot lines represented the high expression level at 37°C or 20°C respectively whereas those inside the two dot lines had no significant changes between two temperatures. As shown in Fig 4 , the drastic changes in temperature induced the cold and heat shock response systems to adjust the physiological equilibrium of bacteria for adaptation. For example, the cold shock related proteins including HscA, HscB (LHK_02861, LHK_02862) and the cold shock transcription factor CspA (LHK_00932) were upregulated (2.4 to 4.9-fold) at 20°C whereas the expression level of heat shock proteins such as DnaJ/DnaK/GrpE chaperone complex (LHK_02738-LHK_02740), GroEL-GroES chaperonin complex (LHK_00659-LHK_00660) and HslV/HsIU protease (LHK_00004, LHK_00005) were elevated (1.7 to 2.7-fold) at 37°C. Moreover, we found that the homologous of stress protein UspA (LHK_00487, LHK_00590) and several stress response proteins (LHK_01454, LHK_01835, LHK_03102) were upregulated dramatically at 37°C (4.2 to 6.8-fold). UspA is one of the universal stress proteins that extensively studied, and is always induced by a plethora of environmental stressors such as starvation and high temperature in order to protect the organism [ 33 , 34 ]. Intriguingly universal stress proteins were demonstrated to play role in the actions of adhesion, motility and biofilm formation in Escherichia coli [ 35 ] as well as the persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within human host [ 36 ], indicating the induction of USP at human host temperature not only regulates genes in various cellular pathways to protect bacteria under extreme temperatures but also increases the virulence and become more invasive during infection. In L . hongkongensis , the upregulation of USP at 37°C possibly utilizes the similar strategy to activate the virulence factors and enhance the pathogenicity during human infection.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169998.g004  Fig 4   The relative expression of genes known to be related to heat shock, cold shock, stress response protein and two component systems were compared at 20°C and 37°C by RNA-seq.  Each square represents for a single gene, is categorized according to its function. The dashed lines represent a 2-fold over-expression at 37°C (upper line) and 20°C (lower line) conditions.     Apart from cold and heat-shock protein, two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) is also essential to sense and respond to various external conditions in bacteria. The systems consist of histidine kinase for sensing external stimulus and the corresponding regulator for altering gene expression to adapt to external stress [ 37 ]. In our RNA-seq, we found that some TCSs including PhoB/PhoR and LHK_02501/LHK_02502 were upregulated at lower temperature. As shown in Fig 4 , 3-fold enhancement of Pho regulon including sensor phoBR and the phosphate—specific transporter pstBACS operon were observed at freshwater temperature. Histidine kinase PhoR phosphorylates the corresponding regulator PhoB according to external phosphate concentration to activate transcription of Pho regulon including pstBACS operon and overexpress PstBACS protein. The PstBACS protein then acts as a phosphate-specific transporter for transferring inorganic phosphate from periplasm to cytosol under phosphate starvation [ 38 ]. Since aquatic environment is generally considered as lacked of phosphate [ 39 ], stimulation of pstBACS operon may assist the bacteria for survival. In addition, Pho regulon was reported to modify lipid A and fatty acid composition [ 40 ]. Interestingly, several genes related to the metabolic process of peptidoglycan, which is the major component of cell wall, including mtlD , mrcA and slt were also upregulated at 20°C. Maintaining membrane integrity and fluidity is one of the adaptation strategies during cold shock [ 41 , 42 ]. The activation of Pho regulon and upregulation of peptidoglycan metabolism possibly modify the membrane lipid composition and ante-iso/iso branching pattern to retain membrane integrity at lower temperature.  Two component systems have been shown to play significant roles for cold tolerance in bacteria [ 43 ]. The DesK/DesR proteins of Bacillus subtilis , for example, can induce genes for membrane fluidity modification at low temperature [ 44 ]. LHK_02501/LHK_02502 are proteins containing histidine kinase and response regulator receiver domain, integrating as a putative two-component system. Upregulation of this regulon at 20°C (12 and 14 fold respectively) in our result suggested the possible function of cold-induced transcriptional regulator in L . hongkongensis .    Temperature-regulated dynamic physiological switching in L . hongkongensis  In bacterial respiration, electrons are transported from electron donor to terminal electron acceptor across cytoplasmic membrane to generate a proton gradient. During aerobic respiration, oxygen is the main electron acceptor to be reduced to water via cytochrome o or cytochrome d oxidases [ 45 ]. On the other hand, bacteria reduce other electron acceptors such as nitrate, nitrite, DMSO and fumarate into nitrite, ammonium, DMS and succinate respectively during anaerobic respiration [ 46 ]. In our transcriptome analysis, several anaerobic respiration related enzymes were upregulated significantly at 37°C, in particular the expression of anaerobic reductase. As shown in Fig 5 , 20-fold enhancement of nitrate reductases (LHK_02079-LHK_02085) and more than 10-fold increase of fumarate reductases (LHK_02340-LHK_02342) and dimethyl sulfoxide reductase operons (LHK_02496- LHK_02499) were observed at 37°C compared with 20°C. The upregulation of these terminal reductases at 37°C probably due to the decreased solubility of oxygen at higher temperature. In fact, L . hongkongensis is often found in human intestine where the oxygen level is very low. Therefore, induction of anaerobic respiration-related genes at 37°C possibly support the bacteria to adapt to hypoxia condition during infection for survival. Apart from anaerobic reductase, Class III ribonucleotide reductase NrdD and NrdG (LHK_02258- LHK_02259) were dramatically up-regulated (73 and 91-fold) at 37°C. Since these proteins catalyze the reduction of ribonucleoside triphosphates to deoxyribonucleotides in anaerobic condition, they may also play roles in providing sufficient deoxyribonucleotides for bacteria to maintain a faster DNA synthesis and repair systems at 37°C. On the other hand, the genes involved in iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis were highly expressed at 20°C compared with 37°C ( Fig 5 ). Iron-sulphur clusters are fundamental to numerous biological processes, in particular acting as protein cofactors for respiration, DNA replication and repair, and gene regulation in bacteria [ 47 ]. Genes associated with iron homeostasis could enhance L . hongkongensis to overcome the stress caused by lower temperature.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169998.g005  Fig 5   The relative expression of genes known to be related to oxidoreductase genes were compared at 20°C and 37°C by RNA-seq.  Each rhombus represents for a single gene, is categorized according to its function. The dashed lines represent a 2-fold over-expression at 37°C (upper line) and 20°C (lower line) conditions.       Regulation of temperature-associated virulence and pathogenic factors  To understand the pathogenesis of L . hongkongensis , we also compared the gene expressions of virulence factors between two temperatures ( Fig 6 ) and found that most of the iron acquisition and transportation genes but not iron storage genes were upregulated at freshwater temperature (20°C). For example, the transcription of ferrous iron transporter feoAB (LHK_03044 and LHK_03045), TonB-dependent receptor (LHK_00497, LHK_01193) and transferrin transports homolog fbpAB (LHK_02634-LHK_02636) increased significantly (2 to 40-fold) at 20°C. Iron is vital mineral for bacteria to maintain energy generation and protect bacteria against oxidative stress [ 48 – 50 ]. Since iron is essential in metabolism, hypoferremia greatly restricts the growth of pathogens and thus countermeasures are taken to evade iron-deplete condition in bacteria [ 51 ]. Secreting siderophore is one of the efficient methods to acquire iron from host. Siderophores are small iron chelators with extremely high association constant. Such strong iron binding affinity surpasses host transferrin binding [ 52 ]. Some pathogens utilize receptors to scavenge iron directly from transferrin and lactoferrin to overcome iron limiting defense system [ 53 , 54 ]. In L . hongkongensis , however, no siderophore was found. Instead, homolog of TonB-dependent siderophore receptor (LHK_00497) and ABC transporters for transferrin and lactoferrin are presented, suggesting that iron is acquired through these iron binding proteins [ 18 ]. Together with the over-expression of Fe-S cluster described above, the increase of genes expression involved in iron acquisition suggested that L . hongkongensis obtained iron through multiple pathways to maintain iron homeostasis which in turn, play roles in the pathogenesis of fish infection at freshwater temperature. Noteworthy, iron sequestering systems were often found to be temperature-regulated and overexpressed at temperatures below that of their optimal growth (TBO) in other fish pathogens, which are similar to other virulence factors such as bacteriolysis-related proteins and secretion systems [ 55 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0169998.g006  Fig 6   The relative expressions of genes known to be related to pathogenic factors were compared at 20°C and 37°C by RNA-seq.  Each dot represents a single gene and is categorized according to its function. The dashed lines represent a 2-fold expression at 37°C (upper line) and 20°C (lower line) conditions.       Urease and nickel transport operons were upregulated at human body temperature  Previously, we demonstrated that arginine deiminase pathway was far more important than urease for acid resistance and intracellular survival in L . hongkongensis , which is different from other gastrointestinal tract pathogens [ 56 ]. In our transcriptomic analysis, intriguingly, the mRNA levels of urease and urea transporter (LHK_01035-LHK_01037, LHK_01040- LHK_01044) were enhanced significantly (6 to 12-fold) at 37°C. Moreover, the ABC transporters for nickel including dppA and dppBCDF (LHK_00667, LHK_00939–00942) which provide nickel as cofactor to catalyze urea hydrolysis into ammonia to neutralize the acidic gastrointestinal environment [ 17 ], were also increased more than 5-fold as well ( Fig 6 ). Since the functional consequence of urease pathways is to assimilate urea as nitrogen sources for amino acid production [ 57 ], utilization of urea by increasing expression of urease cassette and the nickel transporting genes could be the potential alternative energy sources for L . hongkongensis to grow at 37°C. Indeed, ureases in Klebsiella and Proteus were shown to induce ammonia and lipopolysaccharide production which could eventually lead to hepatic encephalopathy [ 58 , 59 ], syndrome that often found in liver cirrhosis patients. Since L . hongkongensis was firstly identified in alcoholic liver cirrhosis patients, understanding of the association of ureases pathways to liver dysfunction could lead us to the insight of the pathogenesis of L . hongkongensis .    Branched-chain amino acid transporter was enhanced at freshwater temperature  Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine and valine are essential low-melting-point fatty acid for bacterial survival, in particular gram-positive bacteria [ 60 ]. Interestingly, we noticed that the gene expression of BCAA biosynthesis were similar at both temperatures but those related to BCAA degradation and transportation system were elevated significantly at 20°C ( Fig 7 ). Bacteria normally acquire BCAAs either through BCAA transporters or by intracellular synthesis. In addition, certain bacterial BCAA transporters including Pseudomonas putida [ 61 ] and Shewanella piezotolerans [ 62 ] were found to be temperature regulated. Degradation and biosynthesis of BCAA were proposed to generate precursors for Branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) in the BCFA synthesis model of Shewanella under different external temperatures. The upregulation of BCAA transporters at cooler temperatures was proved to transfer exogenous BCAA into cell for BCFA synthesis. Therefore, promoting BCFA portion could help to maintain the membrane fluidity of bacteria, which is a conventional strategy in cold adaptation [ 63 ]. The induction of BCAA transportation system in L . hongkongensis possibly share similar function of that in Shewanella .   10.1371/journal.pone.0169998.g007  Fig 7   The relative expressions of genes known to be related to amino acid transporters and degradation were compared at 20°C and 37°C by RNA-seq.  Each triangle or cross represents for a single gene. The dashed lines represent a 2-fold over-expression at 37°C (upper line) and 20°C (lower line) conditions.       RND efflux activity was upregulated at 20°C  Previous evidence showed that L . hongkongensis resists to ampicillin, ceftriaxone and erythromycin [ 64 ]. In our result, numerous multidrug resistance (MDR) genes were induced by temperature changes and consequently lead to higher efflux activity, indicating the external stimuli plays roles in drug resistance by regulating the efflux pumps expression. For example, the efflux pumps which are the homologs of mexAB-oprM and acrAB-tolC (LHK_02129-LHK_02131 and LHK_02825-LHK_02827 respectively) were upregulated at 20°C ( Fig 6 ). Moreover, as shown our qRT-PCR result in Fig 8 , two-fold enhancement of these genes with statistically significance were observed at fresh water temperature compared with human body temperature. On the contrary, no difference were found for other MDR genes such as two β-lactamase encoded genes (LHK_00876, LHK_03028) at both temperatures ( S3 Fig ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169998.g008  Fig 8   The graphs showed the mRNA expression of a) LHK_02129–02131 b) LHK_02825–02827 at 20°C and 37°C.  Vertical error bars showed the standard deviations of biological triplicates. Expression level at 20°C was taken as reference for comparison. *P-value<0.05; **P-value<0.01.     Efflux pumps such as MexAB-OprM in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or AcrAB-TolC in E . coli belong to resistance nodulation division (RND) family are responsible for eliminating drugs, dyes and detergent from bacteria [ 65 , 66 ]. They form a complex and highly coupled network with multiple mechanisms to transport substrate including bile acid, fatty acid and antibiotics and make bacteria become MDR [ 19 , 67 ].  Since lower incubation temperature causes membrane solidification, fatty acid composition is altered to provide more short and branched fatty acid [ 68 ]. During this modification, certain metabolites and fatty acid components are in excess. Efflux pumps such as MexCD-OprJ in Pseudomonas aeruginosa are responsible for exporting membrane constituents in the fatty acid turnover process [ 69 , 70 ]. The upregulation of AcrAB-TolC in L . hongkongensis at freshwater temperature possibly responsible for excluding redundant fatty acid components.  Temperature-regulated efflux pumps have been widely discovered in bacteria. For instance, increased efflux activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens ( P . fluorescens ) [ 71 ] and Moraxella catarrhalis [ 72 ] were measured at cooler temperature, suggesting the generosity of temperature-induced efflux pumps expression and activity. In L . hongkongensis , the transcription of efflux pumps elevated at freshwater temperature that may lead to the enhancement of drug resistance because of the increased efflux activity. Bacterial multidrug resistance have been a worldwide health issue in recent years. Investigation on temperature-induced drug resistance in other pathogens should be carried out to constrain this serious health problem.     Conclusion  In this study, we performed transcriptomic analysis of L . hongkongensis at two physiologically relevant temperatures, 20°C and 37°C, mimicking the body temperature of fish and human respectively. Our result indicated the versatile and multi-dimensional adaptive mechanisms of L . hongkongensis in response to different external temperatures. In addition to the shift of metabolic equilibriums and over-expression of stress-related proteins induced by the temperature change, we found that numerous pathways were significantly altered. For example, genes of urease and anaerobic reductases were upregulated at human body temperature whereas, on the contrary, iron transport, branched amino acid transporter and RND efflux pumps were over-expressed at 20°C. In summary, our study demonstrated that the transcriptomic alteration in response to the temperature change and it provides the versatile adaptation to different host, as well as prepare L . hongkongensis for the challenge from the host immunity.

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is substantially heritable, but few molecular genetic risk factors have been identified. Knockout mice lacking SLIT and NTRK-Like Family, Member 5 (SLITRK5) display OCD-like phenotypes including serotonin reuptake inhibitor-sensitive pathologic grooming, and corticostriatal dysfunction. Thus, mutations that impair SLITRK5 function may contribute to the genetic risk for OCD. We re-sequenced the protein-coding sequence of the human SLITRK5 gene ( SLITRK5 ) in three hundred and seventy seven OCD subjects and compared rare non-synonymous mutations (RNMs) in that sample with similar mutations in the 1000 Genomes database. We also performed in silico assessments and in vitro functional synaptogenesis assays on the Slitrk5 mutations identified. We identified four RNM’s among these OCD subjects. There were no significant differences in the prevalence or in silico effects of rare non-synonymous mutations in the OCD sample versus controls. Direct functional testing of recombinant SLITRK5 proteins found that all mutations identified in OCD subjects impaired synaptogenic activity whereas none of the pseudo-matched mutations identified in 1000 Genomes controls had significant effects on SLITRK5 function (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.028). These results demonstrate that rare functional mutations in SLITRK5 contribute to the genetic risk for OCD in human populations. They also highlight the importance of biological characterization of allelic effects in understanding genotype-phenotype relationships as there were no statistical differences in overall prevalence or bioinformatically predicted effects of OCD case versus control mutations. Finally, these results converge with others to highlight the role of aberrant synaptic function in corticostriatal neurons in the pathophysiology of OCD.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003621  Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning    2231-415   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9561-8505  Minseok Song        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725  National Research Foundation of Korea    NRF-2016R1D1A1B03934438   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9561-8505  Minseok Song       Ministry for Health and Welfare, Korea   HI14C1135   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9561-8505  Minseok Song        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002  National Institutes of Health    MH079513   Charles E.

Epidemiologic studies have determined that OCD displays a substantial heritable component of risk, however, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified [ 2 – 4 ]. Recent large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) of OCD have identified common polymorphisms that are associated with OCD at near genome-wide significance levels [ 5 , 6 ]. These studies have demonstrated that the genetic architecture of OCD is very complex likely consisting of hundreds to thousands of common polymorphisms each of small effect size. The small effect sizes of these risk alleles prevents their practical usage as clinical biomarkers but OCD GWAS’s have begun to identify biological processes in which the associated polymorphisms are enriched and thus presumably underlie the pathophysiology of OCD.  Recently it has been appreciated that, in addition to common polymorphisms, rare genetic variation can contribute to the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders in human populations [ 7 ]. RNM’s have been implicated in genetic risk for both autism and schizophrenia through whole exome sequencing [ 8 , 9 ]. In these studies, rare variants are enriched in cases versus controls to a degree suggesting that they have large effects on autism risk relative to common polymorphisms. In OCD, targeted re-sequencing of the human gene for the postsynaptic synapse-associated protein 90 (SAP90)/postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95)-associated protein 3 ( SAPAP3 ), motivated by an OCD-like phenotype in knockout mice lacking SAPAP3, found an overrepresentation of RNM’s in OCD and/or trichotillomania subjects implicating SAPAP3 in the genetic risk for OCD [ 10 ].  We have identified an OCD-like phenotype in mice lacking expression of SLIT and NTRK-Like Family, Member 5 (SLITRK5) [ 11 ]. SLITRK5 knockout mice display a pathologic over-grooming phenotype that is accompanied by disrupted corticostriatal circuit activity. Moreover, pathologic grooming behavior in SLITRK5 knockout mice is normalized by serotonin reuptake inhibitors; the most effective pharmacologic treatments for OCD [ 12 , 13 ].  The SLITRK’s are a family of transmembrane proteins that have two extracellular leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains which facilitate protein-protein interactions [ 14 ]. In particular, postsynaptic SLITRK3 has been shown to facilitate inhibitory synaptogenesis through trans-synaptic interactions with presynaptic protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPδ) [ 15 ]. All of the SLITRK family members bind PTPδ, and a recently reported structural study of PTPδ and SLITRK1 supports the notion that other SLITRK isoforms may also play a role in synapse formation via interaction with PTPδ [ 16 ]. Slitrk5 expression is enriched in striatal neurons suggesting that altered synaptogenesis due to loss of SLITRK5-PTPδ interactions may provide a mechanism for the selective corticostriatal phenotypes seen in the SLITRK5 knockout mouse: decreased striatal volume, decreased dendritic complexity of striatal neurons, reduced expression of glutamate receptor subunits on striatal neurons, and decreased post-synaptic responses of striatal neurons to stimulation by cortical inputs [ 11 ].  Motivated by the phenotypic similarities between SLITRK5 knockout mice and human OCD, we hypothesized that, as with SAPAP3 , RNM’s in the human SLITRK5 gene ( SLITRK5) might contribute to the genetic risk for OCD. We re-sequenced the protein coding sequence of SLITRK5 in human subjects with OCD and compared RNM’s (population prevalence <1%) from that sample with mutations in the 1000 Genomes Database [ 17 ]. Although there were no statistical differences in the distribution or bioinformatically predicted functional effects of SLITRK5 mutations from OCD cases versus controls, direct functional testing determined that all of the SLITRK5 mutations identified in OCD subjects reduced synaptogenesis in vitro while none of the most comparable pseudo-matched control mutations from the 1000 Genomes Database we tested had significant effects. These results implicate SLITRK5 in the population risk for OCD and highlight the role of synaptic function in corticostriatal circuitry in the pathophysiology of OCD.    Methods   Samples for re-sequencing  The re-sequencing sample consisted of three hundred and seventy seven OCD subjects (754 chromosomes). All subjects provided written informed consent after receiving a complete description of the study and met DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD [ 1 ]. Details of subject recruitment and ascertainment have been published in other reports (5, 6, 37–39). The ancestral composition of the re-sequencing sample was mixed with major representation of European American (68%) and Hispanic chromosomes (11%).  For control chromosomes we used data from the initial 1092 subject (2184 chromosomes) 1000 Genomes Project sample of un-phenotyped individuals of diverse ancestry (17).    Re-sequencing  Overlapping amplicons covering the entire protein-coding sequence of human SLITRK5 were amplified for each subject by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequences for PCR primers are available in supplemental material. After removal of excess primers and free nucleotides samples were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Mutations were identified by visual inspection of aligned sequencing results using Sequencher software (Gene Codes). All putative mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the reverse strand from independent PCR reactions.    In silico annotation of SLITRK5 mutations  Bioinformatic assessment of the deleteriousness of mutations in SLITRK5 was performed using Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD; http://cadd.gs.washington.edu ), which combines information from multiple annotations to quantitatively prioritize functional variants (20). Functional annotation was based on Human Genome Assembly build 65 and GRCh37 human reference genome.    Mice  All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Weill Cornell Medical College and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Pregnant mice around E16 (from Charles River) were maintained in a SPF barrier facility under a 11:13-h light:dark cycle (lights on, 0700 to 1800) at temperatures of 21 to 24°C. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages on corncob bedding with ad-libitum access to food (Harlan Global Diet Low Fat Irradiated) and water. Mice were sacrificed by decapitation after being anesthetized by CO2 in accordance with the guidelines of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering, to reduce the number of animals used.    Functional Assays  Detailed methods including reagents are available in supplemental material.   Synaptogenesis assay  Primary hippocampal mouse neurons were co-cultured with HEK-293 cells that had been individually transfected with plasmids containing human influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged versions of wild type SLITRK5, SLITRK5 mutants from OCD cases or 1000 Genome controls, and a negative control form of SLITRK5 lacking the extracellular domain (ΔECD). SLITRK5 expressing transfected cells were identified by immunolabeling with anti-HA antibodies. Synaptogenesis by hippocampal neurons onto SLITRK5 expressing HEK-293 cells was quantified by immunolabeling hippocampal axons using anti-Tau antibodies [ 18 ] and synapses using anti-Synapsin I antibodies [ 19 ]. Synaptogenesis was defined as the total intensity of synapsin I signal in regions positive for both surface HA (labeling transfected SLITRK5-expressing HEK-293 cells) and dephospho-Tau (labeling primary hippocampal axons). Analysis was performed using NIS-Elements (Nikon Instruments Inc., NY, USA), Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 4. Statistical comparisons were made using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, as indicated in the Figure legends. All data are reported as the mean ± s.d. in at least three independent experiments.    Subcellular localization assay  HEK-293 cell cultures were individually transfected with recombinant versions of each mutation introduced into the HA-tagged SLITRK5 peptide. HEK-293 cells were fixed and incubated with anti-HA antibodies without permeabilization to specifically label cell surface expressed recombinant SLITRK5. Surface HA-tagged SLITRK5 was visualized by immunolabeling with Alexa-488 dye-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100-containing PBS, and internally expressed SLITRK5 alleles were stained with anti-HA antibodies. Internally localized HA-SLITRK5 was visualized with Alexa-568 dye-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. Cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy and staining intensities of each fluor in individual cells was quantified using NIS-Elements. Values corresponding to surface SLITRK5 (green) were divided by the total fluorescence values (red+green) and normalized to wild type SLITRK5. All data are reported as the mean ± s.d. in at least three independent experiments.    Soluble PTPδ-Fc protein and binding assays  Based on previously described methods [ 15 ], a soluble PTPδ ectodomain peptide fused to an Fc immunoglobulin domain epitope tag (PTPδ-Fc) was generated by transfecting HEK-293 cells and then purified from culture media. HEK-293 cells on coverslips were transfected with WT or variant HA-tagged SLITRK5-coding plasmids and incubated with the soluble PTPδ-Fc fusion protein (200nM). Cells were then immunolabeled with anti-IgG and anti-HA antibodies. Binding was measured as the average ratio of bound PTPδ-Fc immunofluorescence to HA-SLITRK5 immunofluorescence normalized to wild type SLITRK5. All data are reported as the mean ± s.d. in at least three independent experiments.      Results   Re-sequencing SLITRK5  We identified four rare non-synonymous mutations (RNM’s) in 377 OCD subjects (1,1%), non-significantly lower than the prevalence of similar mutations in 1092 unphenotyped controls from the 1000 Genomes Database where there were fifteen (1.4%), Chi-square 0.21, P = 0.65. Each of the OCD-associated mutations was seen in a single chromosome and seven of the control mutations were singletons. Of the remaining control mutations, eight were seen in a single population and one was seen in two of the four populations included in the 1092 subject 1000 Genomes sample (European, EUR; Americas, AMR; African, AFR; Asian, ASN). One of the rare mutations from the 1000 Genomes Database had a population-specific prevalence greater than 1% in the ASN sample (1.6%) and was excluded from further analyses to avoid possible downward biasing of the effects of control RNM’s.  The prevalence of chromosomes containing RNM’s was also non-significantly lower in OCD cases (0.5%; 4 singletons/754 chromosomes) than controls (1.3%; 28 total mutant chromosomes/2184 total chromosomes) for controls Chi-square 2.88, P = 0.09. These results demonstrate that there is no association of OCD with either the number of SLITRK5 RNM’s or the prevalence of chromosomes containing those mutations.    Comparison of predicted deleterious effects of SLITRK5 mutations  We assessed the predicted effects of RNM’s in silico using CADD which provides a single C score that reflects a prediction of the deleterious functional effects of specific amino acid substitutions. [ 20 ]. There were no significant differences in the raw or scaled C scores between RNM’s found in OCD cases versus 1000 Genomes controls or the subset of pseudo-control mutations used for SLITRK5 functional testing ( Table 1 ). There were no differences in the bioinformatically predicted effects of RNM’s in any of the component annotations including Grantham, SIFT, or Polyphen scores [ 21 – 23 ].   10.1371/journal.pone.0169994.t001  Table 1  In Silico effects of rare non-synonymous Pmutations.

We analyzed all OCD mutations and a subset of pseudo-matched mutations from the 1000 Genomes database sample ( Fig 1A ). Pseudo-matched controls were selected as the mutation nearest to an OCD mutation. For the three amino acid substitution OCD RNM’s there were pseudo-controls in the same functional domain; for the amino acid deletion mutant we could not identify an appropriate pseudo-matched control ( Fig 1A ). All of the OCD mutations and pseudo-matched controls occur in residues that are absolutely conserved from mouse to human and occur in very highly conserved contexts ( Fig 1B ). For two of the three pseudo-matched pairs the chemical categories of both the ancestral and mutant amino acids were also matched, for the third pair, the OCD mutation (N99K) is an acidic polar amino to basic amino acid substitution and the pseudo control (Q118H) is an acidic to basic substitution. Average normalized CADD score for OCD mutations (21.27± 0.9) and pseudo-matched controls (20.33 ± 2.52) were statistically similar (P = 0.75; Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169994.g001  Fig 1   Structure of Slitrk5 and location of rare non-synonymous mutations.

Mutations identified in OCD subjects are labeled in red and pseudo-matched mutations from 1000 Genome Database subjects are labeled in blue. (B) SLITRK5 mutations placed in their primary sequence context. All mutations alter absolutely conserved peptide contexts denoted by asterisks.       Synaptogenesis  The SLITRK’s are postsynaptic trans-membrane proteins that promote synaptogenesis in co-culture systems through interaction of their leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains [ 24 , 25 ]. We therefore performed co-culture assays in which non-synaptogenic HEK-293 cells are transfected with recombinant HA-SLITRK5 which then acts as bait attracting synapse formation by primary hippocampal neurons ( Fig 2B ). Synaptogenesis was measured through immunolabeling and quantifying expression of the synaptic marker, Synapsin I, in Tau-expressing axons overlaying HA-SLITRK5 positive HEK-293 cells ( Fig 2A and 2C ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169994.g002  Fig 2   Synapse formation is altered by OCD-associated SLITRK5 mutations.  (A) Representative images from synapse formation assays for control or OCD mutants of Slitrk5. Axonal processes of primary neurons were immunolabeled for the neuronal marker Tau (green), and HEK-293 cells were transfected with and immunostained for HA-tagged recombinant SLITRK5 proteins (blue). Synapsin I immunostaining (red) only occurs where a synapse is formed and the overlap with Slitrk5 appears yellow. Synapse formation is measured as the ratio of immunoreactivity for the synapse marker Synapsin I to the axonal marker Tau. (B) Synapse formation assay. Primary neurons (green) were co-cultured with HEK-293 cells that were transfected with various alleles of Slitrk5 (blue). Synaptogenesis is measured by expression of the synapse-specific marker Synapsin I (orange). (C) All OCD-associated and no control mutants caused reduced synaptogenesis. Results are normalized to the ancestral wild type (WT) human allele. ΔECD is a deletion mutant negative control SLITRK5 lacking the extracellular domain used as a negative control. (25–30 cells were analyzed per condition per experiment. **: P<0.01, ****: P<0.001 compared to WT).     We found that all SLITRK5 alleles containing mutations identified in OCD subjects significantly impaired synapse formation relative to ancestral SLITRK5 when transfected into HEK-293 cells whereas none of the pseudo-matched controls did ( Fig 2A and 2C ) significantly implicating functional mutations in SLITRK5 in genetic risk for OCD (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.028).    Surface expression and TrkB binding  To refine the mechanism by which the OCD-associated SLITRK5 mutations impaired synaptogenesis, we first tested if mutant HA-SLITRK5 alleles were expressed properly at the cell surface. HEK-293 cells were transfected with OCD or control HA-SLITRK5 alleles and surface expression was assessed by immunolabeling HA-SLITRK5 in intact cells followed by immunolabeling of HA-SLITRK5 in the same cells treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 to permeabilize plasma membranes ( Fig 3A and 3B ). One of the SLITRK5 mutations identified in an OCD case (A851V) displayed significantly reduced surface localization (0.18 ± 0.03; P<0.0001) while all other mutants, including the pseudo-matched control (P891L) were expressed at the cell surface similarly to ancestral HA-SLITRK5 ( Fig 3A and 3B ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169994.g003  Fig 3   OCD-associated mutation A851V prevents surface expression of SLITRK5.

Fraction of surface expression measured as SLITRK5 immunolabeling of intact cells divided by the sum of intact and permeabilized labeling. (20–30 cells were analyzed per condition per experiment. *P<0.05, ****P< 0.0001 compared to WT).     Previously, we have reported that SLITRK5 interacts with and regulates TrkB receptor function. We next considered whether SLITRK5 RNM’s exhibited deficient TrkB binding. To test this hypothesis, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments using HEK-293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged TrkB and HA-tagged SLITRK5 RNM’s. We found that only one OCD-associated mutants (A851V) failed to co-precipitate with TrkB, probably due to altered subcellular localization, whereas the other OCD RNM’s as well as control mutants exhibited intact TrkB binding under resting condition ( S1 Fig ).    Protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPδ) binding  PTPδ is a transmembrane domain protein that binds to members of the SLITRK family. Transsynaptic PTPδ-SLITRK3 interactions have been shown to facilitate formation of inhibitory synapses [ 15 ]. We have recently shown that PTPδ competes with TrkB, the prototypic BDNF receptor, for binding to SLITRK5. In the absence of BDNF, SLITRK5 forms transsynaptic bonds with PTPδ whereas in the presence of BDNF SLITRK5 interacts in cis with TrkB [ 26 ]. We therefore tested if the remaining mutations, which occur in LRR domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, alter synaptogenesis by impairing SLITRK5-PTPδ interactions. We incubated soluble fusion protein comprised of the PTPδ ectodomain and the human immunoglobulin Fc fragment with HEK-293 cells transfected with surface expressed mutant HA-SLITRK5 alleles and immunolabeled the fusion proteins through their Fc- and HA- epitope tags ( Fig 4A and 4B ) [ 15 ]. All of the remaining, surface-expressed, OCD mutations displayed reduced binding of PTPδ-Fc ( Fig 4B ) providing a mechanistic explanation for the reduced synaptogenesis seen in the co-culture studies.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169994.g004  Fig 4   PTPδ-Fc binding is impaired by OCD-associated SLITRK5 mutations.

After transfection of HEK-293 cells with the control and OCD-associated SLITRK5 mutations, their interaction with purified PTPδ-Fc was examined by co-precipitation and immunoblot analyses. These studies demonstrated that the OCD-associated SLITRK5 mutations exhibited reduced interaction with PTPδ-Fc compared to control mutations. Especially, A851V mutant that does not localized to the plasma membrane showed complete loss of PTPδ-Fc binding ( Fig 4C and 4D ).     Discussion  We have re-sequenced SLITRK5 to identify RNM’s in OCD patients. When comparing the prevalence of OCD RNM’s with controls from the 1000 Genomes Project, there were no significant differences either in the number of distinct RNM’s or their prevalence. Bioinformatic analysis did not predict that RNM’s from OCD cases were more deleterious than those from controls. Direct testing of the synaptogenic activity of recombinant SLITRK5 and mutant alleles found that all of the RNM’s from OCD subjects impaired synaptogenesis whereas none of the control RNM’s did. These results demonstrate that functionally deleterious mutations in SLITRK5 are significantly associated with OCD. Our use of controls from the 1000 Genomes Database can be critiqued because participants are not true controls as they are not screened to rule out OCD or other disorders however such a large dataset provides more information on rare mutations than would be possible with screened controls. Moreover, any biasing effects of individuals with OCD in the 1000 Genomes Database sample would tend to include potential OCD-associated functional mutations in our control sample and none of the 1000 Genome RNM’s affected synaptogenesis. Similarly, our functional testing of only a subset of 1000 Genomes RNM’s leaves open the possibility that RNM’s not tested may alter synaptogenesis however our focus on the most similar, closest matched pseudo-control RNM’s was intended to test the RNM’s most likely to affect Slitrk5 function in similar ways to the OCD RNM’s and can therefore be considered conservative. Finally, the ethnic composition of our OCD cases is not identical to the populations represented in the 1000 Genomes Database and differences in the prevalence of rare mutations across populations has been identified as a source of artifactual associations [ 27 ]. The issue is minimized in this study because the basis of our association is not based on a relative over-abundance of RNM’s in cases versus controls rather on the fact that those RNM’s present in OCD subjects biologically affect synaptogenesis and those in controls do not.  These studies emphasize the importance of integrating biological approaches into human behavioral genetic studies. In the case of common polymorphisms, biological characterization of human variants using in vivo model systems can enhance the reliability of genetic association studies of behavioral domains and facilitate exploratory hypothesis generation [ 28 – 30 ]. In this report we have demonstrated that direct biological characterization of RNM’s can be essential in dissociating pathology-related from control variation in instances when the case-control distribution and in silico prediction of functional effects of RNM’s do not identify statistical associations. Moreover, association based on impaired biological function reduces the risk of common confounding factors such as ethnic stratification that can be a particular problem in association analyses of rare population-specific mutations [ 27 ] because causality is inferred based on the effects of pathology-associated mutations as opposed to their simple existence.  Impaired synaptic function in corticostriatal circuitry is an emerging theme in the genetics of OCD [ 31 , 32 ]. Impaired synaptogenesis, either through decreased surface expression or PTPδ binding, is a shared cellular phenotype of the OCD RNM’s we identified ( Fig 5 ). The SAPAP3 knockout mouse was the first model of serotonin reuptake inhibitor-sensitive OCD-like overgrooming phenotype [ 33 ]. SAPAP3, like SLITRK5, is highly enriched at excitatory post-synaptic densities in striatal neurons where it acts as a scaffolding protein [ 33 ]. Also similar to SLITRK5 knockout mice, SAPAP3 knockouts have reduced post-synaptic responses to stimulation of cortical input through altered expression of glutamate receptor subunits [ 34 , 35 ]. Extending the genetic evidence for a role of altered corticostriatal synapse function in OCD, a polymorphism upstream of the human PTPδ gene ( PTPRD ) was the most significantly associated polymorphism in a recent large-scale GWAS of OCD [ 5 ] suggesting that common genetic effects on PTPδ-SLITRK5 interactions could contribute to risk for OCD in addition to the effects of the rare SLITRK5 mutations we have identified here ( Fig 5B ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169994.g005  Fig 5   Genetic risk factors in OCD converge on corticostriatal synapse function.  (A) Schematic of functional effects of OCD versus 1000 Genomes population control RNM’s. All control RNM’s supported synaptogenesis similar to WT Slitrk5 when expressed in HEK-293 cells (blue) while all OCD RNM’s impaired synaptogenesis (red). (B) Schematic of corticostriatal synaptic dysfunction identified in genetic studies of OCD. PTPRD is associated with OCD in GWAS and both SLITRK5 and SAPAP3 cause an OCD-like syndrome in knockout mice and contain rare OCD-associated mutations.

Echolocating bats prey upon small moving insects in the dark using sophisticated sonar techniques. The direction and directivity pattern of the ultrasound broadcast of these bats are important factors that affect their acoustical field of view, allowing us to investigate how the bats control their acoustic attention (pulse direction) for advanced flight maneuvers. The purpose of this study was to understand the behavioral strategies of acoustical sensing of wild Japanese house bats Pipistrellus abramus in three-dimensional (3D) space during consecutive capture flights. The results showed that when the bats successively captured multiple airborne insects in short time intervals (less than 1.5 s), they maintained not only the immediate prey but also the subsequent one simultaneously within the beam widths of the emitted pulses in both horizontal and vertical planes before capturing the immediate one. This suggests that echolocating bats maintain multiple prey within their acoustical field of view by a single sensing using a wide directional beam while approaching the immediate prey, instead of frequently shifting acoustic attention between multiple prey. We also numerically simulated the bats’ flight trajectories when approaching two prey successively to investigate the relationship between the acoustical field of view and the prey direction for effective consecutive captures. This simulation demonstrated that acoustically viewing both the immediate and the subsequent prey simultaneously increases the success rate of capturing both prey, which is considered to be one of the basic axes of efficient route planning for consecutive capture flight. The bat’s wide sonar beam can incidentally cover multiple prey while the bat forages in an area where the prey density is high. Our findings suggest that the bats then keep future targets within their acoustical field of view for effective foraging. In addition, in both the experimental results and the numerical simulations, the acoustic sensing and flights of the bats showed narrower vertical ranges than horizontal ranges. This suggests that the bats control their acoustic sensing according to different schemes in the horizontal and vertical planes according to their surroundings. These findings suggest that echolocating bats coordinate their control of the acoustical field of view and flight for consecutive captures in 3D space during natural foraging.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  Japan Society for the Promotion of Science    JP24686050   Shizuko Hiryu        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  Japan Society for the Promotion of Science    JP16H06542   Shizuko Hiryu        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  Japan Society for the Promotion of Science    No. 27-3861   Miwa Sumiya        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241  Japan Science and Technology Agency     Shizuko Hiryu     This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS, https://www.jsps.go.jp ) KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP24686050 (Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A)), JP16H06542 (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas) to SH, and No. 27-3861 (Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Research Fellow) to MS, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST, http://www.jst.go.jp/ ) PRESTO program to SH.

They emit directional ultrasonic signals and listen to the echoes returning from objects. Perception by the bats firstly depends on the acoustical features of the returning echo, which change depending on various factors, such as distance to target, direction of target, and target strength. Second, the direction and directivity patterns of the beams emitted by these bats are simple but important factors that affect their “field of view” from echolocation (acoustical field of view), and restrict the extent of spatial information during echolocation. The microphone-array technique has been widely used to track the three-dimensional (3D) flight trajectory of bats [ 1 – 4 ] and also allows us to measure the direction and directivity of the bats’ sonar beams during flight in a flight chamber and in the field [ 2 , 4 , 6 – 13 ]. By measuring the pulse direction ( acoustic attention ) and directivity patterns (beam width) as useful indices, we can investigate where the bats direct their attention and potentially detect prey, and how they control their acoustical field of view during advanced flight maneuvers. Recently, it has been reported that echolocating bats actively change the pulse direction depending on the situation in a flight chamber [ 2 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 ] or even in the field [ 4 , 5 ]. They have also been reported to expand the beam width adaptively before capturing target prey to retain a moving target within the acoustical field of view [ 11 , 13 ] or to narrow the beam width when entering a confined space [ 14 ]. These studies demonstrated that bats actively adjust both the pulse direction and the beam width, as well as traditional acoustic characteristics, such as time-frequency structure, sound pressure level, or inter-pulse interval (IPI) [ 15 , 16 ].  In our previous study, we constructed a 32-ch microphone-array covering an area of 22 × 24 m, to measure the 3D flight paths and horizontal pulse directions of the Japanese house bat, Pipistrellus abramus during natural foraging [ 5 ]. Pipistrellus abramus exhibits acrobatic hunting behavior, which involves occasionally capturing multiple airborne insects within a short time interval (less than 1 s) in the field [ 3 , 5 ]. We also reported that the bats directed their pulse toward the subsequent target before capturing the immediate one when attacking two successive targets [ 5 ]. On the other hand, our recent study adopted a mathematical methodology to estimate parameters representing the flight attention of bats for their measured flight paths during the phase of approaching prey [ 17 ]. (Note that the flight attention is derived from a parameter of weighing factors to minimize the angular difference between the bat’s flight direction and the direction to its prey. This represents the attention by the bat toward a certain target prey in terms of flight.) We found that the distribution of the flight attention parameters (estimated from the behavioral data of wild P . abramus during two consecutive captures in a short-time interval) corresponded to the optimal value of the parameter set in the numerical simulation, which showed a high success rate of consecutive prey captures. This indicated that bats plan their future flight paths based on additional information about their next prey. This model was based on the assumption that bats distribute their attention across multiple prey. This implies that bats acoustically recognize the positions of multiple prey at the same time, even while approaching their immediate prey. To confirm this assumption experimentally, we investigated the relationship between the prey direction (direction of prey relative to the pulse direction) and the beam width of the bat during natural foraging in the field. We proposed two hypotheses: 1) bats physically shift their pulse direction between immediate and subsequent targets in somewhat of a time-sharing manner (time-sharing manner hypothesis), or 2) bats aim their beam across a wide area to cover both immediate and subsequent targets simultaneously within their acoustical field of view (acoustical field hypothesis). Based on our previous studies [ 5 , 17 ], we propose an acoustical field hypothesis in which the bats are assumed to aim their pulses in a certain direction. This keeps multiple targets within their acoustical field of view, including the peripheral part. These features may be linked to processes in visual-guided animals; for example, humans sometimes detect objects using the peripheral field of vision [ 18 – 20 ]. Visual-guided animals are also known to shift the gaze direction sequentially to guide movement planning [ 21 ]. Therefore, the investigation of control of the acoustical field of view by bats during flight not only provides insight into how animals actively sample spatial information from their environment during locomotion, but can also be used for comparative studies along with visual research on how animals use their vision during locomotion [ 7 , 8 ].  Echolocating bats seem to use their acoustical field of view effectively during aerial-feeding flights by advanced coordinated control of the acoustical field of view and flight. To investigate how bats control these features in 3D space during consecutive prey-capture flights, we established horizontal and vertical microphone-arrays in the field to measure the flight paths and 3D pulse direction and directivity pattern of the emitted sounds during natural foraging. For every pulse emission, we examined time variation in the pulse direction and beam pattern in relation to the direction of immediate and subsequent targets while attacking multiple target prey consecutively in the field. Furthermore, we conducted a numerical simulation to determine how the bats control the acoustical field of view according to the prey directions for the successful capture of both immediate and subsequent prey.    Materials and Methods   Subjects and study site  The subject of this study was P . abramus , which is a member of the family Vespertilionidae and has a wingspan of 10–15 cm and a bodyweight of 5–8 g. During natural foraging, P . abramus emits relatively long (9–11 ms), shallow-swept frequency-modulated (FM) pulses, with the energy concentrated in the terminal frequency of the fundamental component at around 40 kHz [ 3 , 22 ]. The bats are regularly observed in large open areas during the evening from early summer to fall. Here, the study site was a large open area over a river with the width of approximately 20 m, near the campus of Doshisha University in southern Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, where only P . abramus regularly appears to forage for airborne insects. Our field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. No specific permissions were required for these locations/activities because the study site was not protected by the regulatory body concerned with the protection of wildlife. The target prey of P . abramus are mainly small hemipterans and dipterans [ 23 ]. The flight speed of the common chironomid midge Chironomus plumosus ranges from 0.25 to 1.1 m/s [ 24 ], and we visually observed that swarming dipteran midges took several seconds to fly across an area of a few tens of centimeters. From our observation, we concluded that these prey are roughly ten times slower than P . abramus (which has an average speed of 5 m/s) and therefore assumed that the movement of the prey, at this study site, was negligible during the brief period of approach and capture (< 3 s) in each flight sequence examined in this study [ 17 ].  When a bat successfully captures an insect, a brief burst of sounds (feeding buzz) occurs, followed by a silent interval (post-buzz pause) [ 25 – 27 ]. Based on our previous recording, P . abramus emits a feeding buzz approximately 0.2 s before capture [ 3 , 5 ], at a distance of a few tens of centimeters (approximately 30 cm) from the prey point. Since the movement of prey can be negligible within this brief period of time, we simply defined the bat’s 3D position at the end of the feeding buzz as the location of the prey at the capture in this study [ 3 , 5 , 17 ].  It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about whether a bat has successfully captured prey based only on information about the post-buzz pause [ 17 , 27 ]. However, we confirmed that the distances between successful prey positions were too large for the prey (small midges) to move during the observed inter-capture intervals for the flights analyzed in this study. Therefore, if the bats failed to capture prey, it is highly unlikely that they attacked the same prey again in the second capture trial just after the first unsuccessful capture. Although it is still an assumption, we assumed that the bats attacked different prey sequentially, at least in the case of two successive target captures with short time intervals (< 1.5 s) in this study. We thus categorized two successive target captures with long time intervals (> 3.0 s) as long-interval capture and those with short time intervals (< 1.5 s) as short-interval capture .    Large-scale 3D microphone-array system  The recordings were carried out on 5 separate days (October 14, 2013; July 15, September 30, October 7, and October 16, 2014) for approximately one hour before and after sunset. Recording was conducted for 5–10 min each session and the total number of recording sessions was 32 for 5 days (total recording time: 225 min). To reconstruct the flight paths of the bats and identify the capture points accurately, we selected prey-capture flights where the amplitude of the sonar sounds was sufficiently high with a good signal-to-noise ratio, even at the end of the terminal buzz. At the same time, to ensure measurement accuracy, we selected only flights where the bat approached the targets while flying toward the L-shaped array inside of the U-shaped array. Thus, the vertical and horizontal pulse directions and beam widths could be measured accurately. We analyzed a total of 2,680 pulses from 37 captures in 20 measured flight paths. That is, flight paths with three successive captures were split into two flight paths with two successive captures each. (See Results .)  Echolocation pulses emitted from the bats were recorded using a custom-built 44-ch 3D microphone-array ( Fig 1A ). We previously reconstructed the horizontal pulse direction along with 3D flight paths using a horizontal U-shaped 32-ch microphone-array system [ 5 ]. In this study, we newly built a vertical 12-ch L-shaped microphone-array unit so that the vertical pulse direction could be measured. The data shown here are from measurements using two different configurations with 32 microphones in 2013 (vertical L-shaped 10-ch and horizontal U-shaped 22-ch), and 44 microphones in 2014 (vertical L-shaped 12-ch and horizontal U-shaped 32-ch).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169995.g001  Fig 1   Large-scale 3D microphone-array system.

Four Y-shaped arrays (green dots) are part of the U-shaped array. Total of 24 microphones distributed over the entire U-shaped array at the same horizontal level were used to measure horizontal pulse direction, whereas L-shaped array units (orange dots) measured vertical pulse direction. Y-shaped array was used to reconstruct 3D flight paths of the bats. (B) A schematic diagram of the Y-shaped array unit. (C) Side view of the L-shaped array unit. The vertical pulse direction (blue arrow) was determined from the peak of a Gaussian curve (light blue curve), based on the sound pressure vectors (red arrows) across all 12 microphones. The horizontal pulse direction was also determined by the same procedure using the horizontal U-shaped microphone-array. (D) Definitions of the positional relationship between the bat and the target. The gaze angle φ gaze (or θ gaze ) was the pulse direction (blue arrow) relative to the flight direction (yellow arrow) of the bat. The directions of the capture positions (prey position) φ fp (or θ fp ) and φ pp (or θ pp ) were the prey direction (magenta arrow) relative to the flight direction and the pulse direction of the bat, respectively. Here, φ is the horizontal angle and θ is the vertical angle. (See S1 Table ).     The microphone-array units were arranged to cover the entire foraging area over the stream, as shown in Fig 1A . We reconstructed the 3D flight paths using four Y-shaped array units using omnidirectional electret condenser microphones (models FG-23329-C05 and FG-23629-P16; Knowles, Itasca, IL, USA). The emitted echolocation pulses were recorded and amplified using a custom-built electronic circuit via a 10–250 kHz band-pass filter, and were digitized with 16-bit accuracy at a sampling rate of 500 kHz using high-speed data acquisition cards (PXIe-6358; National Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). The output signals were synchronously stored using a personal computer via a custom program using LabVIEW 2011 (National Instruments).    Reconstruction of 3D flight paths and pulse directions  The 3D locations of the bats were obtained using the difference in arrival times between a central and three other microphones separated by 1.3 ± 0.01 m in the Y-shaped array ( Fig 1B ). The arrival-time differences were calculated from cross-correlation functions using a Matlab routine (Math Works, Natick, MA, USA), and the analytical procedure was the same as in our previous studies [ 3 , 5 , 17 ]. We combined 3D sound coordinates calculated by each of four Y-shaped array units so that the flight trajectory could be reconstructed within the foraging area, which was enclosed by the microphone-arrays. The maximum range error of the microphone-array system was less than 10 cm for sound sources within 5 m of the Y-shaped array unit [ 3 ].  The horizontal pulse direction was calculated based on the sound pressure difference, namely, the differences in peak power in the spectrogram of a sonar sound across 24 microphones that were distributed over the entire array at the same horizontal level. The vertical pulse direction was also measured by the L-shaped array unit by the same method ( Fig 1C ). The sound pressure levels of the pulses were corrected for the propagation loss of sounds in the air between the bat and each microphone and the sensitivity differences between the microphones in the array. Sound absorption was calculated from measured absorption coefficients that were determined for the average frequencies at the peak energy in the FM pulse of P . abramus (1.2 dB/m at 45 kHz). The sensitivity of the microphone-array elements was measured by sending a 10-ms burst at 45 kHz to each microphone of the array using an ultrasonic loudspeaker (PT-R7, Pioneer, Tokyo, Japan). This allowed the recorded sounds to be calibrated according to sensitivity differences between the microphones. The directivity pattern of the sonar beam was reconstructed by curve fitting using a Gaussian function, and the direction at the peak value of the reconstructed directivity pattern was determined as the pulse direction. The beam width was defined by –6 dB off-axis angles in the reconstructed directivity pattern from the pulse direction. In our previous studies, we calibrated the measurement accuracy of the pulse direction and beam width for a U-shaped array. The error of the pulse direction was less than ±5°, and that of the beam width was less than ±7°, in the horizontal plane when the sonar beam was directed toward the U-shaped horizontal microphone-array [ 5 , 17 ]. In the present study, prior to the experiments, we arranged the L-shaped arrays in the field following the actual recording setup to measure the error of the vertical pulse direction and the beam width by using artificial FM sounds emitted from a loudspeaker (PT-R7; Pioneer, Tokyo, Japan). As a result, when the bat’s sonar beam was directed to the inside of the L-shaped array (as shown in Fig 1C ), the errors for both the vertical pulse direction and the beam width were less than ±5°. The amount of error in this study corresponded to that of our previous studies [ 5 , 17 ], which was an acceptable amount of error to investigate the acoustical behavior of bats at the study site. To ensure measurement accuracy, we measured the horizontal beam width only when the vertical pulse direction was within ±45° from the horizontal plane of the U-shaped horizontal microphone-array. Therefore, when the bats emitted a pulse toward the exterior of the microphone-array (i.e., the positive direction in the X -axis in Fig 1A ), we did not use the data for calculating beam width, but rather used only that for pulse direction to ensure the measurement accuracy of the beam width because it was unclear whether the vertical pulse direction was directed within ±45° from the horizontal plane. The vertical pulse direction was reconstructed only when the horizontal pulse direction was toward the inside of the U-shaped microphone-array. The vertical beam width was also calculated only when the horizontal pulses were directed within ±45° from negative direction of X -axis ( Fig 1A ) to ensure measurement accuracy.  In a strict sense, because auditory perception depends on the level of the returning echo and the hearing threshold of the bat [ 28 ], we should consider not only the beam width but also the angular range, combined with the transfer function of the outer ear, to define the acoustical field of view [ 29 , 30 ]. In this study, however, we adopted the −6 dB point of the beam width as a simple index of the acoustical field of view during echolocation following the approach used in recent studies [ 31 , 32 ].  We defined the positional relationship between the bat and the prey position, as shown in Fig 1D . The variables φ and θ represent the horizontal and vertical angles, respectively. The bat’s horizontal (vertical) gaze angle φ gaze ( θ gaze ) was defined as the pulse direction relative to the flight direction. When the bat captured multiple successive targets, we used suffixes to represent the order of the captures. φ fp (or θ fp ) was defined as the direction of the prey position relative to the flight direction of the bat, while φ pp (or θ pp ) indicates the direction of the prey position relative to the pulse direction. (See S1 Table .)    Acoustic analysis  The analytical procedure was also the same as that used in our previous studies [ 3 , 5 ]. The acoustic characteristics, including IPI and pulse duration, were analyzed from echolocation sounds recorded by the central microphone of the Y-shaped array unit that was spatially closest to the sound source (the bat) and thus received the strongest version of each broadcast using an additional custom program in Matlab. IPI was determined as the time between the amplitude envelope peaks of successively emitted echolocation pulses on oscillograms. The pulse duration was determined from a spectrogram of the first harmonic component of an extracted individual pulse (1024 points fast Fourier transform with a Hanning window, 97% overlap) at −25 dB relative to the peak intensity of the pulse. The foraging behavior of the bats was categorized into three phases based on the characteristics of the sonar sound; namely, a search phase, an approach phase, and a terminal phase [ 33 ]. The terminal phase of pipistrelles is usually divided into two signals: buzz I and buzz II [ 26 ]. Buzz II signals have lower bandwidth and frequency than buzz I signals [ 33 ]. Since the start of the approach phase of wild P . abramus was characterized by the appearance of a slight increase in the pulse duration [ 3 , 5 ], we used this as a simple index for identifying the timing of the beginning of the approach phase in this study.  For statistical comparisons, a t –test and Mardia–Watson–Wheeler test were used, when appropriate, to test for significant differences in beam width and angular variables between data sets.    Methods for the numerical simulation  We numerically simulated the flight trajectory of a bat when approaching two prey successively, so that the relationships between the acoustical field of view and the direction of each prey could be investigated quantitatively. In this framework, the bat dynamically changes its flight direction depending on the directions of the two prey, using the mathematical model proposed in our previous study [ 17 ]. Briefly, the modeled flight dynamics in the horizontal and vertical planes can be described as follows:     d φ b ( t ) d t = 1 δ h { α h sin [ φ bp 1 ( t ) − φ b ( t ) ] + β h sin [ φ bp 2 ( t ) − φ b ( t ) ] } ,    (1)       d θ b ( t ) d t = 1 δ v { α v sin [ θ bp 1 ( t ) − θ b ( t ) ] + β v sin [ θ bp 2 ( t ) − θ b ( t ) ] } ,    (2)  where δ represents positive weighting factors and α is the minimization of the angular difference between the bat’s own flight direction [ φ b ( t ), θ b ( t )] and the direction to prey 1 [ φ bp1 ( t ), θ bp1 ( t )] (similar for β to prey 2). To simplify the numerical simulation, we constrain the parameters as follows:     α h 2 + β h 2 = 1 ,    (3)       α v 2 + β v 2 = 1.    (4)   Therefore, parameters α h and β h ( α v and β v ) are described as α h = sin γ h and β h = cos γ h ( α v = sin γ v and β v = cos γ v ). To examine the ratio of the flight attention between the two prey, the arctangent of parameters α and β is defined by γ : namely, γ h and γ v represent the arctangents in the horizontal and vertical planes, respectively.  The flight path was numerically simulated for a situation in which two prey are distributed inside the bat’s 3D sonar beam, which was modeled as a circular piston oscillating in an infinite baffle [ 11 ]. A simulation trial began when the bat started its approach phase to capture prey 1. The calculation conditions for a parameter set ( γ h and γ v ) are the same as those in our previous study [ 17 ], and the beam widths of the sonar beam in the horizontal and vertical planes were defined as ±59° and ±25°, respectively, which were derived from the experimental results of this study. Three trials were performed for each parameter set of γ h and γ v , ranging from −π to π, respectively, with 0.01π steps, and 201 × 201 pairs. All variables in this model were calculated by using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method, with a time step of 0.01 s (the flight speed of the model bat was taken to be 5 m/s based on the experimental data). Pulses to obtain the target positions were emitted at every step. We examined the relationships between the acoustical field of view and the direction of each prey, in cases of both success and failure of the prey-capture trials, using this mathematical model. A parameter set was defined as a success when the bat captured (close in within 10 cm) the immediate prey (prey 1) and then the subsequent prey (prey 2) in sequence (capturing both prey), without losing the location of the prey which the bat intend to capture (i.e., prey 1 before the capture of prey 1 and prey 2 after the capture of prey 1). A simulation trial was defined as a failure when prey 2 was located outside the sonar beam after the capture of prey 1 (capturing only prey 1) (note that cases in which both prey 1 and prey 2 were missed were not considered in the investigation). We categorized the numerical simulation results of all trials into cases of success and failure and then analyzed the relationships between the acoustical field of view and prey directions while approaching prey 1 and prey 2 sequentially. Initial positions of prey 1 and prey 2 were randomly determined in horizontal and vertical space in every trial.     Results   3D flight paths and pulse directions of bats attacking multiple targets in the field  Fig 2A–2C show representative data of the 3D flight paths with pulse directions of P . abramus when the bat captured four insects (Targets 1–4) consecutively in 12 s. The pulse directions did not always coincide with the flight direction, especially in the horizontal plane. The bat changed its flight direction and pulse direction dynamically on either the right or the left side from its flight direction or shifted between different directions. On the other hand, 82% of all pulses whose vertical pulse direction could be measured in this flight case (shown as a blue arrow in Fig 2A–2C ) were emitted downward (< 0°), whereas only 18% of the pulses were emitted upward (≥ 0°). This suggests that the bat emitted most of its pulses downward from the horizontal plane in the vertical plane.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169995.g002  Fig 2   Typical example of multiple consecutive capture flight of Pipistrellus abramus in the field.  (A–C) Top (top panels) and side (bottom panels) views of the 3D flight path and pulse directions of the bat attacking four successive targets. The observed 3D flight path of the bat was separated into three sections according to the timing of each consecutive target capture; namely, Captures 1–2 (A), Captures 2–3 (B), and Captures 3–4 (C). The black curved arrows indicate the initial flight direction of the bat. The blue arrows indicate the directions of pulse emission by the bat. The asterisks show the position where the bat started the approach phase. The gray arrows indicate the pulse emitted toward the out of the U-shaped microphone-array in the horizontal plane. Only pulses emitted before the bat captures its immediate prey are shown in the figure. (D–F) Time series data of IPIs (D), gaze angles ( φ gaze and θ gaze ), and directions of prey positions in the horizontal (E) and vertical planes (F) during this flight. The beam width of the sonar beam is equivalent to the length of gray vertical lines on the gray plots. φ fp (or θ fp ) indicates the direction of the prey position relative to the flight direction of the bat. (See S1 Table .)     Fig 2D shows time series data of IPI during the flight shown in Fig 2A–2C . When the bat started the approach to capture an insect, the IPI was decreased from approximately 100 to 5 ms. In this flight case, the time intervals between successive captures (Captures 2–3 and 3–4) were both 1.1 s, whereas the time interval for the first two successive captures (Captures 1–2) was 5.4 s. Throughout this flight period, the horizontal gaze angle, φ gaze , was widely distributed from approximately −130° to 80° ( Fig 2E ). In contrast, in the vertical plane, the gaze angle θ gaze had a narrower range from about −60° to about 40° ( Fig 2F ), indicating that the bat changed the horizontal acoustical field of view more dynamically than the vertical one during foraging.  Fig 2E and 2F show that φ gaze and θ gaze often corresponded to the directions of some of the subsequent prey positions; that is, not only the prey position of the immediate target but also subsequent target prey positions corresponded to the center of the acoustical field of view. In addition, both the immediate and subsequent prey positions were simultaneously within the −6 dB beam width of the sonar beam (gray vertical lines). In particular, Fig 2E shows that the pulse direction corresponded to the positions of Captures 3 and 4, approximately 4 s before Capture 2 occurred. (See from 1.5 s to 3.5 s on the horizontal axis.)    Future prey positions were covered by acoustical field of view  Fig 3A–3C show time series data of target directions before capture of the immediate target (0.5 s) and we could define the capture points of subsequent targets as the positions of the prey themselves in the case of short-interval capture . Fig 3A shows that in the case of long-interval capture , the subsequent prey ( φ pp2 and θ pp2 ) were outside the acoustical field of view during the approach period of the immediate target. This suggests that the bat acoustically focused only on the immediate prey during long-interval capture . On the other hand, during short-interval capture , the subsequent target prey positions were within the beam width of the bat’s emissions during the whole or part of this period in both horizontal and vertical planes ( Fig 3B and 3C ). These results suggest that the bats can detect the positions of both their immediate prey and subsequent ones at the same time by keeping them within their acoustical field of view before capturing the immediate one during a short-interval capture . Fig 3A also shows that the immediate target directions ( φ pp1 and θ pp1 ) were not always maintained at the center of the acoustical field of view, but were within the bat’s −6 dB beam width, in both horizontal and vertical planes, in the case of long-interval capture .   10.1371/journal.pone.0169995.g003  Fig 3   Relationship between target positions and bat sonar beam while approaching targets.  (A–C) Time series data of φ pp (top panels) and θ pp (bottom panels) during the approach and terminal phases in long- (A) and short-interval captures (B, C) shown in Fig 2A–2C . φ pp (or θ pp ) indicates the direction of the prey position relative to the pulse direction. (See S1 Table .) The light blue areas show the range of the −6 dB beam width of the bat’s sonar beam relative to the bat’s pulse direction. The vertical dashed lines show the timing of transition from the approach phase to the terminal phase.     Fig 4A–4D show the relationship between the target direction and −6 dB beam width during the approach phase and buzz I in terminal phase for all recorded flight data (20 flights). The time of the measured flight paths ranged from 2 to 18 s, with an average of 7.5 s. In the long-interval captures (10 flights), the horizontal and vertical mean −6 dB beam widths of the pulses were ±51 ± 13° ( N = 150 pulses) and ±27 ± 14° ( N = 95 pulses), respectively. On the other hand, in the short-interval captures (10 flights), the horizontal and vertical mean −6 dB beam widths of the pulses were ±59 ± 12° ( N = 131 pulses) and ±25 ± 8° ( N = 85 pulses), respectively. Namely, the horizontal mean beam widths were significantly wider than the vertical ones for both short - (the t –test, t (214) = 25.1, P < 0.001) and long-interval capture cases (the t –test, t (195) = 13.7, P < 0.001). In addition, the short-interval capture case showed a slightly but significantly wider horizontal beam width than the long-interval capture case (the t –test, t (279) = 5.2, P < 0.001), whereas the vertical ones were not significantly different between short - and long - interval capture cases (the t –test, t (153) = 1.06, P = 0.146).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169995.g004  Fig 4   Relationship between the prey direction relative to pulse direction and the directivity patterns of the sonar beam as bats converge on immediate prey in short- and long-interval captures .  Circular histograms show the directions of the immediate (horizontal, φ ppi ; vertical, θ ppi ) and subsequent (horizontal, φ pps ; vertical, θ pps ) prey relative to the bat’s pulse direction. Data were obtained from the recording sounds while the bat converged immediate prey (except for buzz II) for 10 flights each of (A, C) long- and (B, D) short-interval captures . The open light-blue circles indicate the amplitude measured at each microphone, showing the directivity patterns of the sonar beam. We defined 0 dB as the peak value of the curve-fitted directivity pattern of each sound. The vertical (A, B) and horizontal (C, D) axes for the circular histogram show the proportion relative to each number of pulses. Note that the sample sizes in the circular histogram differ from those in the directivity patterns. This is because the beam width data were analyzed only for pulses whose horizontal and vertical pulse directions could be appropriately measured at the same time. (See Materials and Methods ).     Fig 4A–4D also show the directions of the immediate and subsequent prey relative to the bat’s pulse direction accompanying beam patterns while approaching the immediate prey. We found that in the cases of long-interval captures , only 30% (59/196 pulses) of pulses covered the subsequent prey within the mean beam width (i.e., ±51 ± 13°), whereas the immediate prey was covered by 98% (193/196 pulses) of pulses in the horizontal plane ( Fig 4A ). On the other hand, most of the pulses emitted while approaching the immediate prey in the case of short-interval captures (90%, 167/186 pulses) covered the directions of both immediate and subsequent prey within the mean beam width in the horizontal plane (i.e., ±59 ± 12°) ( Fig 4B ). In the vertical plane, the immediate and subsequent prey directions, θ ppi and θ pps , were covered within the vertical mean beam width (i.e., ±27 ± 14°) by 94% (164/175 pulses) and 93% (162/175 pulses) of pulses, respectively for long-interval captures ( Fig 4C ). In the case of short-interval captures ( Fig 4D ), 81% (140/172 pulses) of pulses in the subsequent prey direction, θ pcs , were observed within the vertical mean beam width (i.e., ±25° ± 8°). The horizontal mean directions of the subsequent prey φ pps in the cases of long- and short-interval captures were −106° ( long-interval captures ) and 9° ( short-interval captures ), respectively, which were significantly different (the Mardia–Watson–Wheeler test, B (2) = 165.1, P < 0.001). In addition, those in the vertical plane were also significantly different (the Mardia–Watson–Wheeler test, B (2) = 32.1, P < 0.001), whereas those were 8° and 7°, respectively. This shows that the bats maintained the subsequent prey within their 3D acoustical field of view in the short-interval captures ; this supports the acoustical field hypothesis.  Simultaneous coverage of both immediate and subsequent prey within the acoustical field of view is supposed to be suitable for planning of the bats’ future path to ensure capture of both prey. To test this, we conducted a numerical simulation ( Fig 5 ). The numbers of simulation trials of failure and success were and 4,841 (229,706 pulses) and 1,665 (68,466 pulses), respectively. In the case of failure (only prey 1 was captured), only 39% (89,323/229,706 pulses from 4,841 trials) of pulses covered the subsequent prey within the beam width in the horizontal plane ( Fig 5A , φ pps ). On the other hand, in the success cases, 62% (42,418/68,466 pulses from 1,665 trials) of pulses covered the subsequent prey (prey 2) within the beam width before the capture of the immediate prey (prey 1) in the horizontal plane ( Fig 5B , φ pps ). This also suggests that the bat could potentially succeed in capturing both prey without invariably keeping the subsequent prey within the beam width in the horizontal plane; that is, the bat could occasionally lose the location of prey 2 just after the start of the simulation trial but could find it while changing the flight direction to capture the prey 1 because the pulse direction was equal to flight direction in the numerical simulation. In the vertical plane, 66% (151,655/229,706 pulses) of pulses in the failure cases and 87% (59,253/68,466 pulses) of pulses in the success cases covered both prey 1 and prey 2 ( Fig 5C and 5D ). These results suggest that acoustically viewing both the immediate and the subsequent prey simultaneously increases the success rate for the bats to capture both prey.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169995.g005  Fig 5   Numerical simulation of relationship between prey direction relative to pulse direction and directivity patterns of sonar beam as bats converge on immediate prey during failure and success cases.  Circular histograms show the directions of the immediate (horizontal, φ ppi ; vertical, θ ppi ) and subsequent (horizontal, φ pps ; vertical, θ pps ) prey relative to the bat’s pulse direction calculated based on the simulation results. A simulation starts when the bats start to converge on immediate prey, and pulses to obtain the target positions were emitted at every step. A parameter set was defined as a success when the bat captured (close in within 10 cm) the immediate prey (prey 1) and then the subsequent prey (prey 2) in sequence (capturing both prey), without losing the location of the prey which the bat intend to capture. The simulation was assumed for the phase in which the bat converge immediate prey. Data were taken from 4,841 trials of failure (A, C) and 1,665 trials of success cases (B, D). The light blue lines show the directivity patterns of the sonar beam used in the numerical simulation.        Discussion   Relationship between acoustic sensing and bat flight  In this study, we found that, in the case of short-interval capture , the bats simultaneously maintained both their immediate and subsequent prey within the horizontal and vertical beam width of the emitted pulse. In addition, the numerical simulations in this study demonstrated that keeping both targets within the beam width increased the success rate of consecutive prey captures. This is considered to be a basic axis of efficient route planning for consecutive-capture flights. These findings suggest that the bats control their pulse direction to cover multiple targets simultaneously within their acoustical field of view. This supports the acoustical field hypothesis derived from our previous studies [ 5 , 17 ].  One of our previous studies showed that, in the case of capturing multiple prey within a short time interval, the sonar beam of P . abramus during foraging shifted directions predictably between the current target and the next target [ 5 ]. Based on the measurement results for the 3D beam width in the present study, we found that the bats actually encompassed both prey in their acoustical field of view. This suggested that when attacking two successive targets, the bats can focus their acoustic attention on a subsequent target before capturing the immediate one. This observed acoustic behavior can account for the flight dynamics for the flight attention of bats. That is, the bat distributes its flight attention between the immediate and subsequent prey so that it can plan its future flight path for a high success rate of consecutive prey captures [ 17 ].  Interestingly, our experimental data show that the bats did not always maintain their immediate prey at the center of the beam width (e.g., Fig 3A and 3B ). Instead, they kept the targets within the beam width including the peripheral part, using their wide directional beam effectively to distribute their acoustic attention among multiple targets. Such practical operation of wide directional beam scanning employed by the bats is different from the design concepts of existing sensing methods, namely, ultrasonography and radar, which employ high-speed spatial scanning of a narrow directional beam to maintain the spatial resolution of echoes.  Because the movement speed of the prey was insignificant when compared to that of the bats during aerial-feeding flights, at least for a brief period (< 3 s), we set the capture point as the target position during the approach and terminal phases. (See Materials and Methods .) On the other hand, we often see the target prey of P . abramus (i.e., mainly small hemipterans and dipterans) [ 23 ] swarming at the same position for several tens of seconds, implying that P . abramus in our study site may use information on patch locations of insect swarming for consecutive captures. For example, Fig 2E shows that the pulse direction corresponded to the positions of Captures 3 and 4, approximately 4 s before Capture 2 occurred. (See from 1.5 s to 3.5 s, in the horizontal axis.) It is still difficult to conclude, however, that the coincidence of the pulse direction with the future prey positions implies that the bat might obtain information on the subsequent prey in advance beyond our expectations. There is another possibility: other prey might be incidentally covered by the acoustic beam before the bat captures its immediate prey during flight. That is, the bat’s sonar beam could incidentally cover multiple prey while it forages in an area where the prey density is high. Therefore, at the beginning of approaching the consecutive prey, this would be less of a strategy than a coincidence with respect to keeping multiple prey within the bat’s acoustical field of view.  Our previous numerical simulation, however, revealed that a bat’s active utilization of positional information on subsequent prey is effective for planning future flight paths during short-interval captures [ 17 ]. Furthermore, the modeling results in the present study support the idea that maintaining multiple targets within one sonar beam is an effective strategy for consecutive capture. Based on all of these findings, we suggest that the bat’s wide sonar beam incidentally covers multiple prey, and then the bat keeps future targets within its acoustical field of view by actively controlling its acoustical field of view for effective foraging. Mathematical modeling allows us to analyze animal behavior quantitatively, while also suggesting new insights and implementations of cause and effect [e.g., 34 , 35 ]. Further experimental and mathematical investigations into how capable bats are at prediction, and the utilization of the gathered information, will be helpful to clarify the collaborative control of the acoustical field of view and flight path planning employed by bats, in the context of effective adaptation of foraging behavior.    Acoustic sensing in the horizontal and vertical planes  The experimental results demonstrated that the scanning behavior of P . abramus differed in the horizontal and vertical planes. We found that the vertical scanning range and the sonar beams were narrower than the horizontal ones in both long- and short-interval capture flights. (See Fig 4A–4D .) The bat changed the horizontal acoustical field of view more dynamically than the vertical one, sampling spatial information preferentially in the horizontal plane. In addition, the vertical flight range of the bats (variation of flight height) was also narrower by over five times than the horizontal one. (See Fig 2A–2C .) Namely, the bats modify their flight attention on the horizontal plane for prey that are incidentally on the same vertical plane. Prey insects are usually limited to a certain height above the water. The bats at our study site must avoid bumping into the riverbank during their acrobatic flight maneuvers. Hence, the physical restrictions of the study site may dictate that bats mostly scan their environment horizontally.  On the other hand, the experimental results show that the acoustical coverage rate of subsequent prey in the vertical plane (93% of pulses, Fig 4C ) was higher than that in the horizontal plane in the case of long-interval capture (30%, Fig 4A ), which is consistent with the numerical simulations of failure cases (capturing only prey 1) ( Fig 5A vs. 5C ). Experimental and mathematical results suggest that the bats tend to search for target prey distributed within a certain altitude range, which results to narrow down the vertical scanning and flight ranges. Foraging P . abramus often emits pulses downward (see Results ) and attacks insect prey in descending flights [ 3 ]. Simplifying sensing and flight control in the vertical plane may be effective for complex aerial-feeding flight in 3D space.     Supporting Information   S1 Table   Definitions of angular variables.

In 2008 the U.S. Department of Energy set a target of 20% wind energy by 2030. To date, induction-based turbines form the mainstay of this effort, but turbines are noisy, perceived as unattractive, a potential hazard to bats and birds, and their height hampers deployment in residential settings. Several groups have proposed that artificial plants containing piezoelectric elements may harvest wind energy sufficient to contribute to a carbon-neutral energy economy. Here we measured energy conversion by cottonwood-inspired piezoelectric leaves, and by a “vertical flapping stalk”—the most efficient piezo-leaf previously reported. We emulated cottonwood for its unusually ordered, periodic flutter, properties conducive to piezo excitation. Integrated over 0°–90° (azimuthal) of incident airflow, cottonwood mimics outperformed the vertical flapping stalk, but they produced << daW per conceptualized tree. In contrast, a modest-sized cottonwood tree may dissipate ~ 80 W via leaf motion alone. A major limitation of piezo-transduction is charge generation, which scales with capacitance (area). We thus tested a rudimentary, cattail-inspired leaf with stacked elements wired in parallel. Power increased systematically with capacitance as expected, but extrapolation to acre-sized assemblages predicts << daW. Although our results suggest that present piezoelectric materials will not harvest mid-range power from botanic mimics of convenient size, recent developments in electrostriction and triboelectric systems may offer more fertile ground to further explore this concept.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001  National Science Foundation    1013963   http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0144-3570  Michael A.

In these schemes electromechanical coupling is achieved by piezoelectric elements assembled into the faux plant. If modest-sized piezoelectric plants could generate tens of watts (daW) off-grid, charging appliance batteries, they might supplement energy from residential turbines and commercial wind farms, helping to achieve the goal of “20% Wind Energy by 2030” [ 7 ]. Here we characterize a novel cottonwood-based piezo-leaf, and we predict size constraints on daW-scale harvesting by synthetic plants.  The rationale underlying fabrication of wind-harvesting plants is multifold. Visual and acoustic impacts of wind turbine farms are widely-shared concerns [ 1 ], and artificial plants may be less of a hazard to bats and birds than are wind turbines [ 8 ]. In the United States, geographic hotspots of average wind speed and population density are widely separated, and given limitations of the grid, local off-grid harvesting for reduced-scale application suggests a niche for piezo-plants. In previous efforts, Oh et al. (2009) built a miniature wind energy-harvesting tree of ten plastic leaves bearing polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) inserts that generated 47 mV peak voltage [ 3 ], and Zhang et al. (2014) fashioned a “leaf generator” from PZT nanofibers that produced 820 mV peak voltage in wind of 17 m/s [ 4 ]. Li et al (2011) developed a far more effective piezo-leaf with a “vertical flapping stalk” that generated ~ 100 to 300 μW in modest wind [ 5 ], and “for practical application” suggested assembly of devices with “hundreds or thousands of the Piezo-Leaves, like ivy, tree and forest.” Solar Botanic plans to tap both wind and solar energy from groves of “Energy Trees” sprouting their patented “Nanoleaf” [ 2 ]. The VTT Technical Research Center in Finland took this concept a step further by 3d printing of solar energy-harvesting leaves “capable of harvesting kinetic energy from a surrounding environment such as wind” [ 6 ].  The patent motion of leaves and branches in wind dissipates wind energy. Given a suitable transduction scheme, mimicry of plant anatomies could yield visually appealing architectures for mid-scale wind energy harvesting. Wind energy that is partitioned among leaves, branches, bole and roots of a tree induces motion at sub-Hz to a few Hz (Results), and in a 10 mph breeze a cottonwood tree with 500,000 leaves may dissipate 80 W via leaf motion alone (Appendix A in S1 File ). If a faux tree scavenged half this power, it could deliver off-grid energy sufficient to charge batteries of small household appliances. Tree leaves in the genus Populus flutter in wind speeds at or below the ~ 7 mph threshold of conventional turbines [ 9 ], suggesting deployment of faux trees in populous settings where tall, noisy turbines are viewed a nuisance. Cell phone towers camouflaged as trees already have been used for decades in some urban settings, and their functionality would be amplified if piezoelectric leaf assemblages prove capable of harvesting significant wind energy. The topic of large-scale vibration energy harvesting, per se, is treated elsewhere [ 10 ].  To adapt piezo transducers to plant structures it is necessary to consider frequencies, stress levels, and stochastic movement vis a vis modes that effectively excite piezoelectric generators. Piezoelectric elements act as capacitors that self-charge under stress, and capacitive coupling introduces serious challenges to energy harvesting schemes, including impedance mismatch of source and load, dissipation of low frequency signals by RC filtration, and parasitic capacitance. Unique properties of particular materials, e.g., PVDF, electroactive paper, and PZT also set boundary conditions on empirical models.  Here we analyze power conversion by bioinspired plant designs at different frequencies and load resistance, in controlled and natural wind. Our Kynar-based cottonwood mimics improved upon performance of the “vertical flapping stalk” [ 5 ], but scaled to the size of a cottonwood tree, power was << daW. Cattail-inspired models with stacked elements showed progressive rise in power with capacitance, but remained << daW per acre. Although our results discourage focus on piezoelectric schemes, alternative methods like the triboelectric system pioneered by Wang’s group [ 11 ] may offer a more productive test of wind energy harvesting by botanic mimics.    Results and Discussion   Motional frequency and stress  Excitation frequency is a crucial determinant of power output by piezoelectric elements, due to small energy yields per cycle (Figure B in S1 File ). Thus it is useful to know the frequency range of plant motions in wind. For quaking aspen ( Populus tremuloides ) the dominant flutter frequency of leaves is ~ 3–5 Hz in wind of 2–4 m/s [ 9 , 12 ]. Alfalfa stems exhibit an oscillatory decay (~ 1.3 Hz) to neutral position after an initial mechanical displacement [ 13 ]. Bending frequencies of alfalfa plants in turbulent wind of 1.1 to 6.9 m/s have been inferred from the power spectra of sun flecks striking under the canopy [ 14 ]. A prominent peak occurs at 1–2 Hz in wind speeds of 1.2–6.9 m/s, and at 6.9 m/s the major spectral peak spanned ~ 0.8 to 3 Hz, with some contribution from frequencies up to 10 Hz. Wind stress applied to tree trunks of various species, and the induced trunk excursions, have been measured with strain gauges and high-speed cameras [ 15 ]. The power spectral density of trunk sway in Eucalyptus teretecornus (red gum) in wind of 17 m/s shows a prominent peak at ~ 0.4 Hz, reflecting a dominant motion at this frequency, and Douglas fir has a strong peak at ~ 0.65 Hz [ 16 ]. Upon vigorous agitation by mechanical shakers used at harvest, olive tree frames exhibit normal modes at 20.2 and 37.7 Hz [ 17 ]. Short of gale force winds, trunk movements at these frequencies are unlikely to dissipate much wind energy (but see [ 18 ]). Thus, wind-driven motion of aboveground plant structures appears concentrated in a band from sub-Hz to a few Hz.  The central role of frequency narrows a search for piezo location to small features like leaves (but see Appendix A in S1 File and S1 Mov ). As well, non-chaotic is a more effective stimulus than is random motion. We modeled cottonwood leaves because their vertically flattened petioles compel blades to flutter side-to-side, concentrating energy into one oscillation mode. A laminated PVDF strip measuring 6.15 x 1.22 cm serving as petiole was attached to a faux leaf blade made of double thickness lamination plastic. In fan-generated wind of steady velocity this construct mimicked the side-to-side oscillations of live cottonwood leaves ( S2 Mov ) and had similar threshold wind speed (≤ 3 knots). Fig 1A shows power generated as a function of wind speed, and Fig 1B shows primary data from the rising phase of response. Both frequency and peak voltage increased with wind speed. Flutter frequency measured from slow motion video was ~ half the electrical frequency, as expected with full-wave rectification. Leaf motion became chaotic at ~ 23 knots and nearly ceased at ~28 knots. In the initial, rising phase, power was concentrated in a narrow band that shifted to higher frequencies with wind speed, as indicated in Fig 1C and by the triangles in Fig 1A , reaching ~ 4.5 Hz at 16.1 knots.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170022.g001  Fig 1    Properties of model cottonwood leaf in fan-generated wind: (A) Power dissipated across 10 MΩ load (circles), and frequency of major band (triangles) as function of wind speed; (B) Raw voltage data at two wind speeds; (C) Power spectra at four wind speeds, showing shift of major band to higher frequencies with increase in wind speed. Leaf was angled 60 degrees downward from horizontal.     Fig 2 shows power produced by the same PVDF strip, sans leaf blade, excited by pulses of nitrogen gas at 34 PSI. Pulsatile air excitation allows more precise control of frequency than does steady airflow. For this piezo, power continued to increase with frequency to at least 20 Hz. It jumped disproportionately at 4 Hz, possibly due to mechanical resonance. Greater power output by the complete leaf model likely derives from a larger proof mass (leaf blade), and a bending moment demonstrably less for the partial system. For all frequencies there was an optimal load resistance, also observed in the experiment below.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170022.g002  Fig 2   Effect of excitation frequency and load resistance on power output from PVDF strip exposed to repetitive pulses of N 2 gas at 34 PSI.  Optimal R L corresponds to capacitive reactance of piezo. Sweet spot appears to exist at ~ 4 Hz, perhaps due to mechanical resonance.     Fig 3 shows measurements made on a triplex stack of 15.6 x 1.88 cm PVDF strips that was suspended from its base and flexed periodically by pulses of nitrogen gas at ~ 23 PSI. Power rose to a maximum near 4 Hz and decayed sharply above this frequency (not shown). In bending a piezoelectric cantilever, strain (and voltage) is proportional to displacement perpendicular to the film’s #1 axis length (Appendix D in S1 File ). At frequencies ≤ few Hz, oak or cottonwood leaf-sized PVDF cantilevers bend and relax a few cm in response to repetitive bursts of gas at ~ 23 PSI. At higher frequencies the response was too sluggish to allow cm-scale displacement and relaxation, though stress from each air burst was greater than the pressure difference (~ 3–30 Pa) across the device due to modest wind (2.2–6.7 m/s).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170022.g003  Fig 3    Effect of load resistance on energy conversion by a triplex stack of PVDF elements excited by repetitive pulses of N 2 gas at 4 Hz: (A) Primary data show progressive drop in voltage with R L . (B) Measured (circles) and theoretical (crosses) RMS voltage drops across load resistance; (C) Effect of R L on power (V 2 /R L ), with optimal harvesting near 1 MΩ.       Impedance matching  Impedance mismatch of source and load is a huge barrier to wind energy harvesting by piezo-plants. Piezoelectric elements have high output impedance dominated by capacitive reactance, Xc, (Xc = [2π . F . C] -1 ), where Xc << ohmic resistance of PVDF [volume resistivity 10 14 –10 15 ohm-cm]. At a frequency (F) = 4 Hz, Xc of a single 28 μm thick PVDF element considered earlier is ~ 4 MΩ (C = 10 nF). Fig 3A shows rectified voltage transients in a triple stack of 15.6 cm x 1.88 cm PVDF strips suspended from their base and excited by repetitive bursts of N 2 gas (34 PSI) applied to their tip. Note the decrease when R L was reduced from 1 GΩ to 10 kΩ. The load resistance in series with impedance of the piezo forms a voltage divider, and the fraction of source voltage realized across load is R L /(R L + Xc). Maximal voltage is observed at R L >> Xc. Fig 3B shows reasonable agreement between measured and theoretical RMS voltage over a broad range of R L . Voltage was maximized beyond ~ 100 MΩ. In principle, the optimal efficiency of power transfer to load occurs for R L = Xc. Fig 3C shows that with a PVDF piezo approximately the size of a cottonwood leaf, optimal efficiency of energy transfer to load occurred in the MΩ range, near Xc. A rechargeable Li + ion or NiMH battery has internal resistance < 1 Ω, so for direct charging, transfer efficiency < 2.5 x 10 −5 %.  Harvesting efficiency can be increased by impedance matching through several methods, including buck boost converters and synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI) or capacitor (SSHC) [ 19 ]. Synchronized switch harvesting is effective for periodic signals like those induced by engine vibration, and the stereotyped flutter of Populus leaves might be amenable to SSH. But at 20% efficiency—a liberal estimate, maximum power is several orders too small to support production of daW by devices the size of a large tree.    Charge production  Charge production is a major intrinsic constraint on mechanical-to-electrical conversion by piezo devices. Peak currents can be amplified by increasing the electrode-coated area of a piezo, or by parallel wiring of a stack of mechanically synced elements. However, the benefit of increased area can be offset by parasitic capacitance (Appendix B in S1 File ), likewise, stacking reduces compliance. To test if a useful compromise can be met in faux plants we modeled cattails (e.g., Typha latifolia ) which move somewhat like cantilever beams, more uniformly along their length than does a deciduous oak leaf. Fig 4 shows power produced by a stack of 10 PVDF elements attached to the base of a simplified model comprised of a plastic ruler 19” long and flexed at 1.3 Hz by a gated airstream at 11 knots. Capacitance was increased step-wise by parallel connection of successively greater numbers of elements out of ten in the stack. At R L = 1 MΩ, power increased with capacitance, especially obvious at C ≥ 70 nF, where motional frequency (1.3 Hz) was close to the corner frequency of the RC filter (Appendix C in S1 File ). At C = 100 nF, the model leaf produced 9 μW at 1.3 Hz, a higher frequency than living cattails normally experience (direct observation). At ~ 500 Typha latifolia plants per acre and an average of 5.5 leaves per plant ( S1 Image ), power conversion scaled to 0.025 W/acre.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170022.g004  Fig 4   Power generation by a stack of 10 PVDF elements attached to base of 48 cm cattail-inspired model, flexed at 1.3 Hz by a gated air stream (11 knots).  Individual elements connected in parallel to increase C step-wise. Approximate ten-fold increase in power with ten-fold increase in C. For R L = 1 MΩ, Fc = 16.7, 2.3 and 1.7 Hz at 1, 7 and 10 elements connected in parallel.     In separate experiments, freshly-harvested cattail leaves were fitted with PVDF strips, and currents recorded across a 10 Ω shunt resistor (Methods). Leaves were bent by airflow from a reciprocating fan (~1 Hz) pushing air at 10 knots, and by manual displacements (~ 2 Hz). Duplex and triplex stacks of 15.6 x 1.9 cm elements were attached directly within the leaf axil or 21.5 cm above it. Figure C in S1 File shows that at neither location nor frequency did stacks generate > 4 μA, although measured across a 1 MΩ load, power was greater for 30.8 than 20 nF (not shown). Interestingly, the duplex attached 21.5 cm above the leaf axil generated RMS current similar to the double stack located in the leaf axil, with components at higher frequencies than for the axil.  To consider the potential performance enhancement of increasing transducer size, envision stacks of 10 PVDF elements described above (15.6 cm x 1.88 cm; C = 10 nF each) but now expanded 25-fold lengthwise and 4-fold in width. The polarization axes are aligned, elements wired in parallel and the stacks are aligned with the long axis of a tree trunk. If each cycle of trunk sway stresses stacks similar to a 10 knot wind driving the 15.6 cm x 1.88 cm element at 4 Hz, a naïve assumption, then at a trunk frequency of 0.5 Hz each stack could generate 1 mW. To generate 80 W would require 80,000 transducers, ignoring inevitable power loss from impedance mismatch or parasitic capacitance. The increased piezo area would lower capacitive reactance to 32 kΩ, still 10 3 fold greater than internal resistances of batteries (below). The corner frequency of the high pass RC filter in series with a 1 Ω load resistance (5–10 batteries) is ~ 16 kHz, a few thousand times faster than plants move in wind. It might require a Giant Sequoia to accommodate 8 x 10 4 such transducers, certainly not a convenient backyard plant.    Tree size projected from capacitor energetics  Piezoelectric transducers behave as capacitors that self-charge under stress. Energy stored across a capacitor is E = ½ CV 2 , with C the capacitance and V the voltage. A 28 μm-thick PVDF sensor 15.6 x 1.88 cm with Ag electrodes (and unilateral 127 μm Mylar backing) has C ~ 10 nF. When subjected to stress similar to that of 10-knot breeze it readily produces open circuit voltage ~ 20 V. At 20 V, energy stored per cycle is ~ 2 μJ, and at a frequency of 4 Hz (natural flutter), max power is ≤ 8 μW. For simplicity this ignores frequency-dependent filtering, and overestimates power. How many such capacitors (leaves) would it take to generate 80 W to 1 kW in a 10 knot wind? Assuming 100% transfer to load and all leaves constantly fluttering—naïve assumptions, 10 M to 125 M synthetic leaves would be required. Apart from cost, the environmental impact would be non-negligible and the spatial footprint in excess of a residential turbine generating equal power. At 10 knots wind power density is ~ 6 W/sq. ft. If leaves sweep an area 5 times greater than their own, efficiency is ~10 −4 %.    Material constraints  As noted above, the utility of small piezo devices for wind energy harvesting is handicapped by small charge per cycle. The piezoelectric charge coefficient d 3n for PZT is 5-fold larger than that of PVDF (1.1 x 10 −10 vs. 0.23 x 10 −10 Coulomb/Newton) [ 20 ]. This potential advantage is offset by a 21-fold lower voltage coefficient (g 31 ), 4.2-fold higher density, and 10–20 fold lower compliance than that of PVDF. It would be futile to construct synthetic leaves 4 times heavier and 10 to 20-fold stiffer than real leaves. Macrofiber composites (MFC) of PZT are less dense and more compliant than is conventional PZT, and in our cattail-inspired model a single MFC (C = 185 nF) produced as much power as did the PVDF stack (98 nF) under the same conditions (Figure D in S1 File ). However, stacking of MFC is infeasible beyond ~ 2 or 3 elements, as MFC are less compliant than biological leaves or petioles (see, e.g., [ 21 ], [ 22 ]). The elastic modulus of oak leaves and water lily petioles is 20–50 MPa, whereas Young’s moduli of PZT MFC are > 15 GPa [ 23 ], 10-fold larger than elastic moduli of sunflower petioles [ 24 ].  No flexible materials of which we are aware, including cellulose-based EAPap (max d 3n 0.07 x 10 −10 C/N) [ 25 ], has d 3n values orders greater than that of PVDF or PZT. In one crystal orientation the perovskite Pb(Zn 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 –PbTiO 3 has a maximal piezoelectric charge coefficient (d 33 ) of 2500 pC/N [ 26 ], ~ 20- and ~ 100-fold greater, respectively, than those of PZT and PVDF. A 100-fold boost is inadequate to validate piezo-plant schemes. The protein prestin, a piezoelectric actuator of sound amplification in the cochlea, has a maximum sensitivity of 20 μC/N, 10 4 greater than that of the perovskites [ 27 ]. Were a prestin construct expressed in bionic plants, in accessible anatomic sites, it would be a formidable challenge to couple membrane potential changes to charging of batteries.    Electromechanical coupling factor  The conversion of mechanical to electrical energy by a piezo has a maximum efficiency characterized by k 2 , where k is an electromechanical coupling factor. The magnitude of k varies with excitation mode and material, but for PVDF excited in bending mode, k 31 = 12%, i.e., PVDF has a theoretical limit of 1.4% for converting mechanical to electrical energy. In theory, induction-based turbines are capable of ~ 70%, and in practice they average 20–30%. PZT and BaTiO 3 ceramics have k 31 values ~ 30% and ~ 21%, respectively, corresponding to 9% and 4% conversion efficiencies [ 20 ]. This theoretical advantage over PVDF is counterbalanced by other material properties noted above.    Summation over leaf population, outdoors  On a living tree in wind, a sizeable portion of leaves can sit in a wind shadow created by dense foliage on the upwind side. Also, in a stiff breeze many fully-exposed leaves can remain pushed to an extreme, immobile position for long periods ( S1 Mov ). We asked how power sums over single leaves in our piezoelectric cottonwood model. A primitive piezoelectric tree was fashioned from ten faux cottonwood leaves mounted on a trellis ( Fig 5 ), and power was measured outdoors in natural wind ( S4 Mov ). Whole-tree power at 10 knots was ~ 10-fold greater than for one synthetic cottonwood leaf indoors at 10 knots ( Fig 6 vs. Fig 1 ). Here, average wind speed was estimated as the mean of highest and lowest speed during the 25 s recording. For this small trellis with well-spaced leaves, its plane perpendicular to wind direction, summation was as predicted for parallel wiring of rectified outputs. As the complexity of the faux tree goes up, and leaves are attached at a density and symmetry more typical of living trees (3d vs 2d), an optimal power is realized with less than 100% of leaves contributing.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170022.g005  Fig 5   Cottonwood-shaped plastic leaves mounted on aluminum trellis.  Output from each Kynar-based petiole was rectified before summation over leaf population.      10.1371/journal.pone.0170022.g006  Fig 6   Power output by faux cottonwood trellis as function of wind speed.  (A) Average wind speed estimated from mean of highest and lowest speed during the 25 s recording period. At ten knots, power was ~ ten-fold that of single cottonwood mimic indoors. (B) Power spectrum of single leaf during 500 s, in wind fluctuating from 7.5 to 9 knots. (C) Primary voltage data show variation due to fluctuating wind speed and direction.       Airflow in wind tunnels vs. outdoors  Previous contributions tested piezoelectric leaves indoors in wind tunnels (3–5, 28). Optimization of a system using laminar wind of constant velocity does not yield a system optimized to function in natural wind. In nature, wind gusts, changes direction, and is rendered turbulent by neighboring leaves and branches within the plant. Fig 6B is a power spectrum of a single cottonwood leaf on the faux tree, in actual wind. It showed a similar flutter frequency to natural cottonwood leaves despite its larger-than-life petiole ( S4 Mov ). The outsized petiole may help explain why flutter was more sensitive to changes in wind direction than are leaves of authentic cottonwood trees. Our cottonwood model outperformed the vertical flapping stalk ( Fig 7 ) in this regard, but was not as versatile as living cottonwoods; i.e., viable leaves manifest flutter over a broader range of angles of incidence. The nature of leaf attachment to, and mobility of, supporting branches is a crucial determinant of leaf motion in natural wind.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170022.g007  Fig 7   Directional sensitivity of power output from vertical flapping stalk and cottonwood leaf models.  Power was maximal for both systems when PVDF petiole was oriented edge-on into wind (8.9 vs. 7.5 knots for flapper vs. cottonwood) and decayed with increase in azimuthal angle. Max power was greater but decayed more steeply for vertical flapping stalk. R L = 10 MΩ both systems.       Selected previous work  Priya’s group constructed tiny windmills coupled to piezoelectric bimorphs that produced 5 mW across a 20 kΩ load in a 10 mph airstream [ 28 ]. Windmills convert airflow to periodic motion effective for piezo-based harvesting. To harvest ≥ daW by mimicking often chaotic and low frequency motions of plants is a more complex challenge. A decade ago Rick Dickson inspired discussion of wind energy harvesting by piezo-plants (Dickson, R.M., personal communication). Unfortunately, his approach of “…utilizing large arrays with piezoelectric cells connected in series…” was inherently flawed. Series or parallel multiplexing of piezo elements is possible when elements are excited in-phase, but connecting large arrays of independent elements in series yields zero net voltage.  The British company Solar Botanic patented a “Nanoleaf” that captures sunlight and ostensibly, wind energy [ 2 ]. A scaling issue suggests the futility of wind energy harvesting by Nanoleaves: Their “millions and millions of pW,” nowhere actually measured and published, equates with μW per leaf. Allowing an average of 10 μW per leaf and 500,000 leaves—a substantial tree, power from wind energy would be ≤ 5 W.  In an ingenious construct Li et al (2011) fashioned a piezo-leaf that produced “high” power at low frequency [ 5 ]. Their vertical flapping stalk is a PVDF petiole hanging vertically and attached to a triangular plastic blade, the planes of piezo and leaf blade parallel to each other and perpendicular to ground. Under ideal conditions, i.e., with the PVDF strip oriented perfectly edge-on into wind, downstream of a bluff body, it produced more power (100–200 μW across 10 MΩ) than our cottonwood mimic. We modeled their system from available information, and sans bluff body it produced 15–100 μW at wind speed of 8–18 knots ( Fig 7 and S3 Mov ). Video records showed high amplitude flexion and torsion, which likely explain high power but also distressing noise (65–80 dB at 10 knots).  We asked how output under ideal conditions compared to that at different azimuthal and altitudinal angles, as present in wind gusts outdoors. The faux cottonwood showed striking dependence on altitudinal angle. In 8 knot wind it generated 0.2, 22, 8.5 and 9.9 μW at angles of 0, -30, -60 and -90° from horizontal. Although not addressed by Li et al., we found that the flapping stalk stopped flapping for any but a small range of azimuthal angles nearly parallel to wind direction ( Fig 7 ). Integration over 90 degrees gave 273 vs. 221 μW-degree for cottonwood vs. vertical flapper. Although the flapper beat the cottonwood in max power, the cottonwood capitalized on changes in wind direction better than did the flapping stalk.  A bluff body boosted power from the flapping stalk 10-fold under idealized wind tunnel conditions [ 5 ]. Bluff bodies also were used in wind energy harvesting by a simpler system yielding sub-μW power [ 29 ]. Clearly, a static bluff body placed upstream is of no value when wind shifts direction, blowing from leaf towards bluff body. Fig 6C shows output from a trellised cottonwood, outdoors in natural wind ( S4 Mov ). During 25 s, as wind changed direction and speed, power ranged from 0.15 to 165 μW. We conclude that modest changes in wind direction, and turbulence caused by nearby leaves and branches, compromise performance of e-Trees in ways not considered in previous work. Further, to employ the vertical flapping stalk or other piezo-leaves in real-world settings would require large collections of leaves. Yet to assemble >10,000 flapping stalks or cottonwood mimics, each leaf occasionally producing 100 μW on a windy day, would yield ≤ 1 W. By comparison, a solar panel having much smaller footprint can average 200 W on a sunny day. An alternate mechanism of energy transduction, or electroactive materials of orders greater energy density than present ferroelectrics, may place the piezo-plant idea on firmer ground.    Conclusions  Our findings indicate that generation of ≥ daW from piezoelectric botanic mimics of practicable size is not a near-term reality. Transduction schemes of greater energy density such as triboelectric conversion [ 11 ] or perhaps electrostriction of flexible polymers [ 30 ] may be worthy of testing in synthetic plants. Although valid concerns attend displacement of living with artificial plants, to demonstrate mid-range power for off-grid use in a modest-sized plant mimic would provide strong impetus for real world testing and possible development of such devices.     Materials and Methods  Several types of PVDF sensors were donated by or purchased from Measurement Specialties, Inc. (Hampton, VA). Macrofiber composites of PZT (d31-MFC) were purchased from Smart Material Corporation (Sarasota, FL). Resistors, capacitors, diode bridge rectifiers, op amps and other electronic components were from Newark (Gaffney, SC) or Digi-Key (Thief River Falls, MN). Capacitance was measured with a BK Precision 890B capacitance sorter. Airspeed was measured with a hand-held anemometer (BK Precision #731A).  In some experiments ( Fig 3 ) voltage measurements were made with a USB digital scope and stimulator (Stingray DS1M12) from EasySYNC Ltd. (Hillsboro, OR). Digitized data from the Stingray interface were exported from EasySYNC into Excel. In most experiments a Tektronix digital storage scope (TDS 2002C) was used with Open Choice Desktop, and data exported to Excel. IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) was used to analyze and plot all data.  Piezo output was rectified with diode bridge rectifiers (Multicomp AM154 and Multicomp W01), the signal passed through variable load resistance, and RMS voltage across R L (Figure A in S1 File ) measured over periods of 25 s to 9 m. Power was estimated as [Vrms] 2 /R L . In living cattail experiments, currents were measured from the voltage drop across a 10 ohm precision resistor, using an LTC 1050 op amp with feedback resistance such that gain = 10 4 . A capacitor of similar capacitance to the piezo was used in a few trials to smooth the signal. For a cattail mimic, ten DT4 elements (MSI part # 1-10022149-0) were attached back-to-back with their electrical axes aligned and electrodes wired in parallel with 3M™ EMI Shielding Tape #1183. Each piezo was addressable individually. 3M VHB adhesive transfer tape (F9460 PC) was used to bond elements to each other and to a 12 inch plastic ruler (Wescott B-70) extended to 19” with beavertail sail. DT4 elements are ~ 40 μm thick (PVDF = 28 μm) and VHB tape ~ 50.8 μm. Cattails are not perfect cantilevers, as they often are twisted ≥ one revolution lengthwise, and their cross sectional shape and area vary lengthwise, the distal ~ ¼ of leaf more flexible and strained by wind than the proximal 1/3. However, to capitalize on this tip geometry is difficult because piezo stacks here limit strain. The number density of cattail plants in a local stand ( S1 Image ) was measured by counting individuals in two 100 sq. ft. domains.  A rotary fan at constant speed and wind direction and for higher speeds a heavy duty dust collection system (Penn State Industries, model DC-3XL) were used to induce flutter of cottonwood mimics. In some experiments a pneumatic PicoPump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) was used to deliver repetitive bursts of nitrogen gas at 23 or 34 PSI to the tips of elements anchored at their base. Gating frequency was controlled by TTL output from the USB scope. Artificial cottonwood leaf blades were fashioned from double-layered lamination plastic or 160 μm Tyvek TM on a laser cutter programmed with authentic cottonwood leaf template. Of several materials tested, Tyvek and lamination plastic allowed the most consistent side-to-side motion of the PVDF petiole at low wind speeds ( S2 Mov ), mimicking the flutter of natural cottonwood leaves. The petiole was constructed from a laminated PVDF element (MSI #LDT2-028K/L). An earlier version with larger blades (13 x 14 cm), and a 15.6 x 1.88 cm piezo-petiole produced much less power than the smaller device.  A synthetic cottonwood tree was made from an aluminum trellis and plastic leaves anchored to the branches with duct tape ( S4 Mov and Fig 5 ). Leaves were aligned at 0° (azimuthal) to wind direction, and ~ 45° down from horizontal. Rectified output from each leaf was connected to a parallel bus and voltage measured across 10 MΩ load.

Purpose  Cancer outcomes differ depending on where treatment is received. We assessed differences in outcomes in long-term breast cancer survivors at a specialty care hospital by location of their initial treatment.    Methods  We retrospectively examined a cohort of women diagnosed with invasive early-stage breast cancer who did not experience recurrence for at least 5 years after the date of diagnosis and were evaluated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 1997 and August 2008. The location of initial treatment was categorized as MD Anderson (MDA-treated) or other (OTH-treated). Outcomes analyzed included recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), and overall survival (OS). The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to compare outcomes between the two groups. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).    Results  We identified 5,091 breast cancer survivors (median follow-up 8.6 years), of whom 89.1% were MDA-treated. The 10-year OS, RFS, and DRFS rates were 90.9%, 88.4%, and 89.0% in the MDA-treated group and 74.3%, 49.8%, and 52.7% in the OTH-treated group, respectively. We observed worse outcomes in the OTH-group in both the univariate analysis and the multivariable analysis (OS: HR = 4.8, 95% CI = 3.9–6.0; RFS: HR = 5.8, 95% CI = 4.8–7.0; DRFS: HR = 5.4, 95% CI = 4.5–6.6).    Conclusion  Long-term breast cancer survivors who initiated their treatment at MD Anderson had better outcomes. Location of initial treatment could be an independent risk factor for survival outcomes at specialty care hospitals. This analysis has limitations inherent to retrospective observational studies such as other unmeasured variables may be associated with worse prognosis.

Multiple studies have shown that high-volume hospitals, high physician volume, and specialization are associated with better cancer outcomes [ 4 , 5 ]. A recent study reported that, across all cancer types, the 1-year mortality rate in specialty care hospitals was 10% lower than in community hospitals, and this pattern remained consistent for up to 5 years [ 6 ]. However, specialty care hospitals commonly treat a heterogeneous group of patients where some patients may receive their initial treatment within these specialty care hospitals and others may initiate their treatment in community hospitals and eventually establish follow-up care in the specialty care hospital. This heterogeneity of location of initial treatment could potentially lead to substantial differences in outcomes within a specialty care hospital.  Breast cancer (BC) survivors are still at risk of disease recurrence and death 5 years after diagnosis [ 7 ]. Therefore, in the current study, we sought to determine whether the location of receipt of the initial treatment affected late (>5 years) cancer outcomes among BC survivors who had presented to a single specialty care hospital and had not experienced recurrence for at least 5 years after diagnosis. Specifically, we assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), and overall survival (OS).    Methods   Study population and hypothesis  This retrospective cohort consisted of women diagnosed with invasive early-stage (I-III) BC who had presented to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 1997 and August 2008 and had not experienced any recurrence for at least 5 years after the date of diagnosis. This cohort was identified from the Breast Cancer Management System database housed in the Department of Breast Medical Oncology at MD Anderson, which contains records for all BC patients who have presented to MD Anderson since January 1, 1997. For the purpose of this study, the BC survivors were categorized into one of two groups, based on the location where initial treatment was received: 1) those who had received their initial treatment—chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation—at MD Anderson (MDA-treated) or 2) those who had received their initial treatment at a facility other than MD Anderson (OTH-treated) but had presented to MD Anderson at some point in their care for any reason, including but not limited to second opinions or transfer of care to MD Anderson. We hypothesized that survival outcomes would differ between these two groups of BC survivors. Keeping in mind that the inclusion of survivors presenting to MD Anderson 5 years or more after the initial BC diagnosis could introduce bias by design if a substantial number of them presented with disease recurrence, we also conducted a separate analysis excluding such survivors.    Measurements of exposure, confounders, and outcomes  A BC survivor was considered MDA-treated if 1) she had been diagnosed with invasive BC within 180 days before her initial consultation visit to MD Anderson with one of the BC subspecialists (in medical oncology, radiation oncology, or surgical oncology), and 2) she had received initial treatment for BC at MD Anderson. This specific categorization has been used previously by others [ 8 ]. BC survivors who did not meet at least one of these criteria were categorized as OTH-treated. Standardized Definitions for Efficacy Endpoints in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trials criteria were used to define the outcomes of interest [ 9 ]. RFS was measured from the date of diagnosis of the primary cancer to the date of the first invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, local or regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence, or death from any cause. DRFS was measured from the date of diagnosis of primary cancer to the date of first distant recurrence or death from any cause. Patients were censored at the last day of follow-up.  We collected demographic factors such as age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race/ ethnicity (self-reported), and menopausal status at diagnosis. We classified the tumors as hormone receptor-positive if the tumor was estrogen receptor (ER)- or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive and hormone receptor-negative if the tumor was both ER- and PR-negative, as determined by immunohistochemistry staining using institutional laboratory thresholds. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status was determined by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization. We grouped the tumors into one of three categories: 1) hormone receptor-positive (ER- or PR-positive and HER2-negative or unknown), 2) triple-negative (ER- and PR-negative and HER2-negative or unknown), or 3) HER2-positive (independent of ER or PR status). Tumor stage was determined using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 5th edition staging method for patients diagnosed before 2003 and the AJCC 6th edition for patients diagnosed in 2003 or later. Tumor grade and histologic findings were extracted from biopsy and surgical pathology reports. We captured treatments received, such as chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, and endocrine therapy, by reviewing the patient’s medical record. We determined the most recent vital status of each patient using data from the Tumor Registry at MD Anderson and from medical records. We received institutional review board approval to conduct this study (PA13-0424).    Statistical analyses  Demographic characteristics were summarized and compared using chi-square analysis or the t test, as appropriate. We used the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method to estimate the survival functions. The survival function provides the probability of observing a survival time greater than or equal to a specified time. Without imposing any parametric assumption, Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival function is obtained by multiplying a sequence of conditional survival probabilities with information from both uncensored and censored observations. We used log-rank statistic to test the equality of survival functions by group. The log-rank test compares the observed and expected number of events across all failure time points. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effect sizes of covariates on the hazard of failure, where the hazard function measures the instantaneous rate of an event to occur, given the individual has survived till that time point. We used univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate the crude associations between the main exposure of interest (i.e., MDA-treated or OTH-treated) and potential confounding variables and the outcomes of interest. Variables that showed significant association in the univariate log-rank test were considered potential confounders and were entered in the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. A backward selection process was used and significant variables were retained in the final model. We used a complete case analysis to handle missing values. All statistical tests were performed with a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina), and STATA software, version 12 (Statacorp, College Station, Texas).     Results  We identified 5,091 female long-term BC survivors with a median follow-up period of 8.6 years, of whom 4,534 (89.1%) were MDA-treated (median follow-up period 8.6 years) and 557 (10.9%) were OTH-treated (median follow-up period 8.9 years). In the OTH-treated group, 131 (23.5%) did not receive their initial treatment for BC at MD Anderson despite having a consultation visit at the institution within 180 days after diagnosis, likely representing those who presented for a second opinion; 195 (35.0%) had a consultation visit at MD Anderson at 180 or more days after diagnosis, but did receive some treatment at MD Anderson; and 231 (41.5%) neither received their initial treatment at MD Anderson nor visited MD Anderson within 180 days after diagnosis.  The demographic and clinical characteristics at diagnosis for the overall cohort and by group are presented in Table 1 . Briefly, the mean age at diagnosis for the total cohort was 53.3 years, and most were white (73.2%), around half were diagnosed with stage I disease (52.4%), most had hormone receptor-positive tumors (72.5%), and most had received chemotherapy (66.2%), endocrine therapy (72.9%), or radiation therapy (66.7%). Compared with the MDA-treated group, those in the OTH-treated group were younger at diagnosis, and less likely to be white, and less likely to be postmenopausal. They had more advanced disease, had more triple-negative tumors, were less likely to have received endocrine therapy, were more likely to have received chemotherapy, and were more likely to have received radiation therapy compared with the MDA-treated group.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170081.t001  Table 1  Demographic and clinical characteristics of breast cancer survivors who received their initial treatment at our institution (MDA-treated) or elsewhere (OTH-treated).

We observed a statistically significant difference in vital status between the two groups; 29.3% of the OTH-treated group (median follow-up period 8.6 years), compared with only 7.6% of the MDA-treated group (median follow-up period 9.0 years), had died at the time of our analysis (p < 0.01). We also observed a higher rate of death as the first event in the OTH-treated group (10.2%) than in the MDA-treated group (5.3%).

These results indicate that the MDA-treated population had a higher chance of survival and freedom from recurrences than did the OTH-treated population.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170081.g001  Fig 1   Kaplan-Meier curves for (A) recurrence-free survival (RFS), (B) distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), and (C) overall survival (OS) for breast cancer survivors who received their initial treatment at our institution (MDA-treated) or elsewhere (OTH-treated).     Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed a significantly increased risk of death (OS: hazard ratio (HR) = 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7–4.0) and recurrence (RFS: HR = 5.6, 95% CI = 4.8–6.6; DRFS: HR = 5.0, 95% CI = 4.2–5.9) in the OTH-treated group compared with the MDA-treated group. When adjusted for selected confounding variables in the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model (age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race, stage, surgery type, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy, as well as grade for the recurrence analyses), these risks remained for the OTH-treated population (OS: HR = 4.8, 95% CI = 3.9–6.0; RFS: HR = 5.8, 95% CI = 4.8–7.0; DRFS: HR = 5.4, 95% CI = 4.5–6.6). In the sensitivity analysis, in which patients who presented at MD Anderson 5 years or more after their initial BC diagnosis were excluded, the differences in outcomes between the groups remained statistically significant in the multivariable analysis (OS: HR = 3.6, 95% CI = 2.8–4.8; RFS: HR = 3.1, 95% CI = 2.4–4.0; DRFS: HR = 3.0, 95% CI = 2.3–3.9).    Discussion  In this cohort of long-term (>5 years) BC survivors, we observed significant differences in demographic, clinical, pathologic, and treatment characteristics, as well as in RFS, DRFS, and OS outcomes, between the MDA-treated group and the OTH-treated group. These findings suggest that within a specialty care hospital, those initially treated outside of the specialty care hospital may have different characteristics and are likely to have poorer outcomes than those initially treated within the hospital, suggesting that location of initial treatment could be an independent risk factor for survival and recurrence.  BC survivors in the OTH-treated group had worse baseline disease prognostic factors and poorer event-free survival outcomes. Age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, tumor stage, and receptor status are well-established prognostic factors in BC [ 10 , 11 ] and we found that the OTH-treated group of BC survivors had more of these risk factors than the MDA-treated group. Interestingly, although both groups remained disease-free until at least 5 years from their date of diagnosis, the OTH-treated cohort had several less favorable prognostic markers at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year benchmark in BC survivorship is crucial, because at this point in time, the care of long-term survivors is usually transferred to survivorship clinics or to a primary care physician.  The OTH-treated group was heterogeneous, consisting of some survivors who presented to MD Anderson at least 180 days after their initial BC diagnosis and others who presented to MD Anderson within 180 days but did not receive their initial treatment at MD Anderson. In fact, around 50% of the OTH-treated group presented to MD Anderson more than 1 year, 38% presented more than 2 years, and 31% presented more than 5 years after their initial BC diagnosis. Some BC survivors from this group could have presented to MD Anderson for a second opinion, and others may have relocated to Houston and eventually became part of the Breast Cancer Survivorship Clinic for their follow-up visits although they started and completed their treatment somewhere else.  The consistently worse outcomes in the OTH-treated group could potentially arise from several factors, such as transferring care to MD Anderson because of poor disease prognosis. For instance, the proportion of stage III disease was higher in the OTH-treated group than in the MDA-treated group (16.9% compared with 8.7%). We speculate that some of the survivors in the OTH-treated group who presented to MD Anderson more than 180 days after diagnosis could have had a delay in the initiation of their treatment. However, we do not have enough information to confirm this. Treatment delay is known to be associated with poor survival outcomes in BC [ 12 ]. Also, delay in treatment for BC is more common in patients with low socioeconomic status [ 13 ], which could also have influenced the outcomes in the OTH-group. It has been reported that patients of low socioeconomic status are more likely to receive treatments in low volume, non-teaching hospitals, and they are also likely to have less access to health care benefits and suffer worse outcomes [ 14 , 15 ]. We did not have information on socioeconomic status for our cohort and it is unknown if the OTH-treated group may have more patients with lower socioeconomic status. Given that race has been associated with socioeconomic status [ 16 ], the higher proportion of non-white survivors in the OTH-treated group could be an indication of this.  We were interested in the proportion of survivors who had presented to MD Anderson 5 years after their initial BC diagnosis because this group of individuals either presented to MD Anderson to establish follow-up care or sought treatment at MD Anderson owing to late (>5 years) disease recurrence. However, inclusion of survivors in the OTH-treated group who presented to MD Anderson with disease recurrence would bias the estimates of event-free survivals. Hence, we performed a sensitivity analysis after removing individuals who presented to MD Anderson more than 5 years after diagnosis, and this analysis still showed significantly worse outcomes in the OTH-treated group compared with the MDA-treated group. We noticed that patients in the OTH-treated group had a longer follow-up period, but there were only four patients in the OTH-treated group who had longer follow-up periods than the maximum follow-up period of the MDA-treated group. The differences in the outcomes between the groups were likely not altered by these few observations.  Heterogeneity in patient characteristics and outcomes within large single-center academic hospitals owing to referred patients has been reported before. Kokmen et al [ 17 ] compared the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with Alzheimer disease at Mayo Clinic using resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. The authors grouped the patients into three categories: residents of Rochester, Minnesota; patients referred to Mayo Clinic from the remainder of Minnesota and the four surrounding states; and patients referred from the remainder of the United States. They found significant differences in important patient characteristics between the groups. The authors noted that such differences in patients within an institution can limit the extrapolation of results obtained from epidemiologic studies using data from multiple institutions.  In another investigation, Riggs et al [ 18 ] investigated the reasons for substantially high in-hospital crude mortality rates due to acute stroke in a rural academic medical center. They found that the increased in-hospital mortality rate was mostly attributable to the hospital transfer patients, i.e., patients who were admitted or evaluated in another acute care setting and transferred to the hospital of interest. In a study of multiple sclerosis from a university-based referral center, significant differences were observed in epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of referred patients, who tended to be younger and to more often report worsening of disease than those in a population-based group, indicating that a university setting may not be an appropriate one for collecting generalizable natural history data for that disease [ 19 ]. Our study findings are consistent with those of these two previous studies in that patients who transferred their care to MD Anderson fared worse than patients who initiated care at MD Anderson.  The current study has some limitations, including those inherent to retrospective observational studies. For example, other unmeasured factors could be associated with worse prognosis in the OTH-treated group. In addition, the composition of patients who present to MD Anderson for treatment may not be the same as that of the other specialty care hospitals; therefore, the results of this study may not be generalizable to other specialty care hospitals. In our study, there was an imbalance in the sample sizes between the two groups. However, the findings remained consistent across all analyses despite this imbalance.  In summary, our results indicate that the survival outcomes of MDA-treated long-term BC survivors are better than those of OTH-treated patients. These differences in outcomes among patients within a single specialty care hospital are likely due to multiple factors, and further investigation is needed to establish the underlying causes.

Chronic hepatitis C has been associated with metabolic syndrome that includes insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and obesity. These metabolic aberrations are risk factors for disease severity and treatment outcome in infected patients. Experimental infection of marmosets with GBV-B serves as a tangible, small animal model for human HCV infection, and while virology and pathology are well described, a full investigation of clinical disease and the metabolic milieu is lacking. In this study six marmosets were infected intravenously with GBV-B and changes in hematologic, serum biochemical and plasma metabolic measures were investigated over the duration of infection. Infected animals exhibited signs of lymphocytopenia, but platelet and RBC counts were generally stable or even increased. Although most animals showed a transient decline in blood glucose, infection resulted in several fold increases in plasma insulin, glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). All infected animals experienced transient weight loss within the first 28 days of infection, but also became hypertriglyceridemic and had up to 10-fold increases in adipocytokines such as resistin and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). In liver, moderate to severe cytoplasmic changes associated with steatotic changes was observed microscopically at 168 days post infection. Collectively, these results suggest that GBV-B infection is accompanied by hematologic, biochemical and metabolic abnormalities that could lead to obesity, diabetes, thrombosis and atherosclerosis , even after virus has been cleared. Our findings mirror those found in HCV patients, suggesting that metabolic syndrome could be conserved among hepaciviruses, and both mechanistic and interventional studies for treating HCV-induced metabolic complications could be evaluated in this animal model.

About 2.8% of the world’s population is infected with HCV with associated mortality approximating 500,000 deaths per year [ 2 – 4 ]. In addition to liver disease-related mortality, HCV-infected patients are prone to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [ 5 , 6 ]. A myriad of metabolic aberrations including elevated triglycerides, elevated fasting glucose and abdominal obesity can exacerbate the development of metabolic syndrome, which in turn leads to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 7 ]. Numerous studies have reported the association of HCV and its role in insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, atherosclerosis and other metabolic aberrations that have been specifically described as HCV-associated dysmetabolic syndrome (HCADS) [ 8 – 10 ]. These metabolic aberrations especially steatosis, have been identified as predictors of poor treatment outcome for interferon-based therapy in chronic HCV infection in the early 2000s [ 11 – 14 ]. In the current era of directly acting antivirals, the impact of metabolic disorders on treatment outcome has not been well studied. A better understanding of the dysmetabolic milieu in HCV-infected patients will be helpful in attaining improved sustained virological response rates followed by successful HCV eradication.  HCV also has a direct role in inducing metabolic dysfunctions. HCV core protein interferes with insulin signaling pathways, thus inducing insulin resistance in the infected patients [ 15 , 16 ]. The expression of HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) in human hepatoma cells lead to upregulated gluconeogenic and lipoegenic gene expression, which in turn favors the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome [ 16 ]. In infected hepatocytes, internalized HCV disrupts the host lipid metabolism for its own replication and assembly, leading to hepatic steatosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [ 9 ]. Several pathways have been reported to describe HCV mediated lipid dysregulation in a genotypic specific manner. These include hepatic fat accumulation by activation of SREBP-1 and 2, impairment of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor expression, inhibition of MTP activity and promotion of de-novo lipid synthesis [ 17 – 19 ].  Insulin resistance predates steatosis development, which in turn aggravates steatosis leading to a inflammatory liver microenvironment. This results in activation of cell stress pathways, formation of inflammasome and further hepatocellular injury. Along with liver and pancreas, adipose tissue, acting as an endocrine organ also regulates lipid and glucose metabolism. Dysfunctional adipose tissue is associated with imbalanced production of pro-inflammatory adipokines including adiponectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), visfatin and others, all contributing to local and systemic metabolic dysregulation [ 20 – 24 ]. A state of chronic, low-level inflammation is associated with the metabolic syndrome, either underlying or exacerbating it, predisposing chronic patients to the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma and cardiovascular complications such as atherosclerosis [ 25 – 28 ].  Animal models play an important role in understanding the pathogenesis and immunology of infectious agents, and chimpanzees were formally the primary model for HCV and played a critical role in elucidating the natural history of the disease [ 29 – 31 ]. However, limitations due to ethical and cost reasons have led to a generalized reduction in use of chimpanzees in biomedical research. Marmosets are a promising surrogate nonhuman primate model for HCV due to their high degree of homology with humans immunologically [ 32 ]. Most importantly, GB virus-B (GBV-B) belonging to the same family and genus as HCV causes an analogous disease to HCV in new world monkeys, including marmosets [ 33 – 37 ]. In addition to their immunological similarity, marmosets have similar suites of body composition, alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism as observed in humans and other nonhuman primates [ 38 – 41 ]. They are more prone to developing insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, NAFLD and obesity and are used as models for the same conditions [ 38 – 40 ]. Collectively, the increasing knowledge of marmoset immunology and metabolic pathways, limited size and cost, and availability of cross-reactive reagents makes marmosets an attractive animal model.    Methods   Ethics statement and animals  Six common marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus ) were used for this study and were housed in BSL2 biocontainment facilities at the New England Primate Research Center in accordance with the guidelines of the local institutional animal care and use committee, and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Harvard University IACUC approved all procedures prior to study. All animals were socially housed and enrolled in the NEPRC environmental enrichment program designed to provide mental and sensory stimulation and promote development of behavioral and logical skills using varied stimuli (i.e., foraging devices). Blood draws consisted of no more than 1% of body weight and not more than 3 ml. Post-blood draw analgesics were administered at the discretion of the veterinarian. Animals were fed a commercial new world nonhuman primate diet, which was supplemented with fruits, vegetables, eggs and nuts. Water was available ad libitum. Additional information on the animals used in this study is found in Table 1 . Animals were weighed at weekly intervals for the first 4 weeks followed by monthly weight measurements until day 168 post-infection (pi). Sequential blood draws were performed pre- and post- GBV-B inoculation during morning hours for every time point. For all procedures animals were sedated with ketamine (40–50 mg/kg). Animals were sacrificed at 168 days pi with IV administration of an overdose (>>50 mg/kg) of pentobarbital verified by auscultation with a stethoscope. Evident post mortem pathology was recorded by the attending veterinarian and pathologist.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170240.t001  Table 1  Pathological lesions in GBV-B infected animals.

Blood chemistry  Whole blood was also collected at indicated time points and sera were collected at monthly intervals. At pre-infection and monthly time points 0.5 to 1ml (based on body weight of the animal) of whole blood and 1 ml of clotted blood was collected; 0.5ml of blood was collected at day 7, 14 and 21 pi. Blood cell counts were performed by automated analysis (Hemavet HV 1700FS instrument), and biochemical analyses were performed by standard veterinary diagnostics (IDEXX, Grafton MA). The medians and ranges of serum enzymes and analytes of animals at baseline (day 0) are shown in Table 2 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170240.t002  Table 2  Serum chemistry baseline/normal values.

The scores for hepatic steatosis were as follows: None-0, Mild-1, Moderate-2, Severe-3.    Luminex assay  Marmoset plasma samples were analyzed for glucagon, glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose inhibitory peptide (GIP), insulin, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor type -1 (PAI-1), resistin, and visfatin by Luminex [ 43 ]. Due to limited availability of samples, plasma samples of only three animals (228–07, 16–07 and 27–09) were analyzed.    Statistics  Statistical significance of difference was determined by non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test or paired Students t test using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. Differences between the mean ranks of different time points compared to the mean rank of day 0 were considered significant when the p value was less than 0.05. Correlations between metabolic and biochemical factors were analyzed by Spearman correlation test using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software.     Results   Clinical presentation of GBV-B infection  Six marmosets were infected with GBV-B and the clinical course of the disease was studied longitudinally over 168 days pi. Viral loads were analyzed in the plasma of infected animals by real time PCR [ 42 ]. Post-infection, there was a reduction in percent body weight coinciding approximately with peak mean viremia ( Fig 1 ). Up to 5 to 10% loss in body weight was observed in all animals when compared to baseline values (median = 0.43 kg; range = 0.303–0.496 kg). A return to normal body weight and expected weight gain only occurred after viral clearance.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170240.g001  Fig 1   GBV-B viremia and transient weight loss.  Kinetics of mean plasma viral load determined by real time PCR and body weight measurements expressed as percent changes compared to baseline values in GBV-B infected marmosets.       Hematological changes in GBV-B infection  Reduction in the total white blood cell count in all animals was observed at day 28 and at later time points ( Fig 2A ). Similarly significant loss in lymphocyte count was observed in all animals except 282–06 at days 28 and 56 pi ( Fig 2B ). Interestingly, platelet counts increased significantly at days 28, 140 and 168 pi ( Fig 2C ). RBC numbers reduced, although not significantly coinciding with the leukocyte counts at day 28, but not at later time points ( Fig 2D ). No significant differences were observed in eosinophils, basophils and monocytes (data not shown).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170240.g002  Fig 2   Changes in blood cell counts during GBV-B infection.

Asterisk indicates significant differences between mean of respective time point and day 0 by Kruskal Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison at p value < 0.05.       Biochemical changes indicative of tissue inflammation  Sera at baseline (day 0, Table 2 ) and time points’ pi were analyzed for several biochemical parameters. As observed in other reports [ 44 – 46 ], serum enzymes such as alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) indicative of hepatitis were elevated in infected animals although they were not correlated with viral loads [ 42 ]. Gamma glutamyl aminotransferase (GGT), another serum enzyme associated with liver damage in marmosets [ 39 ], was elevated by at least 1.5 to 2-fold in all infected animals when compared to day 0 values ( Fig 3A ). Decreases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were observed at all time points ( Fig 3B ). Creatine Kinase (CK) was elevated by more than 2-fold than baseline values in all animals at different time points ( Fig 3C ) suggesting in addition to liver damage, more generalized activation or cardiovascular damage. No significant changes were observed in levels of albumin, globulin, total proteins and electrolytes such as calcium, phosphorous, chloride, potassium and sodium (data not shown).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170240.g003  Fig 3   Changes in serum biochemistry.  Serum biochemistry for (A) gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), (B) blood urea nitrogen (BUN), (C) creatine kinase (CK) in GBV-B infected marmosets.       Dysregulated glucose metabolism in GBV-B infection  Serum glucose and plasma hormones involved in glucose metabolism were monitored at monthly time points post infection. A transient but consistent decline in blood glucose was observed by day 28 pi, returning to normal levels by viral clearance ( Fig 4A ). Based on sample availability, plasma from only three animals—228–07, 16–07 and 27–09 were analyzed for hormones involved in glucose metabolism by Luminex assay. The major pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon were increased at multiple time points in all three animals ( Fig 4B & 4C ). GIP and GLP-1 are incretin hormones produced by the gut. While GLP-1 was elevated at days 28, 56 and 168 at significant levels ( Fig 4D ) in the three animals, GIP was increased in 228–07 and 16–07 but not in 27–09 ( Fig 4E ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170240.g004  Fig 4   Dysregulated glucose and associated hormones in GBV-B infected animals.  Changes in (A) glucose, (B) insulin, (C) glucagon, (D) GLP-1 and (E) GIP in plasma of infected marmosets by luminex assay. Asterisk indicates significant differences between mean of respective time point and day 0 by paired t test at p value < 0.05.       Lipid dysfunctions in infected animals  Altered lipid profiles that drive steatosis and insulin resistance have been previously associated with HCV infection [ 47 – 49 ]. In GBV-B-infected marmosets, serum cholesterol levels were generally not variable ( Fig 5A ), whereas elevated triglycerides were observed at later time points exceeding 400mg/dL in animals 228–07, 16–07 and 27–09 ( Fig 5B ). Triglyceride concentrations more than 400mg/dL is considered as hypertriglyceridemia in marmosets [ 38 ]. Interestingly, the animal 228–07 had high triglyceride levels even at baseline, which further increased by 2 to 3-fold at later time points.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170240.g005  Fig 5   Dyslipidemic profile in GBV-B infected animals.  Changes in (A) cholesterol, (B) triglycerides, (C) PAI-1, (D) resistin, (E) visfatin and (F) leptin in plasma of infected marmosets by luminex assay. Asterisk indicates significant differences between mean of respective time point and day 0 by paired t test at p value < 0.05.     Adipocytokines are cytokines secreted by adipose tissues and are associated with obesity and insulin resistance. PAI-1, visfatin, resistin and leptin are some of the adipocytokines that were analyzed in the plasma of 228–07, 16–07 and 27–09. Increases in PAI-1 as high as 10-fold or more were observed in all three animals at most time points of the study ( Fig 5C ). Resistin was elevated in animals 228–07 and 16–07 and reached significant levels at day 168 ( Fig 5D ). Interestingly, resistin levels correlated with triglyceride levels (r = 0.759, p<0.001) in the plasma of infected animals. Visfatin was increased in 27–09 at day 28 pi, and in 16–07 at later time points ( Fig 5E ). No major changes were observed in leptin levels ( Fig 5F ).    Pathological changes towards hepatic steatosis in infected animals  At day 168 pi all infected animals were necropsied and gross pathology was noted. Table 1 lists the various anomalies detected in internal organs of infected marmosets. The most common observations included enlarged liver, spleen and lymph nodes and mottled kidneys.  Previous observations from our lab confirmed the presence of hepatitis and liver fibrosis in GBV-B-infected animals by histopathological evaluation [ 42 ]. Further examination for steatosis revealed cytoplasmic vacuoles with peripheral nuclei indicating macrovesicular steatosis in the liver of infected animals at day 168 pi compared to normal animals ( Fig 6 ). Quantitative evaluation of liver histopathology identified varying levels of steatotic changes in all infected animals–ranging from mild steatosis in 123–10 to severe steatosis in 27–09 ( Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170240.g006  Fig 6   Hepatic steatotic lesions in GBV-B infected animals.  Representative micrographs show histopathological changes associated with liver steatosis by H&E (magnification,400x; scale bar 100μm) in healthy and GBV-B infected marmosets.        Discussion  Previous studies including our own observations have shown that GBV-B induces acute hepatitis in marmosets and tamarins with elevated serum enzymes such as ALT, isocitrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase [ 42 , 44 – 46 ]. However, the hematological, biochemical and metabolic changes over the course of GBV-B infection have not been described in detail. In this study, marmosets infected with GBV-B were assessed for changes in both hematological and serum metabolic parameters from onset of infection until after viral clearance.  Many flaviviruses infect hematopoietic cells which, as a general feature of this family of viruses, can lead to neutropenia, bone marrow hypocellularity and abnormal megakaryocyte formation [ 50 ]. Thrombocytopenia in combination with leukopenia and hemolysis secondary to HCV infection has been reported [ 51 ]. Interestingly, although virus was cleared in most animals by days 28 or 56, recovery of lymphocyte counts was observed much later. However, leukopenia and decreased RBC levels observed in most animals at day 28 could be the result of repeated phlebotomy within the first month of infection. Although thrombocytopenia has been specifically associated with chronic HCV [ 52 – 55 ], platelet counts were not reduced in GBV-B infection. A probable reason for the difference in platelet count between the two hepaciviruses could be the generally acute nature of GBV-B infection which might be insufficient in duration compared to chronic HCV to induce thrombocytopenia.  Dysfunctions of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance are common features in chronic hepatitis due to the major role(s) the liver plays in glucose metabolism. Indeed HCV directly interrupts signaling in the insulin receptor substrate-1 pathway through its core protein [ 56 ]. Most infected animals showed evidence of an acute hypoglycemia, but also exhibited elevated levels of insulin, glucagon and GLP-1 ( Fig 4 ). Hyperinsulinemia has been demonstrated in chronic HCV infection [ 57 , 58 ], and both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglucagonemia can be found in cirrhotic patients [ 59 ]. GIP is elevated in type 2 diabetes mellitus and in impaired glucose tolerant patients [ 60 , 61 ] while GLP-1 improves insulin sensitivity in mice and humans [ 62 ]. However, the changes of glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP hormones in viral hepatitis induced insulin resistance are not completely clear [ 63 , 64 ].  Other than insulin resistance, the metabolic complications most commonly associated with chronic HCV infection include hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia [ 65 – 68 ]. Patients with hepatic steatosis had significantly increased serum triglycerides than HCV-infected patients without hepatic steatosis [ 69 ], and severity of liver injury has been correlated with low cholesterol levels [ 70 – 72 ]. Marmosets infected with a HCV/GBV-B chimera demonstrated pathological changes in liver including lymphocyte infiltration, hepatic edema, cholestasis and ultrastructural changes such as lipid droplets indicative of fatty liver degeneration [ 73 ]. In this study, infected animals showed accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes as evidenced by steatosis in liver and additionally hepatomegaly ( Table 1 ), thus recapitulating NAFLD in humans. Further, necrotic hepatocellular structures, inflammatory cell infiltration and mild levels of fibrosis in liver were observed in the same cohort of animals [ 42 ] indicating progression of liver injury towards NASH. This data is in accordance with the marmoset model of NAFLD and NASH where elevated serum GGT and triglycerides were suggested as useful biochemical markers of liver dysfunction [ 39 , 74 ].  Obesity and insulin resistance are independent negative predictors for SVR in chronic hepatitis C patients undergoing combination therapy [ 75 ]. Adipose tissue derived cytokines or adipocytokines are reported to play an important role in the development of obesity derived insulin resistance [ 76 , 77 ]. Resistin, an adipocytokine was higher in NAFLD patients with moderate/severe liver fibrosis than patients with mild fibrosis [ 78 ]. Hyperresistinemia has been reported in Chronic HCV patients [ 48 , 79 ] and IL-8 and resistin levels predicted severe/moderate fibrosis in HCV infected patients [ 79 ]. At day 168 pi, significant hyperresistinemia was observed in infected animals. In addition, association between resistin and triglyceride levels indicates that viral hepatitis could drive insulin resistance and lipid dysregulation. PAI-1, another adipocytokine, was elevated in infected animals 2-fold up to 30-fold. PAI-1 levels were associated with triglyceride levels in chronic HCV patients [ 49 ]. Elevated PAI-1 levels have been associated with diabetic nephropathy [ 80 , 81 ]. Renal complications such as albuminuria, cryoglobulinemia-induced glomerulonephritis and chronic kidney disease have all been associated with HCV infection [ 82 – 84 ]. Abnormal changes in BUN were observed in some animals and could indicate renal disease. Acute experimental liver damage in cirrhotic rats also induced renal dysfunction with increases in serum creatinine, bilirubin, and BUN levels [ 85 ]. Collectively, these data suggest that GBV-B, like many other viral infections, could induce kidney dysfunction, but it is also important to point out that marmosets have a propensity to develop spontaneous benign glomerulonephropathy [ 86 – 88 ]. Thus, further studies will be necessary to determine if kidney disease is a true complication of GBV-B infection. Further, a general state of chronic inflammation is associated with these metabolic aberrations [ 25 – 27 ]. In all GBV-B infected animals, CK was elevated up to 18-fold above baseline. Multiple studies have founded elevated CK and myositis associated with HCV infection [ 89 – 92 ]. This is further supported by the gross pathological observations of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, kidney lesions and peripheral lymphadenopathy–indicative of an underlying state of inflammation caused by GBV-B infection and similarity to HCV disease.  In summary, despite the relatively low numbers of animals evaluated in this study, our data suggest that GBV-B infection in marmosets could induce significant clinical and metabolic dysregulation as evidenced by hypertriglyceridemia and potential pre-diabetic manifestations similar to disease found in HCV infection of humans. The most notable similarities were signs of systemic inflammation, liver damage, dysfunctional lipid and glucose metabolism, all of which could influence progression of disease and/or response to treatment. Although the measurement of non-fasting plasma glucose is a caveat in this study, several pre-diabetic parameters such as adipocytokine dysregulation in combination with lipid dysregulation indicates a risk of diabetic manifestation. In addition, steatotic changes in liver confirmed triglyceride accumulation leading to fatty liver degeneration. Further, these metabolic aberrations were seen in animals even after virus was completely cleared, which could be indicative of permanent liver damage resulting in progressive dysregulation of metabolic pathways irrespective of virus replication. Therefore, GBV-B infection, regardless of duration, might induce hematologic and metabolic dysfunctions in marmosets similar to those observed in HCV, but the full mechanism of hepacivirus-induced metabolic disease will require further study in additional animal cohorts. Nonetheless, the similarity of disease between the marmoset model and humans could help to better understand the role(s) metabolic dysfunction plays in disease pathogenesis as well as evaluations of these disease complications when considering treatment.

Different housing systems can be used in pig production and little is known about their effect on gut microbiota composition. In this study we characterized fecal microbiota by sequencing the rRNA genes in sows kept during gestation in conventional pens with a slatted floor and in enriched pens with a floor covered with deep straw. After farrowing, microbiota of 1- and 4-day-old piglets were also monitored. Microbiota of sows from the enriched system contained significantly more Prevotella , Parabacteroides , CF231, Phascolarctobacterium , Fibrobacter , Anaerovibrio and YRC22 and significantly less Lactobacillus , Bulleidia , Lachnospira , Dorea , Ruminococcus and Oscillospira than microbiota of sows from the conventional system. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio was 0.96 in the microbiota of sows kept in the enriched pens and this increased to 1.66 in the microbiota of sows kept in the conventional system. The production system therefore influenced microbiota composition, most likely due the ingestion of the straw. The microbiota of 1- and 4-day-old piglets differed from the microbiota of sows and sows therefore did not represent the most important source for their colonization in early days of life.

Butyrate produced by commensal microbiota is the most preferred energy source for colonocytes [ 1 ]. Microbiota also degrade complex polysaccharides and bacterial species belonging to the genus Bacteroides forage on host proteins forming the mucus above epithelial cells [ 2 ]. Beneficial species in gut microbiota prevent the multiplication of pathogens by simple competition for available nutrients. Finally, gut microbiota stimulates the immune system thus playing a crucial role in neonate immune system maturation [ 3 ]. Correct colonization of the intestinal tract, in the early days of life in particular, is therefore of utmost importance for any individual and the quality of this early colonization may determine the extent of digestive disorders occurring during the first weeks of life or affect long term intestinal homeostasis [ 4 , 5 ].  Colonization of the intestinal tract in piglets is initiated at birth by microbiota from the maternal genital and intestinal tract. Soon after, colonization of the intestinal tract of newborns is complemented by microbiota from the environment. Depending on management and production conditions, the importance of maternal and environmental microbiota sources may vary considerably. In pig production, the cleaning procedures applied in the farrowing unit prior to entrance of the sows decrease the occurrence of environmental microbiota. Despite this, it is difficult to predict to what extent the sows are responsible for the development of microbiota in piglets. There is a report showing that administration of probiotics to sows during gestation affects piglet microbiota composition suggesting a maternal influence [ 6 ]. On the other hand, a higher similarity of microbiota between piglets co-inhabiting the same pen in comparison to separated siblings rather favors the environmental effect [ 7 ].  Various production systems, which may affect gut microbiota composition, are used in pig production. One example is represented by the conventional and organic farming systems. However, when microbiota composition in pigs in conventional or organic farming was compared, there were no extensive differences and microbiota of conventional and organic pigs were alike [ 8 ]. Similarly, no significant differences in the composition of microbiota of indoor and outdoor kept pigs were reported [ 9 ]. Various systems are in use also for rearing sows during gestation. The most widespread production system is characterized by a simple slatted floor but alternative enriched systems with deep straw bedding are also in use. In the latter system, lower stress and the consumption of straw containing a non-digestible fiber may have an impact on gut microbiota [ 10 , 11 ]. To address this hypothesis, here we characterized the fecal microbiota of sows kept in conventional and enriched pens during gestation. In addition, we investigated whether a maternal housing system may affect the development of microbiota in piglets during their first week of life.    Material and Methods   Ethical statement  The experiment was carried out at the experimental farm of Creécom (Chambre d’Agriculture de Bretagne, France). Animals were reared following French guidelines for animal care and use. The experimental protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments in Rennes (Comité Rennais d'Ethique en matière d'Expérimentation Animale), France, and the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research (agreement n° 02805.02). All sampled animals were returned back to the commercial production at the end of the experiment.    Animals and experimental design  Large-White x Landrace sows were divided into 2 independent farrow-to-finish units with identical management strategies, but differing in the housing environment for gestating sows. Pens in the conventional unit were furnished with a concrete slatted floor with 2.4 m 2 space per sow, and pens in the enriched unit were covered with deep straw with more space per animal (3.4 m 2 per sow). All sows were transferred to identical individual farrowing crates (2.25 x 0.5 m) with a slatted floor at gestation day 105. When needed, piglet adoptions were performed among litters of the same treatment group to equalize the size of the litters. Common procedures (iron injection, tooth grinding, tail resection, castration) were applied between 24 and 72 hours after birth. Sows were fed a standard gestation and lactation diet.  The experiment was repeated on 3 replicates with 3 different batches of sows that farrowed in April 2014, September 2014 and January 2015. Fecal samples were collected from sows during farrowing (sows originating from the conventional system: n = 6, 6 and 6, and from the enriched system: n = 6, 8 and 7, in batch 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Fecal samples were collected from piglets on day 1 of life in the first replicate (13 piglets of the 6 sows from the conventional system and 11 piglets of the 6 sows from the enriched system). Fecal samples were also collected from 4-day-old piglets (n = 9, 13 and 16 piglets of sows the conventional system and 9, 15 and 14 piglets of sows from the enriched pens in batch 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Sample collection on day 1 was performed before starting the adoption procedures, and piglets sampled on day 4 were pigs that remained with their mother from birth (i.e. non-adopted piglets) although some piglets in their litter could have originated from another biological mother and thus may have brought a different flora. Altogether 139 fecal samples (39 samples from sows, 24 from 1-day-old piglets and 76 from 4-day-old piglets) were collected and analyzed. Immediately after collection into a cryotube, fecal samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C. Age of sampled piglets was selected as the time point when caused of piglet mortality shift from nutritional (starvation) and accidental (crushing) causes to infectious causes, including digestive disorders and diarrhea.    Microbiota characterization  Fecal samples were homogenized using zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a MagNALyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Following homogenization, the DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). The DNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically and the DNA was stored at −20°C until use. Prior to PCR, DNA samples were diluted to 5 ng/μl and used as a template in PCR with forward primer 5′- TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG -MID-GT- CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG -3′ and reverse primer 5′- GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG -MID-GT- GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC -3′ . The sequences in italics served as an index and adapter ligation while underlined sequences allowed for amplification over V3/V4 region of eubacterial 16S rRNA genes. MIDs represent different sequences of 5, 6, 9 or 12 bp in length designed to differentiate samples. PCR amplification and clean up were performed using the KAPA Taq HotStart PCR kit (Kapa Biosystems). In the next step the concentration of PCR products was determined spectrophotometrically, the DNA was diluted to 100 ng/μl and groups of 14 PCR products with different MID sequences were indexed with a Nextera XT Index Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Prior to sequencing, the concentration of differently indexed samples was determined using a KAPA Library Quantification Complete kit (Kapa Biosystems). All indexed samples were diluted to 4 ng/μl and of phiX DNA was added to 20% final concentration. Sequencing was performed using MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 and MiSEQ 2000 apparatus according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina).  The fastq files generated after Illumina sequencing were uploaded into Qiime software [ 12 ]. Quality trimming criteria were set to a value of 19 and no mismatch in the MID sequences. Reverse reads were shortened to a length of 250 bp and forward and reverse sequences were joined. Chimeric sequences were predicted by the slayer algorithm and excluded from subsequent analysis. The resulting sequences were then classified by RDP Seqmatch with an OTU (operational taxonomic units) discrimination level set to 97% followed by UniFrac analysis. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) implemented in Qiime was used for data visualization. The raw sequence reads have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive under the accession number SRP071000.    Comparison of microbiota abundance in animals kept in conventional and enriched systems  Only bacterial genera which were present in more than 90% of tested samples in at least one of the tested categories, i . e . sows, 1-day-old and 4-day-old piglets, were included in this analysis. This selection was adopted to avoid false positive conclusions due to quite unequal coverage of individual samples. Focusing on common microbiota members permitted the use of a t-test applied on the percentual representation of each genus in the population. Comparisons with p<0.05 were considered as significant. Hierarchical clustering was calculated at genus level using genera for which at least 5 reads were available after summing up reads from all samples. This resulted in 189 genera for which percentual representation in each sample was calculated. This table was used for the calculation of distance matrix was using Euclidean distance measure. Hierarchical clustering was then prepared using Ward's linkage method.     Results   Fecal microbiota of sows, 1- and 4-day-old piglets  Altogether 3,404,413 reads were obtained for all the samples. Median read count per sample was 13,411 ranging from 406 reads in the sample with the lowest coverage to 173,766 reads in the sample with the highest coverage. Species abundance and diversity increased in a direction 1-day-old piglets—4-day-old piglets—adult sows. However, comparison of species abundances or diversity indices in animals from conventional or enriched conditions never resulted in statistical significance ( Table 1 ). PCoA clustering showed that microbiota of sows, 1- and 4-day-old piglets differed considerably ( Fig 1A ). Although there was pig-to-pig variation in all age categories, the lowest variation was recorded in the composition of microbiota of sows which formed a well-defined cluster while microbiota of 1- and 4-day old piglets were subjected to greater variation since the two clusters were of a more diffuse shape. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the detected genera confirmed PCoA clustering and also excluded any “experiment” effect since sows and 4-day-old piglets from all 3 experiments were randomly mixed up ( Fig 2 ). Two main clusters were formed within sow microbiota. The first one comprised 22 samples and 8 of these originated from the sows kept under conventional conditions. The second major cluster comprised 13 samples and 8 of these originated from the sows kept under conventional conditions. The second cluster was therefore weakly enriched for sows kept under conventional conditions.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170051.g001  Fig 1   Microbiota composition in sows, 1- and 4-day-old piglets.

Prevotella (phylum Bacteroidetes ) and Oscillospira (phylum Firmicutes ) dominated over the remaining genera and formed nearly 50% of the total microbial population in the faeces of sows at the time of farrowing ( Fig 1B ). Microbiota of 1-day-old piglets was dominated by Escherichia which formed over 50% of total microbiota. An additional 3 genera characteristic of 1-day-old piglets included Clostridium , Fusobacterium and Actinobacillus which together with Escherichia formed over 80% of all microbiota. The most abundant microbiota members of 4-day-old piglets included Bacteroides , Fusobacterium and Prevotella . These 3 genera formed over 60% of total microbiota. Bacteroides formed 30% and Prevotella 10% of microbiota in 4-day-old piglets whilst in sows, Prevotella increased to 24% and Bacteroides decreased to only 1.8% of total microbiota ( Fig 1B ).    Comparison of microbiota abundance in animals kept under conventional and enriched systems  PCoA and hierarchical cluster analysis indicated a minor separation of sows kept under conventional and enriched conditions (Figs 1A and 2 ). In the next step we therefore directly compared the abundance of individual genera in sows kept under different conditions. This analysis showed that 13 genera were differently abundant, 6 being more abundant in the microbiota of sows kept under conventional conditions and 7 being more abundant in microbiota of sows kept under enriched conditions with straw bedding. Although the differences in abundance were only between 1.34 to 5 fold, significant differences were recorded among common microbiota members including the two the most abundant genera, i . e . Prevotella and Oscillospira ( Table 2 ). We also noticed that all genera being of a higher abundance in sows from conventional conditions belonged to the phylum Firmicutes whilst genera of higher abundance in microbiota in sows kept under enriched conditions belonged mainly to the phyla Bacteroidetes or Fibrobacteres . The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in microbiota from sows from conventional conditions was 1.66 whilst this ratio decreased to 0.96 in microbiota of sows kept under enriched conditions with straw bedding.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170051.t002  Table 2  Bacterial genera differently represented (p<0.05) in sows kept under conventional and enriched conditions, and in their piglets.

Veillonella and Pasteurella were more frequent in microbiota of 4-day-old piglets from sows housed in the conventional production system ( Table 2 ).     Discussion  In this study, we analyzed the fecal microbiota composition in sows kept under 2 different production systems during gestation and in their piglets. Escherichia , Clostridium , Fusobacterium and Actinobacillus dominated in the microbiota of 1-day-old piglets. Although Escherichia is the first gut colonizer in different species [ 13 , 14 ], Fusobacterium and Actinobacillus do not belong among commonly reported genera of the gut microbiome in warm blooded vertebrates. On the other hand, Actinobacillus and Fusobacterium colonize the palatine tonsils in pigs [ 15 , 16 ] and their presence in the feces of young piglets might be therefore a consequence of their presence in the palatine tonsils, with limited multiplication along the poorly populated intestinal tract followed by fecal shedding. This is consistent with a report on Actinobacillus’ low abundance in pig fecal microbiota [ 17 ]. The presence of Fusobacterium in fecal microbiota of very young piglets is of concern since Fusobacterium facilitates the development of swine dysentery [ 5 , 18 , 19 ].  In 4-day-old piglets, Bacteroides replaced E . coli as the most abundant microbiota member and Fusobacterium remained highly abundant, similar to a previous report [ 13 ]. The dominance of Bacteroides in the microbiota of 4-day-old piglets was rather unexpected since Bacteroides is not common in the fecal microbiota of adult pigs. Instead, Prevotella dominates over Bacteroides within phylum Bacteroidetes in adult pigs [ 8 , 13 ]. The cause for the transient appearance of Bacteroides is unclear. However, since the same observation has been already recorded [ 20 ], it seems to be a characteristic feature of microbiota development in piglets. An explanation can be sought in lactation, weaning and in changes in host gene expression. Bacteroides forage within the mucus covering gut epithelial cells [ 2 ] whose structure and composition change along the intestinal tract [ 21 ] and perhaps may change also with age. Moreover, IgA secretion into the gut lumen can be detected from day 21 of life with stable production from around day 30 of life [ 3 ] which may also affect microbiota composition.  The microbiota composition of adult sows at the phylum level (52% Firmicutes , 38% Bacteroidetes and 6% Proteobacteria ) was similar to that reported previously [ 8 , 22 – 24 ]. Within Firmicutes , the genera Oscillospira and Ruminoccocus were common both in sows and fattening pigs although Lactobacillus and Clostridium were present in the microbiota of fattening pigs at a much higher abundance [ 8 ] than in sows in this study. The extensive differences in microbiota composition in sows and piglets indicate that sows did not act as a major source of microbiota for piglets during the first days of life. Instead, breast feeding and environmental factors dominated over contact between sows and piglets as has been proposed previously [ 7 ]. However, we cannot exclude that skin, vaginal and breast milk microbiota may affect piglet microbiota what we did not address in this study. We also cannot exclude the role of sow as a donor of microbiota increases around the time of weaning which can be also influenced by different genetic background of each sow and piglet.  The differences in sow fecal microbiota kept under the two production conditions were moderate. Despite this, comparing the abundance of individual bacterial taxa showed that there were significant yet numerically not too extensive differences even among dominant genera. All 6 genera showing higher abundance in microbiota of sows kept under conventional conditions belonged to phylum Firmicutes . On the other hand, out of 7 genera exhibiting higher abundance in the microbiota of sows kept in enriched pens, 4 belonged to phylum Bacteroidetes and 1 to phylum Fibrobacteres . The representatives of Bacteroidetes and Fibrobacteres were repeatedly characterized as having the potential to metabolise non-soluble polysaccharides like cellulose, hemicellulose or pectin [ 25 – 27 ]. Since part of the enriched production system was a deep bedding of straw, the ingestion of straw enriched the feed with non-soluble polysaccharides and likely positively selected for the representatives of Bacteroidetes and Fibrobacteres . Although we did not address specifically microbiota composition in the cecum or colon, it is likely that microbiota in freshly collected fecal material correspond with the microbiota in distal parts of intestinal tract and may therefore influence sows metabolism and behavior.  In this study we have shown that the microbiota of sows kept under rearing conditions with or without a deep bedding of straw differed slightly with straw positively selecting for bacteria from phyla Bacteroides and Fibrobacteres . However, these differences were not reflected in the composition of microbiota of their piglets. The development of fecal microbiota in early days of piglet life was quite rapid and at least in the first days of life was not determined by sow microbiota. This is different from newly hatched chicken which can be easily populated by microbiota from adult hens [ 27 ]. It is likely the different feed composition delays the population of piglet intestinal tract by microbiota from adult sows. We therefore cannot exclude more important role of sows in shaping gut microbiota of their offspring around the time of weaning. In addition, microbiota colonizing skin or mammary gland were not analyzed in this study though it may also contribute the formation of gut microbiota in piglets.

Fixation with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) is one of the most common methods for stabilizing intertrochanteric fractures, except for unstable and reverse oblique fracture types. However, failure is often observed in osteoporotic patients whereby the lag screw effectively ‘cuts out’ through the weak bone. Novel anti-migration blades have been developed to be used in combination with a lag screw (‘Blade Screw’) to improve the fixation strength in osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures. An in-vitro biomechanical study and a retrospective clinical study were performed to evaluate lag screw migration when using the novel Blade Screw and a traditional threaded DHS. The biomechanical study showed both the Blade Screw and DHS displayed excessive migration (≥10 mm) before reaching 20,000 loading cycles in mild osteoporotic bone, but overall migration of the Blade Screw was significantly less (p ≤ 0.03). Among the patients implanted with a Blade Screw in the clinical study, there was no significant variation in screw migration at 3-months follow-up (P = 0.12). However, the patient’s implanted with a DHS did display significantly greater migration (P<0.001) than those implanted with the Blade Screw. In conclusion, the Blade Screw stabilizes the bone fragments during dynamic loading so as to provide significantly greater resistance to screw migration in patients with mild osteoporosis.

Dynamic hip screw (DHS) is one of the primary choices for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures (AO 31-A1). However, there is also an inherently failure risk with the use of a DHS, possibly down to the lag screw design. Madsen et al. [ 2 ] showed that 9% of patients receiving a DHS had a secondary fracture dislocation within a six month follow-up period, leading to complications such as varus malunion, lag screw cut-out or excessive lag screw sliding with medialization of the distal fracture fragment. In addition, postoperative fracture instability with secondary complications is frequently reported in severely osteoporotic patients [ 1 – 5 ]. In a sample of 178 intertrochanteric fractures treated with a DHS with a minimum of one year follow-up, Kim et al. [ 5 ] reported a complication rate in osteoporotic bone of greater than 50%. Poor bone quality is a major risk factor for intertrochanteric fractures, which could lead to an increased failure rate for implants or collapse and lag screw cut-out from the superior aspect in older patients [ 3 , 4 ].  Internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in osteoporotic bone is a challenge for orthopaedic and trauma surgeons. Osteoporosis reduces the thickness of cortical bone and increases the porosity of cortical and trabecular structures. This can subsequently lead to implant failure and joint collapse, as one the primary indicators of the mechanical stability of implants is bone quality. Various techniques and implants have been developed to enhance implant stability in osteoporotic bones and reduce lag screw cut-out. With the use of cement-augmented lag screws, Szpalski et al. [ 6 ] reported a higher success rate and lower incidence of cut-out complications in osteoporotic elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures compared to those implanted with a conventional DHS. Lee et al. [ 7 ] investigated the use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement augmentation in 108 elderly patients and indicated that the PMMA cemented DHS achieved superior fixation and patient outcome than a conventional DHS. However, PMMA cement augmentation has also been shown to induce additional complications, such as femoral head osteonecrosis, infection, subcapital femoral neck fracture, and partial destruction of the femoral head [ 8 ]. Wu et al. [ 9 ] also demonstrated that the failure modes of a cemented DHS were different from a conventional DHS, in that they were more likely to result in delayed union, nonunion and breakdown of the side plate. In order to avoid such complications with the use of a cemented DHS, several devices have been developed for stabilizing intertrochanteric fractures by adding an anchoring function to the lag screw [ 10 , 11 ].  To improve the fixation strength in intertrochanteric fractures, a bladed screw design was developed which combines a conventional lag screw shape with two anti-migration blades running along the length of the screw barrel ( Fig 1 ) (Blade Screw; ODRC Dynamic Hip Screw System, Chin Bone Corp., Taiwan; US FDA 510(k): K103015). The addition of these longitudinal blades provides a number of advantages in terms of potentially reducing the risk of cut-out. Inserting the two blades into femoral head through the lateral cortical compacts the surrounding cancellous bone structure. After insertion, any movement of the femoral head would act to further compact the cancellous bone in the region of the blade surface. Also, the increased lateral surface area offered by the blades achieves the previously mentioned anchoring function. The increased support surface could theoretically decrease the rate of lag screw migration, which is important in improving fragment fixation and postoperative results. Therefore, the purposes for this study was 1) to compare lag screw migration and cut-out between the Blade Screw and a conventional DHS through in vitro gait simulation, and 2) to identify signs of early lag screw migration on two-dimensional radiographs of intertrochanteric fractures treated using the Blade Screw and a DHS.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170048.g001  Fig 1    (a) Blade Screw DHS (ODRC Dynamic Hip Screw System, Chin Bone Corp., Taiwan; US FDA 510(k): K103015).

Materials and Methods   In vitro biomechanical tests  Two grades of commercially available synthetic bones were tested in this study. An open-cell rigid polyurethane foam with a density of 0.09 g/cm 3 (Type 1522–524, Pacific Research Inc., Vashon, Washington, USA) represented the homogeneous and uniform material properties of severely osteoporotic cancellous bone. A cellular rigid polyurethane foam (Type 1522–11, Pacific Research Inc., Vashon, Washington, USA) was used to simulate mild osteoporotic bone. The polyurethane foams were purchased in blocks and molded to the shape of a femoral head with a radius of 19 mm, height of 20 mm and a base thickness of 10 mm ( Fig 2 ). In total 36 femoral head models were created, 18 from each grade of sawbone. These were subsequently tested grouped into two categories for testing on the two lag screws: the Blade Screw and conventional DHS (DHS Screw, Synthes, USA). 9 sawbones from each grade were tested on each screw. The barrel of the Blade Screw has a length of 120 mm and an outer thread diameter of 12.7 mm. The blades themselves run along the barrel with a length of 110 mm and a width of 4.4 mm. The DHS has a length of 120 mm and an outer thread diameter of 12.7 mm.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170048.g002  Fig 2   (a) Size of a test block; (b) Cellular rigid polyurethane foam (Type 1522–11) used to simulate a mild osteoporotic bone; (c) Open-cell rigid polyurethane foam (Type 1522–524) used to simulate a severely osteoporotic bone.     The lag screws were implanted into a central position in the femoral head test models. Before inserting the screw, a pilot hole was gimleted into the femoral head using a 10.5 mm drill bit. The cannulated lag screw was then inserted through the pilot hole, and the tip of screw was kept at distance of 10 mm from the apex of the femoral head. Accurate screw insertion was confirmed using a custom-made guide to ensure the proper distance and location of the lag screw within the femoral head. The femoral head test models were placed in a polished steel shell with a thickness of 6 mm which provides a rigid and spherical interface for the dynamic gait simulations.  A hip implant performance simulator (HIPS) system was created to evaluate lag screw migration in each femoral head test model after multi-axial loading that simulates walking conditions ( Fig 3 ) [ 12 ]. The upper fixture of the HIPS system was fitted with a load cell for recording forces on the fixture. A 23° inclined block was also attached to the upper fixture. The lower fixture of the HIPS system simulated a femoral shaft with its anatomic axis aligned perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the material testing machine (MTS, BOSE 3510-AT). The superior surface of the lower fixture was oriented at 40° to the anatomic axis of the simulated femoral shaft to resemble an intertrochanteric fracture line. A polyethylene ‘support’ plate was also attached to the lower fixture to reproduce the constraint characteristics of a reduction in an intertrochanteric fracture [ 13 ]. The femoral head test model implanted with a lag screw was fixed to the superior surface of the lower fixture. In addition, the bottom of the femoral head test model is a cuboid shape, which sits into a corresponding cuboid attachment at the base of the steel shell.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170048.g003  Fig 3   A femoral head test model was fixed in the HIPS system and subjected to multi-axial loading.     The test structure was subjected to sinusoidal loading ranging from 5 N to 1,450 N at a frequency of 1 Hz, simulated walking conditions [ 12 ]. To simulate the hip joint motions during gait, concurrent flexion-extension and abduction-adduction motions were superimposed by sinusoidal rotation of the 23° inclined loading block. According to Ehmke et al. [ 12 ], the 23° inclination could account for an 18° resultant joint load vector and a 5° valgus angle of the femoral shaft axis. Excessive gait kinematics of a limb was simulated by ± 75° rotation of the actuator, resulting in a 45° arc of flexion-extension and a 17° arc of abduction-adduction. The test was stopped when axial displacement of the actuator reached 10 mm, defined as excessive migration, or loading reached 20,000 cycles [ 12 ].  Four marks were placed 90° apart on the surface rim of the steel shell. Spatial migration of the femoral head test model in relation to the lag screw was continuously recorded using a pure video-based tracking and analysis software (Tracker Video Analysis and Modeling Tool) [ 14 ]. An independent t-test was used to compare differences in displacement of the femoral head (DFH), displacement of the distal lag screw tip (DDLS), varus collapse (VC), and rotation around the neck axis (RN).    Clinical follow-up and the measurement of tip apex distance  From May 2013 to July 2014, intertrochanteric fracture fixation was performed by the same surgeon on twenty female patients: 11 fixed with a Blade Screw and 9 fixed with a conventional DHS. Inclusion criteria were low bone mineral density (T-score < = -2.0), stable intertrochanteric fractures (AO/OTA 31-A1/2) and a minimum of 3 months follow-up. Additional exclusion criteria were incomplete chart records, radiographs not meeting diagnostic standards and loss to follow-up. Both patient groups presented classifiable intertrochanteric fractures (AO/OTA 31-A1) with a mean patient age of 76 years (range, 53–101) for the Blade Screw group and a mean age of 80 years (range, 59–93) for the DHS group. No patients presented intraoperative complications, infections or intraoperative or postoperative femoral fracture around the screw tip during a 3-month follow-up period. The bone mineral density (BMD) of all patients was measured and evaluated using a T-score. As lag screw cut-out through the femoral head generally occurs after weight bearing, the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of each patient were collected immediately after surgery and at 3 months follow-up. The distance from the tip of the screw to the apex of the subchondral bone (tip-apex-distance, TAD) was measured with AutoCAD software to determine the position of the lag screw within the femoral head on the AP and lateral radiographs [ 15 , 16 ]. The TAD value was considered as a predictor of lag screw cut-out and has been suggested to be kept less than 25 mm to prevent DHS cut-out failure [ 15 , 16 ]. An independent t-test analysis was used to compare the inter-group differences in age and BMD. A two-factor mixed design ANOVA was used to assess group differences in TAD values immediately after surgery and at 3 months follow-up.  The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan on 20 February 2015 (IRB No.: YM103107WE). All patients provided informed written consent prior to their clinical records being accessed and published and prior to being included in this study.     Results   In vitro biomechanical testing in mild osteoporotic bone model  In the mild osteoporotic femoral models, both screw types demonstrated excessive migration (≥10 mm displacement) before reaching 20,000 loading cycles ( Fig 4a ). The mean number of cycles achieved by the Blade Screw and traditional DHS were 11,000±409 and 6,200±250 cycles respectively. The DFH, DDLS, VC, and RN of the Blade Screw group were all significantly smaller than those recorded from the traditional DHS group at the point of excessive migration (p ≤ 0.03; Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170048.g004  Fig 4   (a) Specimen after lag screw excessive migration (≥10 mm); (b) TAD values of the Blade Screw and traditional DHS groups immediately after surgery and at 3-months follow-up.      10.1371/journal.pone.0170048.t001  Table 1  Displacement of the femoral head (DFH), displacement of the distal lag screw (DDLS), varus collapse (VC), and femoral head rotation around the neck axis (RN) of the Blade Screw and traditional DHS.

In vitro biomechanical testing in severe osteoporotic bone model  In the severe osteoporotic bone models, both screw types demonstrated excessive migration before reaching 1,000 loading cycles. The mean number of loading cycles achieved by the Blade Screw and traditional DHS were 642±26 and 125±11 respectively. At the point of excessive migration, the mean DFH of the Blade Screw was 9.44±0.99 mm, which was significantly less than the traditional DHS (11.26±0.77 mm). Because the bone models were destroyed after relatively few loading cycles, the mean DDLS, VC, and RN could not be accurately recorded or analyzed.    Clinical follow-up and the measurement of tip apex distance  The mean BMD of the Blade Screw group was 0.732±0.1224 g/cm 2 (T score = -2.8) and the mean of traditional DHS group was 0.871±0.2572 g/cm 2 (T score = -2.7). The difference in BMD between the two groups was not significant. Also, no significant difference was detected in mean TAD between the two groups immediately after surgery and at 3-months follow-up. In addition, there was no significant intra-group variation in TAD seen in the Blade Screw group either post-surgery or at follow-up (P = 0.12). However, the mean TAD in the traditional DHS group immediately after surgery was significantly larger than at 3-months follow-up (P<0.001). By using a post hoc power analyses based on the repeated-measures differences in TAD values, the results demonstrated 84% power in detecting time differences at a significance level of 0.05 ( Fig 4b ).     Discussion  This study compared lag screw migration between two lag screw designs, the Blade Screw and a traditional DHS, implanted in osteoporotic bone models. In the mild osteoporotic sawbone models, the Blade Screw group withstood a greater number of loading cycles before reaching the point of excessive migration of the implant (≥10 mm). This indicates a greater resistance to implant migration through the bone. Kouvidis et al. used similar testing protocols to investigate the number of loading cycles to implant failure in single and dual lag screw systems and showed that the average number of cycles leading to cut-out was 6,638 and 10,054, respectively [ 17 ]. In the current study, the amount of loading cycles withstood by the traditional DHS and Blade Screw approximate those of single and dual lag screw systems, signifying the superior cut-out resistance of the Blade Screw. In addition, indicators of lag screw migration (DFH, DDLS, VC, RN) with the Blade Screw were all significantly less than with the traditional DHS ( Table 1 ). This indicates the greater fixation strength of the Blade Screw construct under multidirectional dynamic loading. In addition, the low VC and RN of the Blade Screw also demonstrate its superior resistance to rotation, which is particularly important when the fracture line is perpendicular to the femoral neck. Rotation of a lag screw in this type of fracture would destabilize the femoral head fragments and result in varus collapse under multi-directional loading [ 12 ].  In the severely osteoporotic bone model, both lag screws failed to achieve good bone purchase. Since engagement of the cortex was neglected, the structure of the open-cell rigid polyurethane foam was destroyed before the 1,000 th loading cycle. Therefore, it was not possible to adequately evaluate lag screw migration using the current method. However, the Blade Screw did sustain a greater number of loading cycles before the point of excessive implant migration. Displacement of the femoral head was also less than in the traditional DHS model. The two longitudinal blades on the Blade Screw enlarge the contact surface between the lag screw and bone in the superior-inferior direction, resulting in additional resistance to rotation of the femoral head around the screw.  In addition to the sawbone implantation models, 20 patients exhibiting intertrochanteric fractures were also treated with lag screws; 11 with a Blade Screw and 9 with a DHS. Immediately after surgery and at 3-months follow-up, the mean TAD of both groups was less than 25 mm, indicating a low risk of lag screw cut-out in all patients [ 15 – 20 ]. Although there was no significant inter-group difference in mean TAD immediately after surgery, a significant reduction in mean TAD was observed in the DHS group at 3-months follow-up. This may suggest that the fixation of the lag screw in the femoral head was sufficient enough to limit the relative motion. Furthermore, the postoperative initial stability of intertrochanteric fractures is important for reducing complications associated with long term immobilization and also allows for early rehabilitation [ 21 ]. The steady position of the lag screw within the femoral head observed in the Blade Screw group corresponds with the biomechanical test results. However, further investigation with a long-term follow-up period would be necessary.  There are some limitations to the methods used in this study that should be noted. First, the femoral head bone samples were synthetic bones made of rigid polyurethane foam with isotropic mechanical properties. Although these models might not fully reproduce the biomechanical properties of human bone, these are standardized sawbones that have been shown to provide consistent material properties similar to a human cancellous bone [ 10 , 22 ]. Synthetic bones are the most reliable and reproducible choice for biomechanical testing in the absence of cadaveric bone. They also offer consistency across test samples. Secondly, the in-vitro biomechanical test might not represent the true fracture properties and physical loading of an individual. In addition, micromotion between the polyurethane femoral head and steel shell may affect the accuracy of recording true screw migration. However, a retrospective clinical evaluation of the patients in this study could help determine if the favorable biomechanical test results of the Blade Screw are dependent on clinical practice. Third, the post-surgical follow-up period was short, and possibly not long enough to truly determine the incidence of implant failure. Studies have shown screw cut-out to occur between 1 to 6 months after implantation [ 23 , 24 ]. A longer term study may offer more accurate results on the risk of screw cut-out and other post-surgical complications.    Conclusion  Compared to the traditional DHS, the Blade Screw provides significantly greater resistance to lag screw migration and cut-out in low density bones. The findings of this study show that the Blade Screw design has the advantage of improving the postoperative fixation in osteoporotic bones by securing the fracture fragments during dynamic loading.

Purpose  miRNAs are stable and can be extracted from tissues, blood and other body fluid without degradation. miRNAs are abnormally expressed in the presence of a pathological status, including cancer. Therefore, miRNAs are ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) suffer the worst prognosis, although great efforts have been made. Many studies have investigated the role of miRNAs in predicting the outcomes of TNBC patients for better adjustment of treatment. However, results were inconsistent. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize the published studies for conclusive results.    Methods  Eligible studies from different database were retrieved from the online databases, and we used STSTA 12.0 to analysis the prognostic role of miRNAs in triple negative breast cancer.    Results  Overall high miRNA expression indicated a worse survival with HR value of 1.78 (95% CI: 0.97–3.25). However, subtotal HRs of oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressive miRNAs were 2.73 (95% CI: 2.08–3.57; P <0.001) and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.21–0.90; P = 0.024), respectively, and no heterogeneity was observed within the subgroups.    Conclusions  The miRNAs showed a slightly stronger prognostic value for disease-free survival, relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival compared to the overall survival of TNBC patients. Circulating miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers for the prognosis of TNBC patients and need further investigation.     The authors received no specific funding for this work.          Data Availability  All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0170088.g005   Introduction  Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important component of heterogeneous breast cancer, and, according to the new refinement, it can be subdivided into four subgroups [ 1 , 2 ]. Because TNBC lacks the expressions of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), few effective treatments, with the exception of conventional surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, can provide benefit for TNBC patients. Tremendous efforts regarding the treatment, such as tailoring adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, the discovery of emerging drugable pathways and the resensitization to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, have been carried out to improve the overall outcome of TNBC patients. However, TNBC has the worst prognosis among all breast cancer subtypes [ 3 – 5 ]. It’s believed that finding appropriate prognostic biomarkers for TNBC patients would allow an optimized treatment selection of regimens that could eventually benefit the patients.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved non-coding RNAs (22–25 nt in length), which negatively regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression by partially or completely binding to the 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs) of the target mRNA [ 6 ]. miRNAs have been shown to mediate the cell fate of TNBC by regulating diverse biological processes, such as cell survival, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation[ 7 – 10 ]. Recent studies have confirmed that miRNAs are differentially expressed in tissues, blood and urine of cancer patients and healthy individuals, and they are stable in the presence of severe conditions [ 11 ]. Therefore, miRNAs are endowed with the characteristics of ideal biomarkers, and some studies have shown that miRNAs correlate with poor cancer prognosis, including TNBC [ 12 – 20 ]. However, the opposite results were obtained in several other studies [ 21 – 25 ]. Moreover, with regards to patients with TNBC, many factors, such as the race and age of the patients, the selected miRNA(s), the methodology for miRNA detection and the sample source among different studies, varied, leading to inconsistent outcomes [ 3 , 26 ]. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically study the related references and yield a convincing outcome on whether miRNAs are ideal prognostic biomarkers for patients with TNBC.    Materials and Methods   Literature retrieval strategy  Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology group (MOOSE) was followed to guide the performance of this meta-analysis [ 27 ]. Two reviewers were assigned to independently retrieve literature from the online databases Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The time interval was between January 1st, 1993 and January 1st, 2016. The key words for the literature retrieval strategy included “microRNA”, “miRNA”, “Triple negative breast cancer”, “TNBC”, “basal-like breast cancer”, and “BLBC”. References from eligible publications in the literature were also manually screened for further potential literature.    Criteria for inclusion and exclusion  Eligible literature met the following criteria: (1) clear identification of patients with TNBC; (2) analysis of miRNA expression in tissues, blood or other body fluids; and (3) investigation of the association between miRNA expression levels and outcome of the TNBC patients. Publications were excluded if they had one or more of the following criteria: (1) focus on all types of breast cancer instead of TNBC only; (2) human tissues were not used; (3) absence of survival outcomes, such as the hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and P values or insufficient data to calculate the HR and 95% CI; and (4) review papers, comments, letters or duplicate publications.  When several publications reported on the same TNBC patient group, the most complete publication was included. Moreover, when one publication reported on two or more different independent TNBC patient groups, and the corresponding HR values and 95% CI were provided or could be calculated by Kaplan-Meier curves, the publication was considered as two or more independent studies.    Definition of oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs  According to previous published studies, miRNAs were consideres as tumor suppressive or protective when they were down-regulated compared with normal counterpart, in another word, these miRNAs were associated with an HR value larger than one, otherwise, they were called oncogenic miRNAs or risky miRNAs. In this meta-analysis, each included original study employed different miRNAs, a total HR value was firstly obtained, and then subtotal HR values for oncogenic miRNAs or tumor suppressor miRNAs were calculated.    Quality assessment and data extraction  Two reviewers separately assessed the quality of the included studies using the guideline of the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) [ 28 ], and every study was marked with scores ranging from 0 to 9. The studies with scores greater than a 6 were considered high quality and included in this study. Otherwise, they were removed to enhance the quality of the meta-analysis.  Two reviewers separately extracted the following data from all eligible studies: name of the first author, year of publication, sample number, sample source, type of miRNA(s), methodology, definition of cut-off, follow-up, HR values, 95% CI and P value of miRNAs for predicting overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse-free survival (PFS), and the distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). If two HR values were provided by univariate and multivariate analyses, the HR values from the latter were selected as this value considers confounding factors, which should yield more precise predictions. However, when the HR values and corresponding 95% CIs were not directly provided, we calculated these values using appropriate summary statistics or Kaplan-Meier curves as described by Tierney et al [ 29 ]. Discrepancies or disagreements were resolved by discussion.    Statistical analysis  STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) was adopted to perform all of the meta-analyses. P values were two-sided and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All HR values and their corresponding 95% CIs were used as original data to investigate the collected prognostic value of the overall survival or disease-free survival of TNBC. Generally, a worse prognosis of TNBC was indicated by miRNA over-expression, with pooled HR values over 1.00. Heterogeneity among the HR values was assessed by Cochran’s Q test and Higgins’s I2 statistics. Heterogeneity was taken into consideration when P<0.10 and I2>50%, in which case the random-effect model would be used for the meta-analysis. Otherwise, a fixed-effect model would be used to calculate the pooled HR values. Subgroup analyses or a meta-regression was carried out when necessary. Publication bias was determined by Begg’s funnel plot or Egger’s bias test.     Results   Literature search and study characteristics  We initially acquired a total of 283 relevant items from Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and CNKI, according to the retrieval strategy, and subsequently selected the most relevant 73 articles for a full-text review after the abstract screening. Under the guidance of the inclusive and exclusive criteria, 59 articles were removed because they were systematic reviews, basic preclinical studies, or articles lacking the association of OS or DFS with patients with TNBC. Eventually, 14 articles including 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis ( Fig 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170088.g001  Fig 1   Flow diagram of the identification and selection of the studies.     The characteristics of the included studies and the enrolled patients are presented in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. The 15 studies were published between 2012 and 2015, and a total of 1473 TNBC patients from China (n = 7), the USA (n = 3), Norway (n = 2), Japan (n = 2) and Latvia (n = 1) were enrolled in the meta-analysis. Most of the studies detected the expression of miRNA(s) in the tissues by RT-PCR, and the definitions of cut-off for miRNA expression were different from one other. All of the studies analyzed the predictive value of miRNAs of OS in TNBC patients, and 8 studies also analyzed the association of miRNA(s) with DFS, RFS and DMFS in TNBC patients. Furthermore, we evaluated the quality of each individual study and obtained a median NOS score of 8, which indicated that the included studies were of high quality.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170088.t001  Table 1  Characteristics of the studies included in this meta-analysis.

HR values of single miRNA and combined miRNA subgroups were also obtained, and a worse prognosis was shown for the OS of TNBC patients by the detection of combined miRNAs ( Fig 2 ). More importantly, as miRNAs played distinguished roles in the pathogenesis of TNBC, protective or promotive roles were shown in the studies, and a subgroup analysis was performed within the meta-analysis. Of the 15 studies, 10 employed oncogenic miRNAs and 5 tumor suppressor miRNAs. Subtotal HRs were 2.73 (95% CI: 2.08–3.57; P<0.001) and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.21–0.90; P = 0.024) for oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressive miRNAs, respectively, and no heterogeneity was observed in the subgroup analysis ( Fig 3 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170088.g002  Fig 2   Meta-analysis of subtotal HRs based on single miRNAs and combined miRNAs in predicting the OS of TNBC patients.      10.1371/journal.pone.0170088.g003  Fig 3   Meta-analysis of subtotal HRs based on oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressive miRNAs in predicting the OS of TNBC patients.     The same procedure was applied to investigate the pooled HRs for the DFS, RFS and DMFS of TNBC patients, however, we found that However, we then realized that DFS, RFS and DMFS represented different clinical outcomes, it was inappropriate to treat them as equal. And considering that there were too few analogical studies to conclude solid results about DFS, RFS or DMFS, we thought it would be better to not to perform revenant mata-analysis. Subgroups based on patients’ nationality, methodology for miRNA detection, and sample source were also analyzed to investigate the HR values of miRNAs in predicting OS of TNBC patients, as shown in Table 3 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170088.t003  Table 3  The results of the subgroup analysis.

Sensitivity analysis  Although no heterogeneity was observed within the subgroups of oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs, significant heterogeneity was shown in the comprehensive meta-analysis. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the source of the heterogeneity, and the results showed that the re-pooled HRs were not influenced when any specific study was omitted.

Discussion  TNBC accounts for 12–15% of all breast cancers, and it is the most malignant sub-type with the poorest prognosis. Because of the lack of ER, PgR and HER2 expression, TNBC patients are unlikely to benefit from endocrine therapy or anti-HER2 therapy. For these patients, the only therapeutic options are conventional surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, even within the same cohort, TNBC patients may respond differently to the same chemotherapy. Thus, it is of great significance to identify suitable prognostic biomarkers for the specific treatment or timely adaption of treatment for TNBC patients [ 30 ].  It is well established that miRNAs play important roles in the initiation, development, metastasis and resistance to treatment of TNBC [ 31 , 32 ]. Tumor suppressive miRNAs mediate the degradation or post-transcriptional inhibition of transcripts encoding oncogenes and can target ZEB1/2, HMGB2, Bcl2 and HIF-1α, which contribute to the increased proliferation, invasion, and EMT and reduce the apoptosis of cancer cells. In contrast, oncogenic miRNAs exert the opposite function. Tumor suppressive miRNAs generally tend to be down-regulated in TNBC cells, while oncogenic miRNAs show the opposite change in expression [ 10 ]. miRNAs are more stable than mRNA and DNA, are resistant to harsh environments, and can be extracted without degradation from fresh frozen tissues, paraffin embedded tissues and even blood. Because of these specific features, miRNAs have the potential for extensive clinical use [ 33 – 35 ].  Most of the clinical studies focused on miRNAs as potential prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers in cancer patients, including those in TNBC patients with opposite results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to summarize previous studies and analyze the association of miRNAs with the prognosis of TNBC patients. Overall, our results revealed that high miRNA expression was associated with shorter OS of TNBC patients, with HR values over 1.00. Meanwhile, significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analysis. The source of this heterogeneity was explored by omitting each single study individually and re-pooling the HRs of the remaining studies. However, our results showed that no specific study influenced the overall HR values. Considering that miRNAs play different roles in the pathogenesis of TNBC, we then divided the studies into subgroups based on oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressive miRNAs before performing the meta-analysis. As expected, subtotal HRs of oncogenic and tumor suppressive miRNAs for predicting OS of TNBC patients were 2.73 (95% CI: 2.08–3.57) and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.21–0.90), respectively, with no heterogeneity observed within the subgroups. The pooled HR of tumor suppressive miRNAs was significantly lower than that of oncogenic miRNAs, indicating a better OS for TNBC patients with high expression of tumor suppressive miRNAs. Furthermore, the detection of combined miRNAs showed a worse OS compared to the detection of single miRNAs. Hence, we proposed that the combined detection of miRNAs may serve as a stronger prediction methodPrevious meta-analyses confirmed that circulating miRNAs have a great potential in diagnosing human cancers [ 35 , 36 ], as the expression of circulating miRNAs significantly changes in cancer patients compared to healthy control. Circulating miRNAs may serve as ideal prognostic biomarkers, and the results of this meta-analysis support this hypothesis with a high HR value of 5.32 (95% CI: 2.37–11.93, P<0.0001). However, these results should be interpreted with caution because only two studies conducted by one team were included in this analysis [ 16 ]. Furthermore, the results from studies on Chinese TNBC patients showed a better OS when miRNAs were highly expressed, and most of the reports focused on the tumor suppressive miRNAs. Whether the different ethnicities enrolled in this meta-analysis influenced the results deserves further investigation.  Through this meta-analysis, we intended to found reliable biomarkers that could guide the clinical doctors with better adjustment of treatment. Effective treatment was considered when the expressions of oncogenic miRNAs were decreased or tumor suppressive miRNAs were increased. On the contrary, proper adjustment should be made when the oncogenic miRNAs or tumor suppressive miRNAs show no significant change treatment.  Furthermore, recognizing the oncogenic miRNAs or tumor suppressive miRNAs showed great application in finding new methods of treating patients with triple negative breast camer. Take miR-21, an oncogenic miRNA as proved by the original study for example, when the drugs based on anti-miR-21were effectively delivered into triple negative breast cancer model with RNA-nano technology, the tumor size and ability to invasion or migration were significantly impaired.  Although this meta-analysis suggested a prognostic role of miRNAs in predicting the outcome of TNBC patients, several limitations should be taken into consideration. First, some of the studies lacked direct HR values, and we had to calculate them from the given data. Although we followed the procedure recommended by Tierney et al., different HR values and corresponding 95% CIs may have been obtained. Second, the miRNAs employed in these studies were quite different, along with the methodologies for miRNA detection and the definition of the cut-off values, which were potentially strong sources of heterogeneity. Third, the number of enrolled TNBC patients was not large enough to obtain solid results, and some detailed information, such as age, tumor size, tumor grade and stage, were missing. Fourth, few studies analyzed the association of miRNAs with DFS, RFS and DMFS of TNBC patients, so it was hard to raise persuasive results about the DFS, RFS and DMFS of included patients. Finally, only two studies focused on circulating miRNAs. Thus, whether circulating miRNAs could serve as powerful biomarkers with a prognostic value for TNBC patients requires more comprehensive and elaborately designed studies.    Conclusion  In summary, this study demonstrates that increased expression of tumor suppressive miRNAs predicted favorable outcomes of TNBC patients, and the increased expression of oncogenic miRNAs was associated with negative outcomes. Further, circulating miRNAs could serve as powerful prognostic biomarkers, and this should be verified by targeted studies.

Background  HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Chronic low-grade immune activation is likely one of the driving mechanisms. This systematic review provides an overview of the evidence addressing the relation between immune markers and surrogate markers of CVD (except CIMT) in HIV infection.    Methods  A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library identifying all articles from 1996 to April 2015. It addressed the relation between immune markers and surrogate markers of CVD (except Carotid Intima-media Thickness) in HIV-positive adults. Two authors, using predefined criteria, independently conducted the selection of articles, critical appraisal and extraction of the data. Analysis focused on immune markers that were assessed most frequently. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guideline and performed as part of an overarching review registered with PROSPERO (CRD42014010516).    Findings  Twenty-nine articles were selected, describing 34 immune markers and nine different CVD surrogate outcomes: coronary calcium score (13 times) and flow-mediated dilation (10 times) were used most frequently. Twenty-seven studies had a cross-sectional design. CRP, IL-6 and sVCAM-1 were assessed most frequently. None of the immune markers were clearly associated with any of the surrogate CVD outcomes. No effect estimate could be calculated due to marked heterogeneity in study populations, immune markers, outcomes and statistical approaches.    Interpretation  This review could not identify a clear association between any of the immune markers and surrogate CVD outcomes. This may reflect a true lack of association, or may be explained by heterogeneity across studies and lack of follow-up data. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies measuring a select set of immune markers and surrogate CVD outcomes awaiting the primary outcome of clinical cardiovascular events.     The authors received no specific funding for this work.          Data Availability  All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.    info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0169986.g004   Background  Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has markedly increased life expectancy among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, it has become clear that patients infected with HIV have an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).[ 1 ] Multiple factors contribute to the increased risk for non-AIDS morbidity. An excess burden of traditional risk factors and direct toxic effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are the most likely drivers of the pathogenesis and HIV replication has been shown to contribute to the process of atherosclerosis through chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.[ 2 , 3 ] Increased concentrations of immune biomarkers, like C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 and D-dimer, indicative of inflammatory processes, have been associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and mortality in the general population.[ 4 – 6 ] Research in this area has intensified and several studies have addressed the role of immune activation in the occurrence of CVD in HIV infected individuals, identifying a likely association between CRP, IL-6, d-dimer and clinical CVD.[ 7 ]  To provide insight in the burden of cardiovascular disease in HIV infected individuals while awaiting results from longitudinal studies, a multitude of surrogate markers for CVD have been used. A recent summary of the current body of evidence regarding potential associations between markers of immune activation and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) could not draw a clear conclusion due to the heterogeneity in data.[ 7 ] This systematic review therefore investigates the relation between markers of immune activation and further surrogate markers of CVD like coronary artery calcium score, flow mediated dilation and pulse wave velocity in HIV infected individuals.    Methods  This systematic review was conducted according to the guidelines provided by PRISMA[ 8 ] ( S1 Checklist ) and it is part of a larger review registered in the PROSPERO registry for systematic reviews (Registration number CRD42014010516 ). Results addressing the relation of markers of immune activation, CVD and CIMT were published in January 2016.[ 7 ] http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42014010516 )   Search strategy  A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library on April 29 th 2015 using terms and synonyms for HIV, immune markers and surrogate markers for CVD other than CIMT, covering all evidence from 1996 onward. Terms were limited to title and abstract ( Table 1 ). The search strategy was an update of the search described in the PROSPERO protocol and published previously.[ 7 ]   10.1371/journal.pone.0169986.t001  Table 1  Search strategy.

Firstly, studies were screened on the basis of title and abstract by one author (AH). Studies describing original research including HIV positive patients aged 18 years or above and one of the following surrogate CVD outcomes, were included; CT coronary angiography, coronary artery calcium score (CAC), MRI of blood vessels, arterial inflammation measured by 18FDG PET scan, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (SPECT), flow mediated dilation (FMD), pulse wave velocity (PWV), pulse wave analysis (PWA), ankle brachial index (ABI) and carotid artery stiffness. Animal studies, articles in a language other than English and case-series describing less than 10 cases were excluded. Secondly, two authors (AH, AV) independently evaluated full-text articles using the following exclusion criteria: only poster abstracts, no relation described between immune marker and no description of an outcome of interest. In case of uncertainty regarding the relation between immune marker and outcome, the corresponding author of the study was contacted once for additional data. Discrepancies in inclusion were discussed in a consensus meeting between two reviewers (AV, AH). A third reviewer (KK) would have been available in case of discrepancies, but agreement could be reached for all inclusions.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169986.g001  Fig 1   Flowchart inclusion.  CIMT: carotid intima media thickness, CVD: cardiovascular disease.       Data extraction and critical appraisal  The following data were extracted: study design and enrollment period, duration of follow up, sample size, country, ethnicity, gender, mean age, duration since HIV diagnosis in years, CD4 count, nadir CD4 count, viral load, BMI, percentage of current smokers, percentage of participants on ART, ART regimen, duration of ART in years, immune markers assessed, use of a stored sample, time of measuring outcome versus immune markers and laboratory methods for immune markers. In case a study used more than one surrogate outcome, only the outcome that was related to immune markers was included in the review.  Selected studies were critically appraised, particularly for the risk of selection-, detection-, and attrition bias. Bias risk was assigned as likely, unlikely, or unclear using an adapted Cochrane Collaboration tool. Data extraction and critical appraisal was performed independently by two authors (AH, AV) using a set format.    Analysis  Given heterogeneity of studies, a descriptive analysis, grouped by outcome and most frequently assessed immune markers, was conducted. When possible, percentages of common baseline characteristics were calculated.  Surrogate outcomes of CVD were divided in two groups: outcomes using imaging techniques and outcomes assessing arterial stiffness. Imaging techniques were subdivided in two main categories: 1) coronary angiography and coronary artery calcium score, and 2) all other imaging techniques, namely 18FDG PET scan, SPECT and MRI scan of aortic and carotid arteries. Arterial stiffness outcomes were FMD, PWV, PWA, ABI and carotid artery stiffness. Differences in outcome protocols were not taken into account in this review.  Outcome was reported as a positive association, an inverse association, no association or no data. To combine information from various types of studies reporting often more than one risk estimate per outcome, data were reduced by choosing only one effect estimate per immune marker per surrogate CVD outcome per article. To select the effect estimate, the following hierarchical order was used: 1) outcome of multivariable analysis. If not reported, 2) outcome of univariable analysis. If there was no significant outcome in multi-or univariable analysis, the outcome was scored as 3) ‘No association’. If no data were reported, although the methods section specified that the relation between immune marker and outcome has been studied, the outcome was reported as 4) ‘no data’. In this review C-reactive protein (CRP) refers to both the regular CRP measurement and to the high-sensitive CRP assays.     Results  The updated search identified 169 articles, 64 articles were screened using full text, and 29 articles were finally selected ( Fig 1 ). Articles were excluded if either no relation was described between the immune marker and the surrogate CVD outcome (n = 17), the domain or determinant turned out to be not applicable during full text screening (n = 9) or there was no full text available (n = 9).   Baseline characteristics  A total of 3,559 HIV positive patients were included, whereof the majority were male (median 80%, interquartile range 59.5–92.0%) ( S1 Table ); mean age across studies was 45.3 ± 5.4 years, and on average there were almost as many black as white people included in the studies. All except two studies were conducted in the United States of America or in Europe (one study in Australia[ 9 ] and in Ethiopia)[ 10 ]. Two studies had a longitudinal design with a maximum follow-up duration of 24 weeks.[ 11 , 12 ] Average BMI was 25.1kg/m 2 , (standard deviation (SD) 1.9kg/m 2 ) and nearly 40% of all participants were current smokers. Duration of HIV infection ranged between 24 weeks and 16 years. Ten studies[ 9 , 13 – 20 ] included only participants on ART and three studies included only ART naïve participants.[ 11 , 12 , 21 ]  CAC score was used as endpoint in 13 studies,[ 6 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 22 – 30 ] in seven of which a coronary angiography was performed as well.[ 6 , 22 – 27 ] Five studies used other imaging techniques to assess cardiovascular burden; two studies used 18FDG PET scan[ 30 , 31 ], two used a myocardial perfusion scintigraphy[ 19 , 32 ] and one used an MRI scan of aortic and carotid arteries[ 33 ]. Arterial stiffness was assessed in 13 studies[ 9 – 12 , 15 – 18 , 20 , 21 , 34 – 36 ]; 10 studies used FMD[ 9 – 12 , 15 – 17 , 20 , 21 , 34 ], two PWV[ 10 , 20 ], one PWA[ 18 ], one ABI[ 35 ] and one used carotid artery stiffness[ 36 ].    Critical appraisal  All studies were critically appraised on eight items; clarity of inclusion criteria; moment of inclusion; standardization of measurement of determinant and outcome; missing data at baseline or follow-up; missing data on potential eligible participants; and blinding and adjustment for confounders ( S2 Table ). A risk of bias summary is presented in Fig 2 . The criterion ‘homogeneous moment of inclusion’ is not incorporated in the figure, since it could not be categorized as ‘likely’ or ‘unlikely’ due to the different aspects that were covered. Risk of bias was low in general, except for the missed potential eligible participants. Although most studies had a standardized procedure for measuring immune markers and outcomes, these procedures were different between studies.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169986.g002  Fig 2   Risk of bias assessment.       Overall outcome  Fig 3 provides an overview of the number of studies that assessed any immune marker in relation to the surrogate CVD outcomes. CRP, IL-6 and sVCAM-1 were assessed most frequently. None of the markers were clearly associated with surrogate markers of CVD. Only CRP and sCD163 were at least three times positively associated: CRP 5 times (out of 26 studies),[ 10 , 13 , 18 , 22 , 29 ] of which three times in univariable analysis,[ 13 , 22 , 29 ] sCD163 three times (out of 7 studies),[ 6 , 27 , 30 ] of which two times in univariable analysis.[ 6 , 30 ]   10.1371/journal.pone.0169986.g003  Fig 3   Association of immune markers with surrogate CVD outcomes.  CVD: cardiovascular disease.       Imaging   CT coronary angiography and coronary calcium score  Six Smarkers were evaluated three or more times in relation to coronary calcium score or coronary angiography ( Fig 4A ). CRP was assessed 10 times,[ 6 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 22 – 26 , 29 ] of which two studies showed a significant, but weak correlation with severity of obstruction on angiography (Rho 0.29, p 0.038)[ 22 ] and with CAC (Rho value 0.16, p 0.003)[ 29 ]. sCD163 was positively related in three out of five studies; two times to non-calcified plaque[ 6 , 23 ] and one time to coronary calcium score and coronary artery stenosis of more than 50%.[ 27 ] However, the association with non-calcified plaque disappeared in multivariable analysis in one out of two studies.[ 6 ] sCD14 showed a significant association in two out of five studies. A high level of sCD14 compared to a low level of sCD14 was associated with an odds ratio of 3.3 (95% CI 1.1–9.7) for coronary artery stenosis,[ 27 ] and levels of sCD14 were related to the presence of coronary artery calcium in multivariable analysis.[ 13 ] MCP-1 was borderline significantly related to severity of plaque (Rho value 0.23, p 0.047) and weakly related to the Agatston Calcium score (Rho value 0.27, p 0.02) in one study.[ 26 ]   10.1371/journal.pone.0169986.g004  Fig 4   Association of immune markers with coronary angiography, coronary calcium score and arterial stiffness.       Other imaging techniques  CRP was assessed in four studies using 18FDG PET scan[ 30 , 31 ] or SPECT scan as outcome[ 19 , 32 ]; no study showed a significant association. None of the other markers were assessed more than three times. sCD163 was assessed twice in relation to PET scan outcomes, both studies showed a significant association (association with FDG uptake in the descending aorta Rho value -0.517, p 0.007] and with Target Background Ration, Rho value 0.31, p 0.04).[ 30 ]     Arterial stiffness measurement  Six markers were evaluated three times or more in relation to arterial stiffness ( Fig 4B ). CRP was positively associated with PWV in multivariate analysis (parameter estimate 0.0209, p 0.01),[ 10 ] and mean levels of CRP were significantly higher in individuals with definite peripheral artery disease compared to participants with normal ABI (8.5 versus 7.2 mg/L).[ 11 , 12 , 35 ] Levels of IL-6 corresponded with the lowest quartile of FMD (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01–1.35, p 0.04) and IL-6 was the best predictor of FMD in a multivariable linear model.[ 16 ] On the other hand, Stein et al[ 21 ] found an inverse relation in univariate analysis; higher IL-6 levels were associated with higher FMD (indicative of a lower CVD risk) and lower levels of IL-6 were associated with increase in brachial diameter (indicative of a higher CVD risk). None of the other markers were significantly associated with arterial stiffness. Three studies using FMD as outcome included only ART naïve individuals.[ 11 , 12 , 21 ] No association with CRP was found (assessed in all three studies), and associations with IL-6 (assessed in two studies) showed contradictory results.    Composite endpoint for vascular disease  Longenecker et al.[ 13 ] used a composite endpoint for vascular disease consisting of CAC score >0, endothelial dysfunction according to FMD and carotid disease. They found that CRP, sCD14 and fibrinogen were all significantly associated with vascular disease.[ 13 ]     Discussion  A large number of immune markers have been investigated for predictive value in relation to surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease in HIV positive patients. CRP, IL-6 and sVCAM-1 were addressed most frequently; neither CRP, IL-6, sVCAM-1 nor any of the other markers showed a clear relation with any of the surrogate CVD markers.  These results complement the findings of a recent review assessing immune marker choice in relation to CVD or CIMT. CRP, IL-6 and s-VCAM-1 were also the most frequently assessed markers in relation to CIMT, and the lack of a clear relation between any of these immune markers and surrogate CVD outcomes that is currently found is in line with the findings in relation to CIMT.[ 7 ]  Although there is ample evidence that levels of CRP[ 37 , 38 ] and IL-6[ 39 , 40 ] are related to CVD both in the general population as well as in the HIV-infected population,[ 5 , 41 – 43 ] the current review does not indicate any consistent relation of CRP and IL-6 to coronary calcium score, coronary stenosis, SPECT, 18FDG PET scan or measurements of arterial stiffness.  Although the prognostic role of s-VCAM-1 levels in the prediction of CVD in not as clear, an association with signs of endothelial damage (FMD, PWV) or inflammation (MRI, PET) was to be expected as s-VCAM-1 is expressed on the endothelial surface in case of endothelial inflammation.[ 44 ] However, no single positive association with any of the surrogate CVD outcomes was detected in this review.  The two possible explanations why this review did not show an association between any of the markers and surrogate CVD outcomes could be that either there is no association, or associations are not yet clear due to methodological and qualitative constraints in the available evidence.  The first explanation, no association, could be due to the fact that, despite surrogate outcomes and overt CVD being clearly related,[ 45 – 53 ] and CRP, IL-6 and overt CVD having a clear relation, associations between markers of immune activation and surrogate markers of CVD may be weak.  The second explanation, lack of an association due to methodological and qualitative constraints, could be due to a marked heterogeneity in choice of both immune markers, surrogate outcomes and ways of analysis (effect estimates vary from correlations, mean markers levels, odds ratio’s and multivariable analysis). In addition, studies were not primarily designed or powered to detect an association between immune markers and outcome and study designs were mainly cross-sectional (27 out of 29 studies). Follow-up time of the two prospective studies was too short to detect significant vascular alterations and all studies included a relatively young population (average age 45 years), in which atherosclerotic vascular changes and–burden are expected to be low.  Finally, possible associations might be masked by heterogeneity in patient populations, duration of HIV diagnosis, use and duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART), viral suppression rates and CD4 counts, as they differ substantially in, and between, studies. All these factors have been previously reported to influence both the inflammatory response and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[ 53 – 55 ] Moreover, statin use is not taken into account in most of the included studies, whereas recent evidence suggests that statin use can improve surrogate cardiovascular outcomes.[ 56 , 57 ]   Strengths and limitations  This systematic review synthesizes the available information on immune-markers in relation to surrogate markers of CVD (except CIMT) in HIV-infected patients from 1996 up to April 2015. The main focus of this review was to provide an overview of which immune markers were assessed, how frequently these markers were assessed and which surrogate CVD outcomes were chosen, as well as to summarize the current evidence on the relation between immune markers and outcomes.  The most frequently assessed immune markers (CRP and IL-6) have been shown to be related to CVD morbidity and mortality in both the general population and in the HIV-infected population, and surrogate CVD outcomes have been shown to be related to CVD in the general population. This is the first time that the relation between immune markers and surrogate CVD outcomes is addressed in a systematic way in the context of HIV infection. The major strength of this review is that it contributes to a clear, global understanding of existing knowledge regarding immune markers and surrogate CVD outcomes.  Limitations to be considered include that only one outcome per marker per article was considered which might have resulted in an overly optimistic impression of associations as negative outcomes are underreported; that positive outcomes include univariable associations which might in part be confounded; and that outcomes were grouped in categories (CT-angiography/CAC, other imaging techniques and arterial stiffness) which might have resulted in specific associations (to specific parts of an outcome) being overlooked.     Conclusion  This review provides an overview of the current literature regarding the association between immune markers and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease other than CIMT in HIV-positive individuals. Most frequently assessed immune markers were CRP, IL-6 and s-VCAM-1; most frequently assessed surrogate markers for CVD were CAC and FMD.  No relation between any of the immune markers and any of the surrogate outcomes could be detected. This may be due to the cross-sectional design, heterogeneity in patient populations, the variety in immune marker choice and surrogate CVD outcomes. The search for the association of immune markers in relation to surrogate CVD outcomes in a cross-sectional study design should be reconsidered.  Future research should focus on longitudinal studies measuring immune markers and surrogate CVD outcomes awaiting the primary outcome of clinical cardiovascular events.

The clinical demand on rapid microbiological diagnostic is constantly increasing. PCR coupled to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, PCR/ESI-MS, offers detection and identification of over 750 bacteria and Candida species directly from clinical specimens within 6 hours. In this study, we investigated the clinical performance of the IRIDICA BAC LRT Assay for detection of bacterial pathogens in 121 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples that were received consecutively at our bacterial laboratory for BAL culture. Commensal or pathogenic microorganisms were detected in 118/121 (98%) BAL samples by PCR/ESI-MS, while in 104/121 (86%) samples by routine culture ( P <0.01). Detection of potentially pathogenic microorganisms by PCR/ESI-MS was evaluated in comparison with conventional culture-based or molecular methods. The agreement between positive findings was overall good. Most Staphylococcus aureus -positive PCR/ESI-MS results were confirmed by culture or species-specific PCR (27/33, 82%). The identity of Streptococcus pneumoniae could however be confirmed for only 6/17 (35%) PCR/ESI-MS-positive samples. Non-cultivable and fastidious pathogens, which were not covered by standard culture procedures were readily detected by PCR/ESI-MS, including Legionella pneumophila , Bordetella pertussis , Norcadia species and Mycoplasma pneumoniae . In conclusion, PCR/ESI-MS detected a broad range of potential pathogens with equal or superior sensitivity compared to conventional methods within few hours directly from BAL samples. This novel method might thus provide a relevant tool for diagnostics in critically ill patients.    Abbott provided an IRIDICA PCR/ESI-MS instrument and IRIDICA test kits for the study. However, Abbott had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. The authors received no specific financial funding for this work.

Early optimal antimicrobial treatment is linked to improved patient outcome, reduced risk for resistance development and adverse side effects by the antimicrobials [ 3 ]. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial pathogen isolated from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), a large proportion of CAP is caused by other pathogens, with considerable geographical variations [ 4 , 5 ]. In contrast, Gram-negative species and Staphylococcus aureus dominate among bacteria isolated from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [ 6 , 7 ]. The wide range of possible pathogens challenge the development of methods for rapid detection and identification, needed to ensure timely appropriate antimicrobial therapy.  Conventional culture-based investigation of LRT secretions is currently the method of choice for detection of bacterial pathogens in critically ill patients with suspected pneumonia [ 3 , 8 ]. Culture-based approaches however often fail in detecting a causative agent. Prior antimicrobial therapy decreases the sensitivity of methods based on bacterial viability [ 9 , 10 ], and certain pathogens are generally not cultivable with standard methods. In addition, these methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. During the recent years, novel culture-independent techniques have been proposed as promising alternatives for detection and identification of pathogens from severe pneumonia. Different to samples from sterile body sites, commensal and colonizing microorganisms complicate the analysis in LRT secretions. While multiplex PCR assays have short turn-around times and are suited for detection of multiple pathogens simultaneously, the target panel is limited and information regarding commensal microorganisms is generally lacking. Diagnostic PCR-kits designed for sepsis diagnosis, e.g. LightCycler SeptiFast from Roche Diagnostics [ 11 ] have broader coverage but lack important respiratory pathogens. Similarly, poor performance and insufficient coverage has been reported for the Unyvero multiplex PCR device (Curetis AG) for direct point-of-care detection of respiratory pathogens [ 12 , 13 ]. Assays such as the RB5 Anyplex II kit (Seegene) are designed for detection of few atypical bacterial pathogens only. There is thus an obvious need for a rapid method covering both common and atypical microorganisms directly from LRT specimens.  PCR/ESI-MS overcomes these limitations by combining multiple broad range PCR reactions with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS), which rapidly provides sequence information from the generated amplicons [ 14 ]. Subsequent bioinformatical analysis with an integrated database enables identification of species and resistance determinants. An internal calibrant molecule in each PCR reaction permits semi-quantitation of the detected genomes. The first PCR/ESI-MS version for clinical research, the Ibis T5000 universal biosensor platform (Ibis Biosciences, an Abbott company), used an assay kit for identification of over 600 bacteria and Candida species. Evaluation of this assay on brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples showed however suboptimal performance, with a concordance to standard culture-based methods of 66% for detection of bacterial pathogens [ 15 ]. Further development led to the PLEX-ID instrument (Abbott). The concordance rate of this analysis with conventional methods was 77% for detection of bacterial pathogens and 45% when microorganisms from the normal flora were included [ 16 ]. It should be noted that the applied assay was intended for use in sterile fluids and not BAL. A re-designed, research-use-only version of the instrument was recently tested in LRT secretions. This study demonstrated the improved detection of bacterial pathogens in patients under antibiotic treatment with 49/104 (47%) hits in culture-negative samples [ 17 ]. However, the study considered only primary detections for evaluation and performance on polymicrobial samples was neglected.  The lack of a gold standard method hampers evaluation of discrepant findings originated from conventional culture-dependent methods and PCR/ESI-MS. In the hitherto published studies, detections from PCR/ESI-MS were not systematically confirmed by complementing methods when culture results were missing. This situation makes it extremely difficult to interpret the quality of the PCR/ESI-MS results reported previously.  In November 2014, a PCR/ESI-MS platform was CE-marked and became commercially available with the product name IRIDICA. The aim of the present study was to evaluate its performance in detection of respiratory pathogens in clinical BAL samples, using the IRIDICA BAC LRT Assay (Ibis Biosciences, Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL). Discrepant results for selected bacterial species were further analyzed with species-specific or broad range-PCR. As the IRIDCA BAC LRT Assay occasionally reported “Fungus no ID”, we also aimed to study if such result was linked to any positive fungal culture results.    Materials and Methods   Study material  All BAL samples included in this study ( n = 121) were part of standard hospital care and taken as per routine practice. Median age of the patients was 60 years (range 0–90 years) and the majority was male (83/121, 69%). Most samples were collected at the clinic for pulmonary diseases/allergy (72/121, 60%), intensive care units, hematology or transplantation (29/121, 24%), or at the clinic for infectious diseases (12/121, 10%). Consecutive BAL samples sent to the Division of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Laboratory Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden, for standard microbiological diagnostic between May 2014 and March 2015 were subjected to routine culture-based diagnostic and the remaining samples was stored at -20°C for subsequent analysis by PCR/ESI-MS.    IRIDICA PCR/ESI-MS  Bacterial and Candida DNA was detected and semi-quantified using the IRIDICA BAC LRT Assay (Abbott), designed to detect 780 bacterial and Candida species and four antibiotic resistance markers, mecA , vanA / vanB and blaKPC . For a defined panel of non- Candida fungal DNA, the assay reports “Fungus detected—No ID can be provided”. The analysis requires approximately six hours, and up to six samples including a negative control can be run simultaneously. From each sample, an aliquot of 100 μl BAL was analyzed. Samples were processed according to the manufacturer’s recommendation, including mechanical and chemical lysis; extraction of DNA followed by PCR, using 18 primer pairs in 16-well pre-coated PCR strips; desalting and purification of the amplicons; and analysis by ESI-MS. Species identification was achieved by bioinformatical analysis with an integrated software and database. Quantitation of detected genomes was based on internal calibrant molecules in each reaction and was reported as a semi-quantitative “level” for each detection.    Lower detection limit for Staphylococcus aureus by PCR/ESI-MS  The methicillin-resistant S . aureus (MRSA) strain CCUG 31966 was used to establish the lower detection level PCR/ESI-MS using the IRIDICA BAC LRT Assay for this species as well as for the mecA resistance determinant. Bacterial colonies were suspended in PBS to a McFarland 0.5. A 10-fold dilution series was prepared in PBS and dilutions 10 −3 , 10 −4 , 10 −5 and 10 −6 were analyzed in 4–6 replicates. The dilution, for which both S . aureus and mecA was detected in all runs was regarded as limit for reliable detection (lower detection limit).    Routine culture-based microbiological diagnostics  A quantitative culture technique was employed for routine culture-based analysis of the clinical samples. This included aerobic and anaerobic culture on non-selective agar (blood agar); a crystal violet-containing blood agar plate with an optochin disc at 5% CO 2 for selection and identification of S . pneumoniae ; a chocolate agar plate with an oleandomycin disc at 5% CO 2 for selection and identification of Haemophilus influenzae ; and a cysteine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient (CLED) agar plate for identification of Enterobacteriaceae. All agar plates were inoculated with 10 μl BAL each and were incubated for a total of 2 days at 37°C. The lower limit of detection was 100 CFU/ml, and growth of >10 4 CFU/ml was regarded significant. Primary respiratory pathogens were reported regardless of quantity, while potential pathogens, colonizers or contaminants were reported when dominating and/or present in significant quantities. Relevant microorganisms were identified by MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonik) or the Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux). A confidence score ≥2.0 or a probability score >93% were considered reliable species identification by MALDI-TOF MS or Vitek 2, respectively, as recommended by the manufacturers. Complementing analyses were carried out when indicated. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion according to EUCAST standards (EUCAST, http://www.eucast.org/ ). For verification of results from PCR/ESI-MS, results from related patient samples were recorded if available, including results from routine fungal culture.    Definition of normal respiratory flora  Following bacterial species were in general regarded as part of the normal respiratory flora: α-hemolytic streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus species, Neisseria species, Rothia species, Corynebacterium species and Candida species. Growth of these species was usually summarized and reported as “normal respiratory flora” from routine microbiological diagnostics.    Verification of detections and species identification  Selected samples were analyzed for the presence of S . aureus and S . pneumonia by PCR targeting the nuc or lytA gene, respectively. DNA was extracted from a 500-μl aliquot of BAL using the MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit III (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR for lytA was performed on a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics) as described [ 18 ]; PCR for nuc was performed according to a previously described protocol [ 19 ] but adopted to the Rotorgene Q system (Qiagen) using 0.3 μM of each primer. The presence of other pathogens was verified by standard diagnostic PCR assay targeting respiratory tract pathogens (RB5 Anyplex II, Seegene; detecting Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydophila pneumoniae , Legionella pneumophila , Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis ), or by 16S rRNA sequencing.    Statistical analysis  Differences were evaluated by the Mann Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate, categorical results were compared using Fisher’s exact test. P -values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.    Ethics statement  This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. An ethical permission was not required since the samples were anonymized an deidentified before being obtained by the authors.     Results   PCR/ESI-MS detects overall more microorganisms than routine culture  A total of 245 microorganisms were detected by PCR/ESI-MS in 118/121 (98%) BAL samples included in the study ( Fig 1 ). The microorganisms belonged to 60 different species, with 18 species regarded as primary or potential pathogens (referred to as pathogens hereafter, Table 1 ) for LRT infections. The remaining 42 species were considered part of the normal respiratory flora, colonizers or contaminants ( Table 2 ). Pathogens were detected in 86/121 (71%) BAL samples, with two different pathogenic species in 15/86 (17%) samples. No detection was made 3/121 (2%) BAL samples. In contrast, “no growth” was reported for 17/121 (14%) samples after routine culture ( P <0.01).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170033.g001  Fig 1   Detection of multiple microorganisms in bronchoalveolar lavage samples by PCR/ESI-MS.

Performance of PCR/ESI-MS for detection of Staphylococcus aureus  S . aureus was among the most frequently detected potential pathogen, with 33 positive samples by PCR/ESI-MS. S . aureus was reported for 15/33 (45%) samples from routine culture, indicating dominating growth and significant numbers of colonies. Interestingly, semi-quantitative PCR/ESI-MS levels for S . aureus -specific DNA were significantly higher for these 15 specimens ( Fig 2 ). Dose-response experiments with spiked samples defined a concentration of approximately 0.4×10 4 CFU/ml as lower level for detection of this species, corresponding to PCR/ESI-MS levels of 35±6.9. All 15 samples with significant growth of S . aureus yielded levels above this threshold. In 12/18 (67%) culture-negative samples, detection of S . aureus by PCR/ESI-MS was confirmed by species-specific PCR. Five of the six remaining samples were tested negative by PCR; one was not available for further investigation. Together, the presence of S . aureus was verified by culture and/or PCR in 27/33 (82%) PCR/ESI-MS-positive samples. Among the studied material, there were no PCR/ESI-MS-negative samples with recorded growth of S . aureus .   10.1371/journal.pone.0170033.g002  Fig 2   Semi-quantitative detection of Staphylococcus aureus by PCR/ESI-MS.  S . aureus was detected in a total of 33 bronchoalveolar lavage samples. In 27 samples, the results were confirmed by culture ( n = 15) or PCR for nuc ( n = 12). Individual values with median are shown, comparison was made by Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test; * P <0.05, ** P <0.01. The dashed line indicates the mean level for the lower detection limit of S . aureus by PCR/ESI-MS (0.4×10 4 CFU/ml), the open square indicates a sample not available for confirming tests.       Performance of PCR/ESI-MS for detection of streptococcus pneumoniae  S . pneumoniae was detected in 17 BAL samples by PCR/ESI-MS. The presence of S . pneumoniae was however confirmed in only 6/17 (35%) samples, in two by positive culture and in another four samples by species-specific PCR ( Fig 3 ). Semi-quantitative PCR/ESI-MS levels did not significantly differ between lytA -positive and lytA -negative samples ( P = 0.35). High PCR/ESI-MS levels were however obtained for the two samples which were both lytA - and culture-positive. In addition, the C T -values for lytA indicated higher levels of the pathogen for culture-positive compared to culture-negative samples and overall, values correlated with semi-quantitative levels from the PCR/ESI-MS analysis ( S1 Fig ). Three culture-positive samples did not yield positive results for S . pneumoniae or any other streptococcal species by PCR/ESI-MS.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170033.g003  Fig 3   Detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae with PCR/ESI-MS.  S . pneumoniae was detected in a total of 17 bronchoalveolar lavage samples. In 6 samples, the results were confirmed by PCR for lytA . Individual values with median are shown, the squares indicate culture-positive samples.       Detection of haemophilus influenza  Detection of H . influenzae by PCR/ESI-MS was confirmed by culture in 16/20 (80%) BAL samples ( Table 1 ). Semi-quantitative PCR/ESI-MS levels for 3/4 culture-negative samples were low or moderate ( S2 Fig ). Interestingly, two of these patients had been culture-positive for H . influenzae two weeks before the study sample was taken. Heavy growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae might have obscured the presence of H . influenzae in the fourth sample which yielded high PCR/ESI-MS levels ( Table 3 ). Similarly, CFU levels were significantly higher in samples with positive result by PCR/ESI-MS, while sparse growth of H . influenzae was detected in three PCR/ESI-MS-negative samples ( Table 3 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170033.t003  Table 3  Data for patients with discrepant results with respect to respiratory pathogens obtained by PCR/ESI-MS and routine culture-based analysis.

PCR/ESI-MS allows detection of non-cultivable and fastidious pathogens  In four BAL samples, atypical pathogens were detected which were not covered by the routine culture-based method, namely Legionella pneumophila , Bordetella pertussis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Nocardia species. The detection of these microorganisms was confirmed by other methods in the identical or in related patient samples ( Table 1 ).    Resistance determinants mecA , vanA and vanB and blaKPC  The methicillin resistance-determinant mecA was detected in 21/121 (17%) BAL samples. Only 8/21 (38%) of these samples were also positive for S . aureus , indicating the potential presence of methicillin-resistant S . aureus (MRSA). Dose-response experiments showed that PCR/ESI-MS levels for S . aureus and the mecA gene were of similar range. An overall correlation between mecA and S . aureus -specific signals in these eight samples could however not been established, suggesting other origin of the mecA in at least part of the samples. Moreover, MRSA was not detected in any of the samples by culture, and significant growth of S . aureus was only reported for one sample. In one patient with high mecA -specific PCR/ESI-MS levels, however, a MRSA was isolated from another respiratory sample. Of the remaining mecA -positive samples, 12/13 displayed high PCR/ESI-MS levels (>100), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in all of them, suggesting an associated of mecA to a none- S . aureus staphylococcal species.  There was no BAL sample that was vanA / vanB -positive. Similarly, no carbapenem-resistant or blaKPC -positive BAL sample was detected in the studied material.    Report of fungal DNA without identification  While the BAC LRT Assay identifies Candida to genus level and eight Candida species furthermore to species level, a large panel of fungal DNA can be detected but not species-identified. The assay is moreover not designed for detection of fungi. However, for seven samples, the presence of fungal DNA was reported. Six of these samples were also sent for routine fungal diagnostics. In five of them, growth of fungi other than Candida was detected, including Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus versicolor , Penicillium species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trichosporon ashii .     Discussion  PCR/ESI-MS is one of the most recent methods developed for detection and identification of microorganisms and selected resistance markers directly from clinical specimens. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the analytical performance of the PCR/ESI-MS platform IRIDICA in identification of microorganisms from BAL samples.  PCR/ESI-MS could identify 60 different microorganisms in 121 BAL samples and demonstrated an overall higher sensitivity compared to routine culture-based microbiological diagnostics, with identification of microorganisms in 15/17 (88%) culture-negative samples. In only one PCR/ESI-MS-negative sample, growth of normal respiratory flora was reported. Detailed microbiological diagnostics of BAL samples may be valuable information to the clinician depending on the clinical status of the patient.  When the analytical performance of PCR/ESI-MS in detection of primary or potential pathogens was analyzed, we found that the method in general was not inferior to culture-based methods in detection of these microorganisms. The vast majority of pathogens detected by culture, 52/60 (87%), could be detected by PCR/ESI-MS.  Identification of S . pneumoniae and differentiation from other α-hemolytic streptococci is notoriously difficult [ 20 , 21 ]. Among the sample material investigated in this study, only 6/17 (35%) detections of S . pneumoniae were confirmed by culture or additional molecular analysis. In contrast, S . pneumoniae could not be identified in three samples with positive culture results. Interestingly, multiple matches were reported for the two samples with positive culture results, specified as Streptococcus mitis/pneumoniae and S . pneumoniae . This result was not displayed for any of the culture-negative samples. The present data indicates that PCR/ESI-MS has limited specificity and sensitivity in detection of S . pneumoniae . The low number of clinical isolates detected in BAL cultures does however not allow solid conclusions and further studies are needed. Based on the findings presented here, other tests complementary to PCR/ESI-MS are recommended to determine the presence or absence of S . pneumoniae if clinically indicated.  We experienced a similar problem in identification of Moraxella catarrhalis , which was reported as Moraxella catarrhalis/nonliquefaciens belonging to the normal flora. Problems to differentiate the two Moraxella species by molecular methods have previously been reported and been related to limited genomic sequence data for design of specific primers [ 13 ].  While all detected microorganisms are reported as positive finding by PCR/ESI-MS, culture reports include some degree of evaluation by a clinical microbiologist. Based on a low number of colonies or the presence of other fast-growing microorganisms, opportunistic or slow-growing pathogens might not be reported. This may explain the majority of the discrepancies observed for detection of S . aureus , a colonizer of the upper respiratory tract in up to 30% of adults [ 22 , 23 ]. Samples with S . aureus -negative culture reports yielded overall significantly lower PCR/ESI-MS levels. Moreover, bacteria belonging to the normal flora were detected in 12/18 (67%) of these low-levels samples, but only in 4/15 (27%) samples, for which S . aureus was considered relevant by culture ( P <0.05). These observations allow the suggestion that most discrepancies between culture reports and PCR/ESI-MS results are based on clinical interpretation of culture results rather than on false-positive reactions by PCR/ESI-MS. The present data also suggests that semi-quantitative levels and co-detection of commensal flora are relevant information for clinical interpretation of results from PCR/ESI-MS, in particular with respect to detection of S . aureus . PCR/ESI-MS results from BAL samples should thus be interpreted similarly to culture results. Microorganisms that are regarded as normal respiratory flora in BAL culture should reasonably be indicated as being part of the normal respiratory flora even when reporting results from PCR/ESI-MS on BAL.  In the present study, we were able to detect non-cultivable and fastidious pathogens with PCR/ESI-MS, i.e. L . pneumophila , M . pneumonia , Nocardia species and B . pertussis , which were overlooked by routine standard culture. Rapid detection of atypical pathogens from BAL samples by PCR/ESI-MS might be important in the clinical routine.  In addition, detection of fungal DNA by PCR/ESI-MS proved to be a reliable indication for the presence of non- Candida fungal species. Although no identification can be provided by the IRIDICA BAC LRT Assay, detection of fungal DNA in a sample may suggest that fungal-specific investigation is indicated and that antifungal treatment could be considered. It should however be noted that the IRIDICA BAC LRT Assay is not designed for detection of fungal species other than Candida and sensitivity for detection of molds by this assay has not been studied.  The IRIDCA BAC LRT Assay panel also includes selected major resistance determinants, i.e. mecA , vanA , vanB , and blaKPC . The only gene detected in the samples investigated here was mecA . In Sweden, only 1–3% of S . aureus from bloodstream infections are currently mecA -positive ( http://ecdc.europa.eu ) [ 24 , 25 ]. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are however commonly detected as part of the normal flora or contaminant, and are frequently positive for mecA . In regions with relatively low prevalence of MRSA, the detection of mecA without physical linkage to a S . aureus isolate is thus of no diagnostic value in this kind of sample.  One of the limitations of the present study is the lack of clinical data. The clinical value of a comprehensive microbiological response to the clinicians could therefore not be assessed. In addition, the analysis was performed on consecutive BAL samples. In clinical practice however, samples from only a selected group of patients will be chosen for analysis by PCR/ESI-MS. The array of pathogens might thus probably differ and influence the overall performance of PCR/ESI-MS. A recent study on BAL samples from mechanically ventilated patients [ 26 ] indicated promising clinical performance of PCR/ESI-MS in comparison with other microbiological diagnostic approaches.  In conclusion, our study demonstrates overall reliable detection of respiratory pathogens by PCR/ESI-MS directly from BAL samples. PCR/ESI-MS thus provides an interestingly tool for the rapid detection of a wide range of pathogens from polymicrobial samples. This might be especially interesting for critically ill patients undergoing antimicrobial therapy at the time of sampling. Studies including clinical data are warranted to improve interpretation of the data.

Rationale  The E2F pathway plays a critical role in cardiac growth and development, yet its role in cardiac metabolism remains to be defined. Metabolic changes play important roles in human heart failure and studies imply the ketogenic enzyme β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase I (BDH1) is a potential biomarker.    Objective  To define the role of the E2F pathway in cardiac metabolism and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with a focus on BDH1.    Methods and Results  We previously developed transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the transcriptional repressor, E2F6, to interfere with the E2F/Rb pathway in post-natal myocardium. These Tg mice present with an E2F6 dose dependent DCM and deregulated connexin-43 (CX-43) levels in myocardium. Using the Seahorse platform, a 22% decrease in glycolysis was noted in neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from E2F6-Tg hearts. This was associated with a 39% reduction in the glucose transporter GLUT4 and 50% less activation of the regulator of glucose metabolism AKT2. The specific reduction of cyclin B1 (70%) in Tg myocardium implicates its importance in supporting glycolysis in the postnatal heart. No changes in cyclin D expression (known to regulate mitochondrial activity) were noted and lipid metabolism remained unchanged in neonatal cardiomyocytes from Tg hearts. However, E2F6 induced a 40-fold increase of the Bdh1 transcript and 890% increase in its protein levels in hearts from Tg pups implying a potential impact on ketolysis. By contrast, BDH1 expression is not activated until adulthood in normal myocardium. Neonatal cardiomyocytes from Wt hearts incubated with the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) showed a 100% increase in CX-43 protein levels, implying a role for ketone signaling in gap junction biology. Neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures from Tg hearts exhibited enhanced levels of BDH1 and CX-43 and were not responsive to β-OHB.    Conclusions  The data reveal a novel role for the E2F pathway in regulating glycolysis in the developing myocardium through a mechanism involving cyclin B1. We reveal BDH1 expression as an early biomarker of heart failure and its potential impact, through ketone signaling, on CX-43 levels in E2F6-induced DCM.        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004411  Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada    540033   Balwant S.

Given the extensive energy requirements of the heart, and its limited ATP reserve, understanding the mechanisms which regulate cardiac metabolism is critical to the understanding of heart function and failure [ 3 , 4 ]. In the normal adult heart, fatty acid oxidation accounts for up to 90% of the ATP production while glycolysis supplies the remainder [ 5 ]. The heart shows a remarkable capacity to adapt to substrate utilization under stress. In the failing heart, a reduction of fatty acid oxidation and changes in glycolysis are observed [ 5 , 6 ]. It was recently demonstrated that there is an increase in ketone metabolism and the ketogenic enzyme, β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1), in human and mouse heart failure [ 7 – 10 ].  Ketones are synthesized in the liver and exist in three main forms: β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) the most stable and abundant form, acetoacetate, and acetone [ 11 ]. Ketone bodies arise from the incomplete oxidation of long chain fatty acids. They are utilized as an alternative energy source when glucose is scarce, such as during fasting, exercise, and in many disease states such as diabetes [ 11 , 12 ]. Glucose is a vital nutrient source in the developing heart and during heart failure, thus ketones could be an important alternative energy source during metabolic stress [ 1 ]. It is therefore critical to understand how the heart uses ketones to adapt to substrate utilization during cardiac development and disease.  The E2F family is a group of nine transcription factors which regulate cell proliferation, hypertrophy, and death [ 13 , 14 ]. Recently, the transcriptional activator, E2F1, has been demonstrated to promote glycolysis via regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK4) and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACS) to regulate metabolism [ 15 – 18 ]. In association with its modulator, Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), E2F1 can also repress oxidative phosphorylation[ 19 , 20 ]. E2F6 is a unique E2F family member which is believed to repress E2F responsive genes independently of Rb [ 21 , 22 ] (Gaubatz, Wood, & Livingston, 1998; Trimarchi, Fairchild, Wen, & Lees, 2001) . We previously examined the contribution of the E2F pathway in post-natal mouse myocardium by cardiac specific expression of E2F6 which led to the early-onset of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without hypertrophy or apoptosis [ 23 , 24 ]. Contrary to expectation, E2F6-Tg mice showed activation of E2F responsive genes [ 23 ]. This was achieved via down-regulation of E2F3 (critical for cardiac development) [ 23 , 25 ]and competitive binding at E2F sites which are normally repressed via E2F/Rb in the post-natal heart[ 26 , 27 , 21 ]. In essence, E2F6 serves as a dominant negative of E2F/Rb in the heart.  E2F6-Tg mice display an early reduction in connexin-43(CX-43) and reduced conductivity which is a hallmark of DCM and heart failure[ 25 ]. Here we further examine the changes in the post-natal myocardium of E2F6-Tg mice with the view to define early bio-markers and novel pathways which may be useful for understanding and treating idiopathic DCM. We note the early induction of BDH1 in neonatal Tg myocardium and a relationship between ketones and CX-43 expression in cardiomyocytes. We further note that deregulation of the E2F pathway impairs glycolysis which may have triggered the induction of BDH1 and the resulting changes in CX-43 leading to DCM.    Methods   Mice and Genotyping  Previously described Tg mice with cardiac specific expression of E2F6 (under control of the α-Myosin heavy chain promoter) (B6C3F1) were bred with WT (B6C3F1) mice [ 23 , 24 ]. All animal work was conducted according to the University of Ottawa’s institutional animal care committee guidelines. The protocols were approved by the University of Ottawa's institutional animal care committee: cmm-1725, cmm-1723. All possible steps were taken to ameliorate animal suffering. Mouse pups were euthanized by decapitation. Adult mice were euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation. Approximately 110 mice were used in this study. This number was required in order to obtain sufficient sample size for appropriate biochemical and statistical analyses.  Genotyping was performed via DNA extraction from mouse ear (adult) or tail (pup) clip and PCR using the Phire Tissue Direct (Thermo Scientific) kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers spanning the 6 th intron of E2F6 were used ( ATCACAGTACATATTAGGAGCAC - sense, and GGTGCGGCTACCAGTCTACA –anti-sense) which result in the amplification of a long fragment (988bp) in Wt mice and a long and short fragment (342bp) in Tg mice which were separated on a 1.3% agarose gel.    RNA Analyses  RNA was extracted from cardiac lysate at post-natal day 7 using the RNEasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2μg RNA and oligoDT with SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. qPCR was performed in the q-Rotor (Qiagen) using Fast Start SYBR Green (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression was normalized against Gapdh , and fold inductions were calculated using the ΔΔ C t method. Primer pairs used for qPCR are: Bdh1 : AAGCACTGGAAGCAGACACAT (sense), ACACTTAGGGCTTTTCCTGGG (anti-sense), Oxct1 : CTGGAGTTTGAGGACGGCAT (sense), TCCGCATCAGCTTCGTCTTT (anti-sense), GLUT4 : GCAGATCGGCTCTGACGATG (sense), GCCACGTTGCATTGTAGCTC (anti-sense), and Gapdh : GCAGTGGCAAAGTGGAGATT (sense) and TCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGACA (anti-sense).    Western Blot  Neonatal cardiomyocytes were rinsed twice with PBS and frozen at -80°C. Plates were thawed on ice in RIPA (50mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1mM EDTA, 150μM NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% NP-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Plates were scraped and lysates were syringed with a 21G needle. Cardiac lysates were prepared with an electric tissue homogenizer in RIPA with protease and phosphatase inhibitors.  Cardiac and cell lysates were centrifuged at 12800g for 10min at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Lysates (13-50ug) were run on gradient (5–15%) SDS-PAGE gels in 3X loading dye (Cell Signaling). Gels were transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore) in transfer buffer (25mM Tris, 190mM Glycine, 20% methanol) overnight at 4°C. Membranes were blocked in TBST (1M Tris, 290mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween, pH7.2) with 5% milk. The blots were probed with primary and secondary antibodies (listed below) which were diluted in TBST with 5% milk. The conversion of ECL substrate (Roche) was detected on film. Band signal intensities were quantified by densitometry using Image Lab Software4.0.1 (Bio-Rad).  The following primary antibodies were used: GLUT4 (2213, 1:1000), AKT2 (6063, 1:1000), p-AKT2 (ser 479) (8599, 1:1000), cyclin D1 (2978, 1:1000), cyclin D3 (2936, 1:2000), and cyclin B1 (4138, 1:1000) were purchased from Cell Signaling, BDH1 (MA5-15594, 1:1000) and GAPDH (MA5-15738, 1:5000) were purchased from Thermo Scientific, CX-43 (ab11370, 1:100000) was purchased from Abcam, OXCT1 (12175-1-AP, 1:10000) was purchased from Proteintech, and myc (which detects myc-tagged E2F6) (11667149001, 1:2000) was purchased from Roche. Secondary antibodies anti-mouse (115-035-003, 1:15000) and anti-rabbit (111-035-045, 1:15000) were purchased from Jackson Immunochemicals.    Neonatal Cardiomyocyte Isolation and Treatment  Hearts were collected from Wt and Tg mice at post-natal day 1 following decapitation. Hearts were rinsed in HBSS and incubated in 0.5% trypsin dissolved in HBSS overnight at 4°C while genotyping was performed. Hearts were grouped in twos or threes (by genotype) for digestion with 0.5% Collagenase type II (Gibco) dissolved in HBSS (4x10min). Cells were collected after each digestion via centrifugation at 3000g for 3 minutes and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids. Total suspensions were plated on uncoated 10cm dishes to remove fibroblasts (45min x2). Cardiomyocytes were seeded onto 0.1% gelatin coated plates (300000/well on XF e 24 well plate for Seahorse metabolic analysis, or 1x10 6 /well on 6 well plates for ketone treatment) and allowed to attach for 48 hours in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO 2 .  Paired neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated with or without 3.8mM β-hydroxybutyrate (Sigma) dissolved in water for 24 hours, or used for glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation measurements (described below).    Seahorse Glycolysis Measurement  Cardiomyocyte media was replaced with bicarbonate and glucose free DMEM containing 2mM glutamine. The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was measured using an XF e 24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Triplicate pre-injection readings were taken to establish a baseline, followed by triplicate reading after sequential treatment with 20mM glucose, 2mg/mL oligomycin, and 100mM 2-deoxy-glucose. ECAR was corrected to baseline pre-injection measurements.    Seahorse Fatty Acid Oxidation Measurement  Cardiomyocytes were starved for 24hr in substrate limited medium (DMEM, 0.5mM glucose, 1.0mM Glutamine, 0.5mM L-carnitine, 1% FBS) and replaced with fatty acid oxidation assay medium (111mM NaCl, 4.7mM KCl, 1.25mM CaCl 2 , 2.0mM MgSO 4 , NaH 2 PO 4 , 2.5mM glucose, 0.5mM L-carnitine, and 5mM HEPES). Cardiomyocytes were treated with or without 40μM etomoxir for 15min. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured using the XF e 24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Triplicate pre-injection readings were recorded to establish baseline and cardiomyocytes were sequentially treated with either 17μM BSA or 100 μM palmitate conjugated to BSA and: 2mg/mL oligomycin, 1μM Carbonyl cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone, and 1μM Antimycin-A. OCR was corrected to baseline pre-injection measurements.    Statistical Analyses  All data were analyzed with a student t-test with the exception of the protein expression data, which was analyzed with a two way mixed ANOVA with repeated measures where indicated. The level of significance was set at P <0.05 in all cases.     Results   E2F6 Induces the Early Expression of BDH1 in Neonatal Myocardium  E2F6 expression in postnatal myocardium led to dose dependent DCM associated with decreased levels of CX-43[ 23 , 24 ]. Our previous microarray results predicted the up-regulation of Bdh1 in E2F6-Tg hearts thus we performed RT-q-PCR on mRNA collected from Wt and Tg pup hearts for validation. A 40 fold increase of Bdh1 transcript was detected in Tg myocardium ( P <0.05) ( Fig 1A ). BDH1 protein was barely detectable in Wt pup hearts but was markedly upregulated by 890% ( P <0.05) in E2F6 Tg hearts at post-natal day 1 (P1) ( Fig 1B , quantified in 1C ). Since BDH1 is up-regulated in the failing adult human heart [ 10 ] we examined its expression at 6 weeks of age, at which time Tg mice show full onset of DCM[ 24 ]. Western blot analysis did not reveal any difference in BDH1 level between Tg and Wt hearts at this time ( Fig 1B , quantified in 1C ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170066.g001  Fig 1   E2F6 Activates BDH1 Expression in Neonatal Myocardium.

( D) Immunoblot of protein from Wt and Tg myocardium with BDH1 at the indicated time points after birth.* P <0.05.     We next examined the developmental expression of BDH1 protein in post-natal myocardium between P1 and 6wks. In normal developing myocardium BDH1 protein is undetectable at P1 and appears at 6 weeks of age ( Fig 1D ). On the other hand, in E2F6-Tg hearts, BDH1 expression appears to be maximally expressed as early as P1 with this level maintained at P7, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. It should be noted that symptoms of DCM arise as early as 2 weeks in E2F6-Tg mice[ 24 ], thus BDH1 is markedly elevated prior to the early development of DCM and maintained at this level into adulthood ( Fig 1D ).  The induction of BDH1 expression by E2F6 was specific since the succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase (OXCT1) (another rate limiting enzyme in ketone metabolism) was not changed at the mRNA ( Fig 1A ) or protein level in heart tissue from pup or adult E2F6-Tg mice ( Fig 1B , quantified 1C ).    E2F6 Impairs Glycolysis in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes  Since ketone metabolism is increased when glucose is scarce, we measured glycolysis in in Tg mice to gauge whether changes in glycolytic rates may have stimulated BDH1 expression. We used the Seahorse method to monitor the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a measure of glycolysis which produces lactic acid. In nutrient starved neonatal cardiomyocytes (pre-injection) ECAR measurements were similar in Wt and Tg, but Tg ECAR readings were lower following the addition of glucose and oligomycin (inhibitor of ATP synthase that drives glycolysis) ( Fig 2A ). The competitive inhibitor of glucose, 2-Deoxy-glucose (2-DG), caused the ECAR readings to return to baseline in both Wt and Tg cardiomyocytes demonstrating the specificity of the experiment to glucose ( Fig 2A ). Calculation of basal glycolysis revealed a 22% decrease in E2F6 expressing cardiomyocytes ( P <0.05) ( Fig 2B ). No significant changes in glycolytic capacity or reserve were noted.   10.1371/journal.pone.0170066.g002  Fig 2   E2F6 Impairs Glycolysis in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes.

( D) Densitometric quantification of immunoblots. Expression is normalized against GAPDH (n = 4). * P<0 . 05 .     Glucose entry into cardiomyocytes is a rate limiting step in glycolysis, thus we examined changes in the cardiac glucose transporter: GLUT4.Western blot analysis of protein isolated from Wt and Tg myocardium at P1 with anti-GLUT4 detected a GLUT4 monomer of ~50kDa and high molecular weight polypeptides which are GLUT4 oligomers ( Fig 2C ). Quantification of all polypeptides revealed a 39% decrease in total GLUT4 protein ( P <0.05) ( Fig 2D ). RT-q-PCR revealed no change in GLUT4 transcript levels in Tg myocardium ( S1 Fig ) indicating its loss is post-transcriptional.  We also examined the expression of another major regulator of glucose metabolism: AKT2 (also known as protein kinase B). Western blot analysis with anti- total AKT2 (T-AKT2) revealed a 100% increase in E2F6-Tg hearts ( P <0.05), while analysis of phosphorylated (active) AKT2 revealed no change ( Fig 2C , quantified in Fig 2D ). The ratio of phospho: total AKT2 was decreased by ~50% ( P <0.05) in Tg myocardium indicating less AKT2 activation as a fraction of the total AKT2 pool ( Fig 2D ).    E2F6 Does Not Impact Fatty Acid Oxidation in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes  In the failing human heart the up-regulation of BDH1 is believed to be an adaptation to a decrease in lipid metabolism[ 8 , 9 ]. Thus, we also assessed lipid metabolism in neonatal cardiomyocytes from Wt and Tg mice. We used the seahorse method to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) which revealed no change in fatty acid oxidation in E2F6-expressing cardiomyocytes at pre-injection, or following the sequential addition of palmitate (fatty acid), oligomycin (inhibitor of ATP synthase), Carbonyl cyanide-4-phenylhydrazone (FCCP/uncoupler) or antimycin-A (electron transport chain inhibitor) ( Fig 3 ). Cardiomyocytes treated with etomoxir (inhibitor of fatty acid entry) showed no significant increase in OCR beyond baseline, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the experiments to fatty acids ( S2 Fig ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170066.g003  Fig 3   E2F6 Does Not Impact Fatty Acid Oxidation in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes.

Cardiomyocytes were sequentially incubated with BSA or palmitate, oligo (oligomycin), FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide-4-phenylhydrazone), and Anti-A (Antimycin-A). Results represent mean±SEM values (n = 7–8).       E2F6 Deregulates Cyclin Expression in Myocardium  The E2F/Rb pathway is believed to drive glycolysis via the transcriptional regulation of cyclins [ 28 ]. Thus, we examined the expression of various cyclins in Wt and Tg myocardium at post-natal day 1. Cyclin D1 and D3 expression levels were not altered in cardiac tissue from E2F6-Tg mice ( Fig 4A , quantified in 4B ) while cyclin B1 was reduced by 70% in E2F6-Tg myocardium ( P <0.05) ( Fig 4A , quantified in 4B ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170066.g004  Fig 4   E2F6 Deregulates Cyclin B1 Expression in Myocardium.

Ketones Regulate Connexin-43 in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes  Recent evidence indicates that ketones can enhance CX-43 protein in endothelial cells via the Extracellular Receptor Kinase (ERK) pathway[ 29 ]. We previously noted the deregulation of ERK activity and a loss of CX-43 protein in adult Tg mice[ 23 ], and in the present study we detected a 50% down-regulation of CX-43 protein at post-natal day 1 ( P <0.05) ( Fig 5A , quantified in 5B ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0170066.g005  Fig 5   β-OHB Regulates CX-43 Protein Expression in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes.

A two-way ANOVA was used to measure statistical significance. ( E ) Representative immunoblot analysis of BDH1 in Wt and Tg neonatal cardiomyocytes. * P<0 . 05 .     We hypothesized that the excess BDH1present in Tg hearts could limit the amount of β-OHB in the cardiomyocyte via its conversion to acetoacetate and subsequent availability for the ketone catabolic pathway. This could in turn inhibit the signaling capacity of β-OHB (the most stable and abundant ketone) and thus may contribute to the observed down-regulation of CX-43 in Tg hearts. To test this we examined the amount of CX-43 in neonatal cardiomyocytes incubated with or without the β-OHB. Wt cardiomyocytes incubated with β-OHB showed a 100% increase of CX-43 ( P <0.05) ( Fig 5C , quantified in 5D ), similar to what was recently reported in endothelial cells[ 29 ]. In contrast, β-OHB had no significant impact on CX-43 expression in Tg cardiomyocytes supporting our hypothesis that BDH1 reduces ketone signaling.  Surprisingly, the reduction of CX-43 noted in vivo ( Fig 5A ) was reversed in culture of Tg cardiomyocytes ( Fig 5B ). In order to rule out the possibility that BDH1 was reduced in culture, thereby reversing its effect on CX-43 expression, we assessed its level in cultured cardiomyocytes. Western blot with anti-BDH1 detected its presence in neonatal cardiomyocytes cultured from Tg mice, but not Wt, indicating that its loss is not responsible for the rescue of CX-43 in culture ( Fig 5E ). This suggests the presence of factors in the culture media which specifically promote expression of CX-43 in neonatal cardiomyocyte from Tg hearts. In support of this hypothesis, Tg cardiomyocytes showed an increase in CX-43 expression over time in culture ( S4 Fig ).     Discussion  The E2F pathway regulates early cardiac development through mechanisms that impact cell proliferation, hypertrophy, and death[ 30 – 33 ]. We previously demonstrated that the E2F pathway can also impact post-natal cardiac function via manipulation of the pathway in vivo with the repressor E2F6[ 23 , 24 ]. E2F6 resulted in dose dependent DCM associated with inappropriate activation of E2F responsive genes, but without changes in cardiac growth or death[ 23 , 24 ]. Further, our data also revealed that the E2F pathway can impact β-adrenergic signaling in the post-natal heart[ 24 ]. Here we demonstrate that deregulation of the E2F pathway impairs glycolysis in the developing postnatal myocardium, and markedly enhances that expression of the ketogenic enzyme, BDH1, which was linked to the down-regulation of CX-43. Thus we present notable evidence that appropriate modulation of the E2F pathway is critical for regulating cardiac metabolism and, consequently, function of post-natal myocardium.  E2F6-Tg mice present with an early reduction of CX-43 and a defect in cardiac function potentially accounting for the noted DCM and sudden death [ 23 ]. Recent studies demonstrated that β–OHB can enhance CX-43 expression in endothelial cells [ 29 ] which we have now also noted in Wt neonatal cardiomyocytes. This suggests that ketones may uniquely modulate the gap junction levels in different cell types. It should be noted that CX-43 expression was rescued in culture of Tg cardiomyocytes while BDH1 was still highly expressed. Thus other factors appear to have an effect on CX-43 expression in culture conditions. In this regard, multiple MAPK pathways have been implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of CX-43, and these were deregulated in E2F6-Tg mice [ 34 , 29 , 23 ]. It is possible that deregulation of MAPKs may have sensitized E2F6-Tg cardiomyocytes to growth factors in the culture media.  Despite differences in vitro and in vivo both neonatal cardiomyocytes and hearts from Tg mice show a marked induction of BDH1 and a diminished capacity to regulate CX-43 expression. In the heart, Tg-mice do not enhance CX-43 levels to the appropriate level required for cardiac function, and in culture, Tg cardiomyocytes are unresponsive to CX-43 ketone signaling pathways. In both cases this likely involves the marked induction of BDH1 protein which could diminish the available β-OHB (via its conversion to a less stable ketone) thereby driving it towards the ketone catabolic pathway and reducing its ability to act as a signaling molecule to enhance the amount of CX-43. The resulting down-regulation of CX-43 in Tg myocardium would alter cardiomyocyte communication and function from a very young age, potentially leading to the early DCM noted. In this regard, CX-43 is reported to be down-regulated in the diabetic rat heart and in many types of heart failure [ 34 – 37 ]. Further, metabolic remodeling is known to occur in heart failure with enhanced BDH1 and ketone signaling [ 9 , 10 ]. Hence our data here may critically serve to link enhanced BDH1 and the loss of CX-43 in the adult failing heart as well. It has previously been demonstrated that an increase in BDH1 transcript levels in both mouse and human cardiac tissue is associated with enhanced BDH1 activity and ketone metabolism [ 9 , 10 ]. While we have not measured BDH1 activity here, the robust increase in both transcript and protein levels induced by E2F6 imply an enhanced BDH1enzyme activity as early as postnatal day 1.  The relationship between E2F, BDH1, and CX-43 highlights the emerging idea that ketones not only serve as energy substrates, but are also important signaling molecules which can regulate gene expression during nutrient scarcity/adaptation. Ketones can initiate undefined signaling cascades via binding to G-protein coupled receptors, or by direct interaction with and inhibition of HDACs [ 38 , 39 ] . Rb recruits HDACs to repress E2F responsive genes [ 40 , 41 ], which we have shown to be inhibited by E2F6 expression in the heart[ 23 ]. Furthermore, we found that E2F6 also regulates G-coupled protein receptor signaling pathways [ 24 ], suggesting a novel relationship between E2F/Rb, HDACs, and ketones which critically impacts myocardial growth, function, and metabolism.  It is plausible that BDH1 was induced by E2F6 in Tg myocardium to compensate for the impairment in glycolysis (which is the major source of energy in the neonatal heart). The decrease in GLUT4 protein could have limited glucose entry to E2F6-Tg cardiomyocytes, and when coupled with the observed decrease in AKT2 activation (which regulates glucose homeostasis) could account for the impaired glycolysis [ 42 ]. Alterations in glucose metabolism have been previously linked to the E2F/Rb pathway as demonstrated by double knock-out of E2F1/E2F2 which impaired insulin production and caused diabetes [ 43 ]. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that E2F/Rb promote glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation in muscle and fat tissue via the deregulation of cyclin, in particular cyclin D1 [ 28 , 44 ]. Thus it is a logical extension that E2F6, which inhibits E2F/Rb activity, would also inhibit glycolysis. E2F6-Tg mice express less cyclinB1 which could represent a delay in the cardiac cell cycle (i.e. not reaching mitosis) similar to what was observed in E2F6 expressing 3T3 cells which accumulated in S phase[ 21 ]. Such a shift in the cell cycle could cause a shift in the metabolic profile as well. The specific change in cyclin B1 may involve the reduction of E2F3 in E2F6-Tg myocardium [ 23 ] since it is a critical regulator of the cell cycle during perinatal cardiac development [ 25 ]. This suggests that E2F3 may also be a key regulator of cyclin B1 and glycolysis in the heart. Further, since fatty acid oxidation is not increased in response to the depression of glycolysis, ketolysis may be a necessary adaptation as an alternative energy source.  It is interesting to note that BDH1 levels were not increased in the adult (6wk old) Tg-myocardium which are experiencing heart failure. This may reflect the fact that fatty acids are the major energy substrate at this time and fatty acid metabolism appeared to be unaffected in E2F6 Tg mice. This implies that the induction of BDH1 may be an early marker for metabolic stress/changes in the myocardium that precede heart failure. There is a window of overlap between enhanced BDH1 expression and the early symptoms of DCM around 3 weeks supporting the correlative relationship [ 24 ]. This may be particularly useful information for ~40% of cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and early-onset of disease.  The robust increase of Bdh1 transcript by E2F6 at birth and the lack of change in other ketogenic enzymes, such as OXCT1, imply a specific role for E2Fs through a transcriptional mechanism. A basic promoter analysis did not detect an E2F consensus binding site in the Bdh1 promoter ( S3 Fig ). This does not rule out direct transcriptional regulation as E2F6 has been demonstrated to bind to DNA at non-consensus sites and activate transcription [ 45 , 46 ]. A nuclear-factor (NF)-kappaB site was predicted by the promoter analysis 1938bp upstream of the BDH1 transcription start site (core score 1.00). This is of particular interest because E2Fs can bind to and de-regulate NF-kappaB in the context of inflammation and metabolism [ 47 , 48 ]. Thus it is possible that the deregulation of E2Fs in E2F6-Tg myocardium may have enabled NF-kappaB to flip a metabolic switch activating BDH1 in the neonatal heart. In support of this, E2F1-3 levels normally drop in the adult myocardium [ 49 ] when we have demonstrated that BDH1 is normally expressed.  The data here demonstrate a novel role for the E2F pathway in regulating metabolism in post-natal myocardium since its perturbation by E2F6 leads to aberrant glycolysis and the induction of the ketogenic enzyme: BDH1. These changes appear to impact ketogenic signaling to deregulate CX-43 levels and thereby disrupt cardiac function. The potent early induction of BDH1 prior to a discernable cardiac pathology implies that BDH1 is an early biomarker of metabolic stress and DCM. The information here could provide new insight into the early diagnosis and potential treatment options in idiopathic cases of DCM.

We study a theoretical model for the toxin-antitoxin (hok/sok) mechanism for plasmid maintenance in bacteria. Toxin-antitoxin systems enforce the maintenance of a plasmid through post-segregational killing of cells that have lost the plasmid. Key to their function is the tight regulation of expression of a protein toxin by an sRNA antitoxin. Here, we focus on the nonlinear nature of the regulatory circuit dynamics of the toxin-antitoxin mechanism. The mechanism relies on a transient increase in protein concentration rather than on the steady state of the genetic circuit. Through a systematic analysis of the parameter dependence of this transient increase, we confirm some known design features of this system and identify new ones: for an efficient toxin-antitoxin mechanism, the synthesis rate of the toxin’s mRNA template should be lower that of the sRNA antitoxin, the mRNA template should be more stable than the sRNA antitoxin, and the mRNA-sRNA complex should be more stable than the sRNA antitoxin. Moreover, a short half-life of the protein toxin is also beneficial to the function of the toxin-antitoxin system. In addition, we study a therapeutic scenario in which a competitor mRNA is introduced to sequester the sRNA antitoxin, causing the toxic protein to be expressed.

Some of the best known sRNA regulation systems are related to plasmid replication and plasmid maintenance in bacteria. In the first case, an sRNA controls whether synthesis of a replication primer proceeds to plasmid replication [ 5 – 7 ]. In the second, the plasmid encodes a (type I) toxin-antitoxin system such as the hok/sok system (“host-killing/suppression-of-killing”), encoding a protein toxin and an antisense RNA which acts as an antitoxin by binding to the toxin mRNA and blocking ribosome access, thus preventing toxin synthesis [ 8 ]. (Other types of toxin-antitoxin systems have different functions [ 9 ], in particular related to the formation of persister cells [ 10 ].)  The toxin-antitoxin system, which is also known as an “addiction module”, maintains the plasmid number through post-segregational killing of plasmid-free progeny due to differential stability of the toxin and antitoxin RNAs. The killing is done by a potent protein toxin that irreversibly damages the cell membrane [ 11 ]. In a steady state with a stable plasmid concentration, sRNA antitoxin exists in excessive molar amount compared to target mRNA, such that the latter is entirely sequestered in translationally inactive sRNA-mRNA complexes [ 12 ]. However, when a progeny cell becomes plasmid-free through cell division, synthesis of both toxin mRNA and antitoxin sRNA are stopped. The sRNA, which has a very short half-life, is rapidly depleted and the more stable target mRNA can be translated into toxic protein, killing the cell ( Fig 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.g001  Fig 1   Simplified drawing of the sRNA regulated toxin-antitoxin mechanism for plasmid maintenance.  Structural transitions and processing of the mRNA have been omitted [ 8 ]. Parameters of the system are labeled in blue: α m , α s , α p are the synthesis rates of mRNA, sRNA and protein (transcription and translation rates, respectively); β m , β s , β c , β p are the degradation rates of mRNA, sRNA, the mRNA-sRNA complex and protein, respectively; h + and h − are the binding and unbinding rate of the complex.     To understand the design of the gene circuit encoding the toxin-antitoxin mechanism of post-segregational killing, here we analyze a theoretical model for the dynamics of such a circuit. The model is related to and extends previous models for sRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation [ 4 , 13 , 14 ]. It allows us to address the parameter dependence of the genetic circuit to identify essential features and criteria for its efficient function, for example, whether there are any criteria beyond the difference between toxin and antitoxin RNA lifetime. It also allows us to test whether the system can be designed in such a way that only complete loss of the plasmids triggers killing and not a low but non-zero plasmid copy number. We also use the model to study a proposed antibacterial strategy [ 15 , 16 ] making use of regulatory crosstalk between RNAs. To answer these questions we performed extensive parameter sweeps, scanning all parameters of the model individually as well as extensively testing randomly chosen parameter sets, thus varying all parameters simultaneously. Overall, the model confirms the known principles for the function of the toxin-antitoxin mechanism as the dominant ones, in particular, the difference in RNA lifetime and the threshold condition on the synthesis rates. In addition, it also indicates a few new design features. Specifically, our analysis of the parameter dependence shows that the stability of the mRNA-sRNA complex plays an important role as well and should exceed the stability of the free antitoxin. Moreover, an unstable toxic protein is superior to a stable one for induction of killing upon plasmid loss.    Model and Methods   Dynamic Equations and Analytical Solution of Steady State Concentrations  The dynamics of a toxin-antitoxin system as described in Fig 1 , is modeled with four coupled ordinary differential equations for four dynamical variables, the concentrations of the toxin mRNA ( m ), the antitoxin sRNA ( s ), the toxic protein ( p ) and of the mRNA-sRNA complex ( c ), in which the mRNA is silenced. All concentrations are expressed in units of number of molecules per volume of a cell. The four equations describe the synthesis and degradation of the mRNA, the sRNA, and the protein, as well as the formation and dissociation of the mRNA-sRNA complex: m  ˙  =  α  m  ·  g  -  β  m  ·  m  -  h  +  ·  m  ·  s  +  h  -  ·  c  (1a)  s  ˙  =  α  s  ·  g  -  β  s  ·  s  -  h  +  ·  m  ·  s  +  h  -  ·  c  (1b)  c  ˙  =  h  +  ·  m  ·  s  -  h  -  ·  c  -  β  c  ·  c  (1c)  p  ˙  =  α  p  ·  m  -  β  p  ·  p  (1d)  The 10 parameters of these equations are as follows: α m , α s , α p are the synthesis rates of mRNA, sRNA and protein (transcription and translation rates, respectively); β m , β s , β c , β p are the degradation rates of mRNA, sRNA, the mRNA-sRNA complex and protein, respectively; h + and h − are the binding and unbinding rate of the complex, and g is the plasmid copy number per cell volume.  A few remarks are in order with respect to the model’s generality. First, for many toxin-antitoxin systems, including hok/sok and the pAD1 par system, there exist intramolecular structures of the toxin mRNA that prohibit the translation of protein by partially restricting ribosome access. Such structural states of the mRNA are not included in our model. However, averaging over the active and inactivated configurations of the mRNA, we obtain an effective synthesis rate of the protein and an effective degradation rate of the mRNA, which do not qualitatively alter the model. Averaging requires however that the mRNA switches between those configurations sufficiently rapidly. Second, saturation of the toxin-antitoxin binding naturally occurs within this model (provided that binding is sufficiently strong) and is accounted for in the nonlinear binding term h + ⋅ m ⋅ s . As a consequence an excess of antitoxin sRNA over toxin mRNA results in all toxin mRNA being sequestered in complexes, as discussed in more detail below. Third, the effect of dilution by cell growth can be seen as included in the degradation rates. Dilution by cell growth sets a lower limit on all degradation rates, so proteins or RNA effectively cannot have half-lives exceeding the doubling time of the cell (even though their true degradation rate, due to proteolysis and RNA degradation could be lower).  The steady state solution is obtained by setting the time derivatives on the left hand side of the equations to zero. The steady state for this system can be explicitly given, because the nonlinear terms cancel each other in Eqs ( 1a ) and ( 1b ), leaving a quadratic equation which can be solved analytically. This leads to the steady state sRNA concentration: s  *  =  -  A  ±  A  2  +  4  β  s  β  m  α  s  g  h  +  β  c  h  -  +  β  c  2  β  s  h  +  β  c  h  -  +  β  c , where A  =  (  α  m  g  -  α  s  g  )  h  +  β  c  h  -  +  β  c  +  β  s  β  m . The steady state concentrations of the other three components can be in turn given as: m  *  =  α  m  g  -  α  s  g  +  β  s  s  *  β  m  c  *  =  m  *  s  *  h  +  h  -  +  β  c  p  *  =  α  p  m  *  β  p  (2)  This result includes some limiting cases that have been studied in earlier work on sRNA-dependent gene regulation. In the limit of large binding and unbinding rates h + and h − (i.e. the limit of “rapid equilibrium”), the steady state concentration of the RNA complex concentration becomes c * = ( m * s * h + )/ h − , as previously obtained by Legewie et al. [ 13 ]. The limit of irreversible binding, h − = 0, in which only the equations for sRNA and mRNA concentrations need to be considered, was previously studied by Levine et al. [ 4 ] and Mitarai et al. [ 14 ].    Numerical Methods  To study the dynamic behavior, Eqs ( 1a – 1d ) are numerically integrated using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method with an integration time step on the order of 1 × 10 −4 min, for a time span of 300 min. We note that the time unit of the dynamics could be made dimensionless by rescaling all rates relative to one rate that determines the time unit. Correspondingly, the results presented below will typically depend on ratios of time scales or rates. To achieve both stability and speed, an adaptive time step for the numerical integration is implemented, such that when the integration becomes numerically unstable, a smaller time step is used. A tell-tale sign for numerical instability is the appearance of negative concentration values of one or more components. The analytical results for the steady state concentrations are in good agreement (up to floating point error) with the results obtained from the numerical integration.     Results and Discussion   Qualitative Description of the Dynamics of the Genetic Circuit  For the model described above, the following scenario is considered: the dynamics of the toxin-antitoxin system begin with a cell which has just acquired one or more copies of the plasmid, but has not yet synthesized any of its products, i.e. we start with m = s = c = p = 0. The dynamics are numerically integrated for a sufficiently long time, so that a steady state of the system is reached. At a certain time point (here at t = 150 min of a total t = 300 min), the plasmid copy number is set to 0 to mimic plasmid loss, e.g. due to insufficient replication or unequal partitioning of the plasmid during cell division. To illustrate the dynamics, realistic values of the parameters are used, which are estimated from the literature ( Table 1 ). Eqs ( 1a – 1d ) are numerically integrated to produce Fig 2 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.t001  Table 1   Table of parameter values based on the literature for toxin-antitoxin systems and related sRNA regulation systems.  For some parameters, the values are know to depend on growth conditions, which is not explicitly incorporated into our model. For components with long half life, the degradation rate is dominated by dilution through cell growth and division, which provides a lower limit on the possible (effective) degradation rates.                  α m [gene copy −1 min −1 ]  β m [min −1 ]  α s [gene copy −1 min −1 ]  β s [min −1 ]  α p [min −1 ]  β p [min −1 ]      Range of values  0.1–15.8  0.034–0.693  0.1–15.8  0.35–1.4  1–7  0.0346    References  [ 4 , 17 , 18 ]  [ 19 , 20 ]  [ 4 , 17 , 18 , 21 ]  [ 8 , 19 , 22 , 23 ]   [ 8 ]    Default parameters used here  1.0  0.2  6.0  1.0  5.0  0.035        10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.g002  Fig 2   Simulated dynamics of the toxin-antitoxin gene circuit.  The different colors show the concentrations (in molecules per cell volume) of mRNA (orange), sRNA (blue), mRNA-sRNA complex (red) and protein (green). At t = 150 min, the plasmid is lost, described by resetting the copy number g to zero, inducing a transient peak in the protein concentration. The protein concentration peak fold-increase R is 8.6 and the peak width T p equals 48 min. The parameters are as listed in the last row of Table 1 and g = 6.0, h + = 20.0, h − = 1.0, β c = 0.1.     In Fig 2 , all four concentrations increase initially until the first steady state is reached. At t = 150 min, due to the loss of all plasmid copies, the synthesis of new RNA molecules stops. Nevertheless, a transient increase in the free mRNA concentration is observed, which results in a transient increase of the protein concentration. The transient increase in mRNA is a result of sRNA degrading much faster than mRNA, so when a mRNA-sRNA complex dissociates, there is a surplus amount of free mRNA molecules released, which in turn allows the synthesis of toxic protein. Thus, the main function of the toxin-antitoxin system, plasmid maintenance via the synthesis of a toxin upon plasmid loss, which results in the removal of plasmid-free cells from the population, is dependent on a transient dynamics rather than on a steady state. This behavior is in contrast to other sRNA-based regulation systems, which are based on similar mechanisms, but control the steady state concentration of mRNA [ 4 ].  For a quantitative characterization of the dynamics, specifically that of the protein concentration change after the loss of plasmids, two quantities are measured for each simulated scenario: (i) the peak fold-increase of the protein concentration, R , defined as the ratio of the maximum of the protein concentration after plasmid loss and the steady state protein concentration before the plasmid loss, R = p peak / p *; and (ii) the transient peak width T p , defined as the width of the peak at half maximum.  The effectiveness of the toxin-antitoxin mechanism is partially determined by the protein concentration peak fold-increase R , as opposed to by the absolute concentration of the toxin. A high peak fold-increase allows a toxicity threshold to be set, such that the fluctuations of the steady state protein concentration are very unlikely to cross such a threshold and thereby “accidentally” lead to cell death, while simultaneously permitting the transient increase of protein concentration when the plasmid number is not being properly maintained to easily overcome such a threshold. For example, if the cell will be killed by a 10-fold-increase in toxin concentration (10 being the killing threshold), and if there is little chance of an accidental 10-fold protein concentration increase due to other factors and noise, the dynamics which can produce R > 10 are considered effective in exerting a robust control on the host cell.    Dependence of the protein dynamics on individual model parameters  We first investigate the parameter dependence of the model by varying each parameter in isolation, holding the other 9 fixed at constant values. In all cases, the peak fold-increase R and the peak width T p are determined as functions of the modulated parameters.  First, the dependence of R and T p on the plasmid copy number g ( Fig 3 ) is investigated. An increase of g is equivalent to increasing the synthesis rates of the sRNA and mRNA molecules by the same ratio. R and T p are both positively affected when g is increased. For the default parameters ( Fig 3(a) ) as well as for the rapid equilibrium case ( Fig 3(b) ), the rates of change of both R and T p (i.e. the slope of the curves) are higher when g is low, and lower when g is high. In the case of rapid equilibrium, i.e. when both h + and h − are high, the changes in R and T p at the loss of one or two plasmid copies are more substantial than in the cases of lower binding and unbinding rates. This is to say, in the case of rapid equilibrium, the model could be effective in triggering killing even when the plasmids are not completely lost.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.g003  Fig 3   Dependence on plasmid copy number g .  (a,b) protein concentration peak fold-increase R and width T p as a function of the plasmid copy number g for our default binding and unbinding rates h + = 20, h − = 1 (a), and for rapid equilibrium with h + = 1000, h − = 10 (b). (c) the simulation of sequential plasmid loss under default parameters. The plasmid copy number is reduced from 7 → 6 → 3 → 1 → 0. A substantial increase in toxin concentration only occurs when the last plasmid is lost.     Another way to think about plasmid maintenance is shown in the simulation of sequential loss of plasmid copies under default parameters ( Fig 3(c) ). The change in plasmid number does not result in the sudden release of large amount of toxin until the last plasmid is lost. Comparing to when all plasmids are lost at once ( Fig 2 ), sequential plasmid loss will result in a less prominent transient peak when the last plasmid is lost. This observation is consistent with the function of the toxin-antitoxin system to enforce plasmid maintenance, i.e. the host cells are forced to retain at least one copy of the plasmid, but there is little dependence on whether there are more or fewer copies.  The dependence of R and T p on the other 9 parameters are shown in Fig 4 . In general, two conditions for the existence of a transient peak of the toxic protein concentration can be extracted from these parameter dependence:   10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.g004  Fig 4   Dependence on individual model parameters.  Each model parameter is varied in isolation while the other 9 parameters are held fixed. The toxic protein concentration peak fold-increase R (purple) and the width of the peak T p (blue) are plotted as functions of each parameter in the 9 subfigures. The default parameter values (from Table 1 and as in Fig 2 ) are marked by red lines in the plots.     First, the synthesis rate of sRNA ( α s ) must exceed the synthesis rate of mRNA ( α m ). This threshold condition can be observed by comparing the varying values to the default values for mRNA and sRNA synthesis rates. In Fig 4(a) , when the synthesis rate of mRNA α m exceeds the default synthesis rate of sRNA α s at 6/min/gene copy, the peak disappears. Conversely in Fig 4(b) , when α s becomes larger than α m at a default value of 1/min/gene copy, the protein concentration peak starts to appear ( R > 1).  This threshold condition is well-known for sRNA regulation [ 4 ]. It can be explained as follows. Increasing the number of mRNA molecules while keeping the number of sRNA molecules constant increases both the protein concentration peak p peak as well as the first steady state protein concentration p *. However, p * increases faster than p peak as α m increases. Therefore the relative increase of the protein concentration R diminishes as α m increases. A high level of free mRNA before plasmid loss will also mean that plasmid-containing cell might “poison itself” without any loss of plasmids. When α m > α s , there will be more free mRNA than what can be “neutralized” by complex formation, and the toxic protein will be expressed at a high level before the loss of plasmids. The toxin-antitoxin mechanism relies on the low amount of surplus of free mRNA after the loss of plasmids, so that when α m is higher than α s , this effect is lost.  Second, the degradation rate of sRNA must exceed the degradation rate of mRNA: β s > β m . This condition ensures that after the loss of plasmids, a pool of free mRNA builds up, since the sRNA is degraded more rapidly. When sRNA is more long-lived than mRNA, that is, when β m exceeds β s at 1/min, or when β s is lower than β m at 0.2/min ( Fig 4c and 4d ), a pronounced protein concentration peak is not observed. In the following section, when we discuss the results of random sampling of the parameter space, we will show that this condition on the degradation rates of the RNAs is not as strict as the threshold condition on the synthesis rates. This can be seen in Fig 5(a) , where some parameter combination exhibit a protein peak despite a ratio β m / β s > 1, while there never is a peak for α m / α s > 1.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.g005  Fig 5   Parameter dependence found by random parameter sampling.  The color gradient shows the magnitude of the protein peak fold-increase R . In Fig (a), the results are projected onto α m / α s vs. β m / β s on a log-log scale. In (b) the simulation results that fall within the subregion α m / α s < 0.8 and β m / β s < 4 (marked by lines in Fig (a)) are projected onto β c vs. β s . In (c,d) the parameter sets are further restricted to the subregion α m / α s > 0.8, β m / β s > 4 and β c / β s < 2/3 (marked by a dark line in Fig (b)) and the results are projected onto h + vs. h − in Fig (c), and β p vs. β m in Fig (d), respectively. The color scale values are taken to be log 1.4 R for ease of viewing. Dark lines mark the rough division between the region with more high peaks and the region with fewer. In (c) and (d) the dark lines mark h + = h − and β p = β m respectively.     Besides these main two conditions, high binding rate, low unbinding rate and sufficient stability of the complex are also needed as shown in Fig 4e–4g . This is consistent with the previous knowledge that the binding rate strongly influences the effectiveness of the toxin-antitoxin mechanism [ 24 , 25 ]. Finally in Fig 4(i) , when the protein degradation rate β p is very low (equivalent to having a half life of longer than 5 min), R decreases drastically and eventually drops to a constant around 4, where no protein is being degraded. Thus, the proteolysis of the toxic protein contributes to the efficiency of the toxin-antitoxin mechanism for plasmid maintenance. The translation (protein synthesis) rate, on the other hand, has no effect on the ratio R as expected ( Fig 4(h) ).  The parameter dependence study shows two features of the toxin-antitoxin system that were not known or have not been demonstrated via theoretical studies. Firstly, it is known that the antitoxin sRNA in plasmid number maintenance is very short-lived [ 26 ] (which is indeed true for many types of sRNA [ 27 , 28 ]), while the toxin mRNA has an unusually long half-life [ 26 ]. However, in the numerical study above we find when the degradation rate of the sRNA exceeds that of the template mRNA, in some range, the mechanism becomes actually less effective: R decreases in Fig 4(d) after β s becomes larger than around 0.5. However, we did not see this effect clearly in the random sampling of the parameter space in the following section. It is therefore possible this effect only applies to situations where some other parameters, for example the synthesis rates of the RNA molecules, take on certain values.  Secondly, in some well-studied cases, the binding of mRNA with sRNA leads to the rapid degradation of the complex [ 29 ]. However, this cannot be the case here. As shown in Fig 4(g) , when the RNA complex is degraded at a rate higher than 0.8 there is no transient toxin peak at all ( R = 0). This can be explained by the fact that mRNA must be released from the complex upon plasmid loss, which requires a sufficiently high concentration of the complex. If the complex degradation rate β c is too high, too few mRNA templates will be left for the translation of the toxin. Nevertheless, complex stability is an important parameter beyond this obvious feature, as will be shown by the second parameter dependence study conducted in the following section “Random Sampling of the Parameter Space” Fig 5(b) . Indeed, a stabilization of RNAs in the complex has been demonstrated in at least one toxin-antitoxin system, the par system in the E. faecalis [ 30 ].    Random Sampling of the Parameter Space  We have seen that the dependence of the toxin-antitoxin circuit on the individual parameters exhibit expected but also surprising behaviors. However, due to the fact that in our single parameter scans only one parameter was varied at a time, while the other 9 are fixed, the generality of our conclusions is up for debate. To find the region of the 10-dimensional parameter space where the toxin-antitoxin mechanism works effectively, and to explore the joint conditions on the parameters, we randomly sample the parameter space. Random scans of multidimensional parameter spaces have previously been used in various contexts including cytoskeletal dynamics [ 31 ] and signaling cascades [ 32 ].  We run a total of 4025 simulations of the toxin-antitoxin dynamics with randomly generated parameters. The only restrictions imposed on the random parameter sampling are α m > β m and α s > β s , to make sure that average molecule numbers exceed 1 and the differential equations approach is appropriate. The algorithm generates random values for each of the 9 parameters ( g = 6 remains fixed) within the range given in Table 2 and with the aforementioned restriction, at an appropriate sampling resolution. The resolution for α m , β m , α s , β s are chosen such that the log of the ratios α m / α s and β m / β s are uniformly distributed. The sampling is therefore random and to a large degree uniform, or log-uniform.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.t002  Table 2   Parameter space being sampled and the rates of sampling.

The observations obtained by random sampling are consistent with the results of the single parameter dependence study. The results confirm that α m < α s is indeed a strong criterion for the existence of a high protein concentration peak. Fig 5(a) shows when α m / α s > 0.8 there is almost no protein concentration peak after the loss of plasmids. β m < β s is also a very important criteria, but exceptions are allowed: The protein level decreases on average when β m > β s , nevertheless, there are distinct protein concentration peaks beyond β m / β s > 1. However, the majority of the simulations with β m / β s > 1 exhibit no peaks. These exceptions could be due to some other competing effects from the dynamics of the mRNA-sRNA complex or from the dynamics of the RNA molecules.  Next, we focus on the cases that satisfy α m / α s < 0.8 and β m / β s < 4, and plot those as a function of the degradation rate of the complex β c and that of the sRNA β s . This will eliminate toxin-antitoxin dynamics with parameter combinations that are inefficient in producing a transient peak due to the criteria discussed above, allowing new effects to be discovered more easily. Fig 5(b) shows that no peaks occur for β c ≳ β s , in contrast to the rest of the region. In fact, the peaks are visually prominent only when 1.5 * β c ≲ β s . A likely explanation is as follows: when β c is low, there is a higher level of total mRNA molecules in bound form both before and after the plasmid loss. Because the DNA gene copies are removed when the plasmids are lost, the transient increase of protein synthesis is almost entirely due to the mRNA released from the complex. Therefore, the complex degradation (as opposed to mRNA degradation) is the dominant reason for total mRNA loss. At the same time, lower β c does not increase mRNA expression before plasmid loss, but merely increases the amount of bound mRNA molecules, and will therefore not lead the plasmid-containing cell to “poison itself”. If this loss of mRNA due to complex degradation is slower than the loss of sRNA (the loss of sRNA is equal to the gain of the free mRNA when the plasmids are lost), the toxic protein can be synthesized from the surplus free mRNA. Therefore, if antitoxin sRNA is less stable than the total mRNA, there will be a transient peak of mRNA, and correspondingly one for the toxic protein, after plasmid loss. However, when a higher level of free mRNA is present before plasmid loss, due to faster degradation of sRNA, i.e. when β s is large, R is in turn negatively affected. Considering this negative impact, β c ≲ β s therefore does not always guarantee high peaks, which is shown from a wide range of variations in R within this region, and there is no increase in R when β c is increasingly small compared to β s .  It is surprising that the stability of the complex plays such an important role in the toxin-antitoxin mechanism. It is secondary only to the threshold condition on the synthesis rates and the differential stability of the RNA molecules. This highlights the crucial role played by the RNA complex in the dynamics. In connection to the single parameter study conducted before, this demonstrates that the two known effects of unstable sRNA [ 26 ] and unstable RNA complexes [ 29 ] need to be understood in relation to each other and not in isolation. Unstable RNA complexes are only useful for the functioning of the toxin-antitoxin system if the sRNA is more unstable than the RNA complex.  Next, we restrict our set of parameter combinations further, by imposing β c / β s ≲ 2/3, α m / α s < 0.8 and β m / β s < 4. Fig 5(c) shows that for a prominent protein concentration peak to occur, h − / h + should not be larger than one. Projections onto β p and β m show that when β p is close to 0 there is no major peak ( Fig 5(d) ). This means that by making extremely stable toxic proteins we cannot increase the relative increase in protein concentration. It also shows generally β m < β p result in less pronounced peaks than β m > β p . This is usually satisfied in real situations, since mRNA molecules are typically less stable than proteins.  The fact that high peaks do not occur in the subregion with h − / h + > 1 tells us that the binding rate needs to be higher than the unbinding rate, i.e. the binding needs to be strong. However, it also cannot be infinitely strong, i.e. irreversible, because in that case there will be no free mRNA available for protein synthesis after plasmid loss.  Consistent with the results from the single parameter dependence study, the synthesis rate α p does not have an obvious effect on the protein concentration peak. This shows that the protein concentration peak is mostly a result of the dynamics between the mRNA, sRNA and the RNA complex, characterized for example by relations between β m and β s , α m and α s , β c and β s , and not of a high synthesis rate of the protein. This also emphasizes the importance of understanding sRNA regulation purely from the point of view of RNA dynamics instead of protein dynamics, which is traditionally viewed as playing the dominant role in cellular regulation.  To summarize, by randomly sampling the parameter space as well as performing a single parameter dependence study, we determine that the conditions for an efficient toxin-antitoxin mechanism are as follows:    The synthesis rate of mRNA should be lower than the synthesis rate of sRNA;    The degradation rate of mRNA should be relatively low, compared to the degradation rate of sRNA;    The stability of the complex should be higher than the stability of the sRNA antitoxin;    A high affinity and irreversibility (but not complete irreversibility) in RNA complex formation and some degrees of protein instability are also helping factors, but are of less significance.    Protein synthesis rate does not contribute to the forming of a transient protein concentration peak.    Despite the nonlinear nature of our system, by individually controlling the available parameters, a genetic circuit could be engineered to produce specific effects, such as a higher increase in toxin concentration after the loss of plasmids for an effective duration (from a few minutes up to an hour).    Analytical approximation to the transient protein concentration peak  Using a simplified version of the differential equations after plasmid loss, an analytical expression for the transient peak can be obtained, which qualitatively describes the dynamics. For this approximation, we assume that after the plasmid copies are lost, all mRNA molecules are immediately available in free form. That is, the number of free mRNA molecules after plasmid loss equals the sum of the mRNA steady state concentration m * and the complex steady state concentration c *. The differential equations which describe the dynamics are as follows: m  ˙  =  β  m  ·  m  p  ˙  =  α  p  ·  m  -  β  p  ·  p  .  (3) The initial conditions and integration constants required to solve the differential Eq (3) are provided by the steady state concentrations before and after the loss of plasmids, respectively. Explicit expressions for mRNA and protein concentration as a function of time can then be obtained: m  =  m  2  *  +  (  m  *  +  c  *  -  m  2  *  )  e  -  β  m  t  (4a)  p  =  p  2  *  -  (  m  *  +  c  *  -  m  2  *  )  α  p  β  m  -  β  p  e  -  β  m  t  +  (  p  *  -  p  2  *  +  (  m  *  +  c  *  -  m  2  *  )  α  p  β  m  -  β  p  )  e  -  β  p  t  ,  (4b) where m *, c * and p * are the steady state concentrations for mRNA, complex and protein before plasmid loss, and m  2  * and p  2  * are the steady state concentrations after plasmid loss (see Section “Dynamic Equations and Analytical Solution of Steady State Concentrations”). In the case that all plasmid copies are lost, the steady state concentrations m  2  * and p  2  * are both zero and the above expressions can be simplified to: m  =  m  *  e  -  β  m  t  (5a)  p  =  -  (  m  *  +  c  *  )  α  p  β  m  -  β  p  e  -  β  m  t  +  (  p  *  +  (  m  *  +  c  *  )  α  p  β  m  -  β  p  )  e  -  β  p  t  .  (5b)  These expressions qualitatively describe the transient peak of the protein concentration after plasmid loss, however the height of the peak is strongly overestimated ( Fig 6 ). In the full model, mRNA is released slowly from the complex, which reduces the peak height. This behavior can be mimicked within the approximation by the sudden release of only a fraction of the mRNAs (replacing m * by an effective mRNA concentration somewhere between m * and c *).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.g006  Fig 6   Analytical approximation of the dynamics after plasmid loss.  With the same parameter values as in Fig 2 , solution Eq (5b) gives a very large peak in approximated protein concentration (purple) compared to the actual simulated protein concentration change (green). It should be noted that this approximation considers no reaction time delay after plasmid loss.     Despite these quantitative shortcomings of the approximation, it is useful to understand some properties of the dynamics. For example, one can easily see from the solution ( Eq (5b) ), that the translation rate does not affect the peak fold-increase R , because both terms are proportional to α p , while the steady state concentration before plasmid loss, p *, is also proportional to α p . Thus, R being the ratio of the two is independent of α p . This result should also be true for the full dynamics since the analytical approximation used here is only considering the RNA dynamics and assumptions about the protein dynamics have not been made. The dependence on β m − β p is also important: An increase of this quantity is equivalent to an increase of p *, consistent with the tendency observed in the random parameter sampling ( Fig 5(d) ).    Introduction of a Competitor mRNA to Increase Toxin Levels  Regulation by small RNAs typically displays crosstalk with multiple mRNAs under the control of the same sRNA [ 33 ]. In the case of toxin-antitoxin systems, this can be exploited as an antibacterial strategy [ 15 , 16 ]. By inducing a gene encoding a competitor mRNA (on the same or another plasmid or on the chromosome) that can bind to the antitoxin sRNA and hence allows toxin mRNA to exist in free form, a similar increase in toxin concentration can be induced as with plasmid loss, which may also lead to the killing of the cell. To describe the dynamics of this scenario, the equations from above are extended to include a second type of mRNA, the competitor, and the corresponding mRNA-sRNA complex. The full dynamics is then described by the following equations: m  ˙  =  α  m  ·  g  -  β  m  ·  m  -  h  +  ·  m  ·  s  +  h  -  ·  c  s  ˙  =  α  s  ·  g  -  β  s  ·  s  -  h  +  ·  m  ·  s  +  h  -  ·  c  -  k  +  ·  m  2  ·  s  +  k  -  ·  c  2  c  ˙  =  h  +  ·  m  ·  s  -  h  -  ·  c  -  β  c  ·  c  p  ˙  =  α  p  ·  m  -  β  p  ·  p  m  ˙  2  =  α  2  ·  g  -  β  2  ·  m  2  -  k  +  ·  m  2  ·  s  +  k  -  ·  c  2  c  ˙  2  =  k  +  ·  m  2  ·  s  -  k  -  ·  c  2  -  β  c  2  ·  c  2  ,  (6) where m 2 and c 2 denote the concentrations of the competitor mRNA and the complex it forms with an sRNA molecule, respectively. k + , k − and β c 2 are the binding rate, unbinding rate and the degradation rate of this new complex.  We assume that the competitor is induced at the time t = 150 min. Then, from t = 0 to 150 min, the dynamics is the same as Eq (1) . At t = 150 min, Eq (6) are being integrated, which corresponds to the competitor gene being turned on. With zero initial concentrations for all components (at t = 150 min, new variables r = v = 0), an example simulation is shown in Fig 7 .   10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.g007  Fig 7   Introduction of a competitor mRNA.  Concentrations of sRNA, mRNA, mRNA-sRNA complex, competitor mRNA, complex formed by competitor mRNA and sRNA and protein as a function of time. Note the non-zero steady state concentrations after the triggering event resulting from the new dynamics. The parameters in Eq (6) are as follows: the first 10 parameters are the same as in Fig 4 . Parameter values for competitor mRNA are chosen from within the experimental values of mRNA synthesis rate and life time, with synthesis rate α 2 = 4.0 and degradation rate β 2 = 0.6. The competitor mRNA-sRNA complex binding and unbinding rates are k + = 60 and k − = 1.0. The competitor RNA complex degradation rate is β c 2 = 0.1. Toxin mRNA level is found to be low throughout the simulation.     A transient protein concentration peak can be observed with some specific combinations of parameters, but the majority of the simulations we run show no transient peak, as in Fig 7 . However, a non-zero steady state toxin concentration exists after induction of the competitor which can be effective in killing the host cell, since the mRNA encoding the toxic protein is still produced from the plasmid. Thus, in contrast to the case considered before, here the toxin-antitoxin system does not perform its key function in a transient dynamical fashion, but rather in the steady state, with the competitor either induced or not induced. Therefore, we define a new fold-increase parameter R  ˜ of the toxin concentration as the ratio between the steady states of the protein concentration before and after the synthesis of the competitor RNA.  Similar to the procedure in Section “Dynamic Equations and Analytical Solution of Steady State Concentrations”, the new steady state concentration for the mRNA m  2  *  ˜ turns out to be a positive root to the cubic equation: α  2  g  (  1  +  k  -  β  c  2  )  m  2  -  β  s  β  2  h  +  β  2  (  1  +  k  -  β  c  2  )  -  k  +  h  +  β  m  (  1  +  h  -  β  c  )  m  +  k  +  h  +  α  m  g  (  1  +  h  -  β  c  )   ×  -  β  m  β  s  h  +  m  2  -  β  m  (  1  +  h  -  β  c  )  m  -  (  α  s  -  α  m  -  α  2  )  g  h  +  β  s  m  +  α  m  g  (  1  +  h  -  β  c  )  =  0  (7) After algebraic manipulations, it can be written in canonical form as follows. A  m  3  +  B  m  2  +  C  m  +  D  =  0  (8) where A , B , C and D are functions of the rates. An analytical formula for the solutions of a cubic equation can always be given explicitly, but the expressions are excessively lengthy and hence not shown here. With a root finding algorithm such as the bisection method one can easily find the three roots to the cubic equation numerically. Using values similar to the experimental values, we found that even in cases where there is more than one positive root, we can still pick out the correct solution because usually one of the two positive roots corresponds to an unrealistically large concentration.  The analytical solution to Eq (7) is then compared to the numerically generated steady state concentrations after integration, and very good agreement (up to floating point error) is found. Once we obtain the steady state mRNA concentration m  2  *  ˜ , then following p  2  *  ˜  =  m  2  *  ˜  ·  α  p  /  β  p one can solve for the steady state protein concentration. The ratio p  2  *  ˜  /  p  * , where p * is given by Eq (2) , gives an analytical value for the fold-increase R  ˜ . This is how we could theoretically obtain an analytical formula for R  ˜ in the case of competitive RNA binding, which is just as effective in killing the host cell at some triggering event as the original toxin-antitoxin mechanism.  Fig 8 shows the single parameter variation response plots generated with the same method as used in Fig 4 . We observe that as soon as the synthesis of the competitor is turned on, i.e. α 2 > 0, there is a substantial fold-increase in the toxin concentration, i.e. R  ˜  >  1 . As α 2 becomes large, the increase in R  ˜ is diminished because all sRNA molecules are bound. Changing the degradation rate of the competitor mRNA β 2 results in small variation in the toxin fold-increase response R  ˜ , meaning that for the default parameter combination, there are very few free competitor mRNA molecules and most are bound in complexes. The degradation rate of the competitor mRNA-sRNA complex β c 2 positively affects R  ˜ , because it increases the destruction of the antitoxin in bound state, allowing more target mRNA to be in free form available for protein synthesis.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169703.g008  Fig 8   Dependence on the parameters of the competitor.  Each new parameter of the system is increased along the x axis. Toxic protein concentration peak fold-increase R  ˜ is plotted on the y axis for each run corresponding to the value the new parameter takes on. The default or fixed values of the parameters are the same as in Fig 7 .     The parameter variation in Fig 8 shows that the synthesis rate of the new competitor mRNA typically plays the dominant role compared to other new parameters, a general feature of cross-talk in sRNA regulation [ 33 ].     Conclusion and Summary  We have studied the toxin-antitoxin mechanism for plasmid maintenance through post-segregational killing using a theoretical model. The model extends previously studied models for sRNA-dependent regulation that have considered the limiting cases of rapid equilibrium or irreversible binding, but have thereby largely ignored the nonlinear nature of the RNA complex binding and the dynamics of the complex itself. Here we have taken the full dynamics into account and given an analytical solution for the steady state concentrations (where the plasmid copy number remains constant). We simulated the dynamics before and after plasmid loss by numerical integration and showed that the toxin-antitoxin system performs its function by inducing a transient peak in the toxin concentration, which must exceed a threshold for host killing. The formation of this peak depends on the release of the mRNA template of the protein toxin from the mRNA-sRNA complex. The accumulation of the mRNA molecules is only possible when sRNA is degraded at a faster rate than the mRNA.  We notice that the scenario of post-segregational killing of host cells that have lost the plasmid is not the only possible function of a toxin-antitoxin system of a plasmid. Our simulations of sequential loss of plasmid copies show a gradual increase of the toxin concentration without exceeding the threshold for killing. It is possible that an these sublethal toxin concentrations also contribute to plasmid maintenance: If sublethal toxin concentrations slow down growth of the host cell, this would provide additional time for plasmid replication, allowing to restore the plasmid number to the level before the loss of one or more copies. This effect is not considered in our present model, which does not included growth modulation by sublethal toxin concentrations or the control mechanism of plasmid replication, but will be studied in future work.  Using two kinds of parameter variations to study the parameter dependence of the system (individual parameter are varied in isolation, and all parameters are varied simultaneously in a random manner within a given range), we can draw a number of conclusions with regards to which ones of the 10 system parameters have significant effects on the system, and why when they take on certain ranges of values, the system functions more optimally than in other cases. In general we have found that, for an efficient toxin-antitoxin mechanism, the synthesis rate of toxin’s mRNA template should be lower than that of the sRNA antitoxin, the mRNA template should be more stable compared to the sRNA antitoxin, and the mRNA-sRNA complex should be more stable than that of the sRNA antitoxin. Analytically approximating the protein peak by allowing all mRNA to be released at once gives us an analytical expression for the peak, which despite overpredicting its height nonetheless gives qualitative insights that are consistent with previous numerical observations.  Finally, we also studied the possibility of inducing the toxic protein with a competitor mRNA, which sequesters the sRNA antitoxin. Such a mechanism has been proposed as an antibacterial strategy [ 15 , 16 ]. Here the effectiveness in killing the host cell depends on the ratio between the steady states of the toxin concentration before and after introducing the competitor RNA. An analytical solution can be given for this ratio by solving a cubic equation. We performed a single-parameter variation study for this scenario and found that the dominant parameter dependence here is on the synthesis rates. A sufficiently high synthesis rate results in all antitoxin being sequestered and the synthesis of protein toxin. In such a way the cross-talk inherent in sRNA regulation could be utilized towards inducible killing of the cells.

Obesity has been related to postural instability during static standing. It remains unknown how obesity influences stability during dynamic movements like gait. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity on dynamic gait stability control in young adults during gait. Forty-four young adults (21 normal-weight and 23 obese) participated in this study. Participants walked five times at their self-selected gait speeds on a linear walkway. Their full-body kinematics were gathered by a motion capture system. Compared with normal-weight group, individuals with obesity walked more slowly with a shorter but wider step. People with obesity also spent an elongated double stance phase than those with normal weight. A reduced gait speed decreases the body center of mass’s velocity relative to the base of support, leading to a reduction in dynamic stability. On the other hand, a shortened step in accompanying with a less backward-leaning trunk has the potential to bring the center of mass closer to the base of support, resulting in an increase in dynamic stability. As the result of these adaptive changes to the gait pattern, dynamic gait stability among people with obesity did not significantly differ from the one among people with normal weight. Obesity seems to not be inducing dynamic stability disadvantage in young adults during level overground walking. These findings could provide insight into the mechanisms of stability control among people affected by obesity during dynamic locomotion.    The authors received no specific funding for this work.

Proper balance maintenance and stability control are essential for activities of human daily living. The excessive body mass from obesity may exert adverse structural and functional effects on human body, affecting body posture and balance control [ 2 ]. Given the inherent invert-pendulum nature of the human body, the extra mass may require more effort to stabilize the body. Additionally, the greater pressure values and larger contact areas beneath the feet among people with obesity may impair the sensory capability from the plantar mechanoreceptors which is of the essence for balance control [ 3 ]. Therefore, obesity may cause an elevated postural instability [ 4 ], increasing the risk of falls and injuries among obese [ 5 ]. To date, most studies reported the postural instability characterized by the center of pressure movement on both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions during quiet standing–a typical static task [ 6 – 8 ]. Nevertheless, the majority of real-life falls happen during locomotion [ 9 ] and the stability evaluated during static condition has shown poor ability to predict future falls [ 10 ]. It is, therefore, desired to investigate what effects obesity imposes on stability control during dynamic human locomotion.  Gait variability has been applied to quantify its stability. Based on the linear (such as the standard deviations of spatiotemporal gait parameters [ 11 ]) or nonlinear dynamics (such as the maximum Floquet multipliers [ 12 ] and Lyapunov exponents [ 13 ]) theory for cyclical movement, variability in kinematics is indicative of stability. Alternatively, based on the Feasible Stability Region theory (FSR), dynamic gait stability has been proposed to quantify one’s resistance to balance loss during gait [ 14 , 15 ]. The FSR is comprised of two limits: the limit against backward balance loss and the one against forward balance loss ( Fig 1 ). These two limits encompass all possible motion states (i.e., the combination of position and velocity) of the body center of mass (COM) relative to the base of support (BOS) which ensure a person to keep the balanced upright body posture during gait. If the COM motion state is within the FSR, one is in a stable state and would preserve body balance without changing the existing BOS. When the COM motion state is below the FSR (or the limit against backward balance loss), the person is in an unstable state because the COM has no sufficient forward momentum to carry it over the BOS when its velocity diminishes. The person must take a backward recovery step to keep the body from falling backward, encountering a backward balance loss. Conversely, a person whose COM motion state is above the FSR (or the limit against forward balance loss), s/he is also in an unstable state since the COM possesses excessive forward momentum that would move the COM anteriorly beyond the BOS when its velocity becomes zero, resulting a forward balance loss. Dynamic gait stability has been identified as a more accurate predictor of falls in comparison with those indices based on gait variability [ 16 , 17 ]. Therefore, the examination of obesity’s effects on dynamic gait stability may uncover the mechanisms of obesity increasing fall risk.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169766.g001  Fig 1   The feasible stability region.  The illustration showing the feasible stability region (FSR) which is bounded by two borders: the limit against backward balance loss (the lower boundary) and the one against forward balance loss (the upper boundary). The stability measurement ( s , the length of the thin solid line) indicates the magnitude of the instantaneous stability of the center of mass (COM) against backward balance loss, and is calculated as the shortest distance from the instantaneous COM motion state (i.e., the x - and y -coordinates represents the COM anteroposterior position and velocity, respectively) to the limit against backward balance loss. Also shown is a representative COM motion state trajectory of an overground walking (the thin line) progressing from the touchdown (TD, filled circle), through the contralateral foot liftoff (LO, square), and immediately prior to the contralateral foot TD (open circle). Position and velocity of the COM relative to the base of support (BOS) are dimensionless as a fraction of l BOS and g × b h , respectively, where l BOS represents the foot length, g is gravitational acceleration, and bh the body height. When the COM motion state is outside the FSR, the person is either backward instable (below the limit against backward balance loss) or forward instable (above the limit against forward balance loss). A recovery step becomes necessary to keep the person from falling either backward or forward.     Previous studies regarding the influence of obesity on gait parameters indicated that people with obesity have a slower gait speed with a shorter but wider step and a longer double stance compared to their normal-weight counterparts [ 18 – 20 ]. Based on the FSR theory, a shortened step brings the COM closer to the BOS [ 21 ] and in turn improves the dynamic stability against backward balance loss while a reduced gait speed has the potential to deteriorate the dynamic stability [ 14 ]. The opposing effects from these two factors on the dynamic stability could nullify the influence of each likely resulting in comparable stability between normal-weight and obese individuals. Nevertheless, the exact impact of obesity on dynamic stability remains to be determined.  The primary purpose of this study was to inspect how obesity affects dynamic gait stability among young adults. Given the opposite effects of slow gait speed and short step length on dynamic gait stability, we hypothesized that people with obesity would exhibit a comparable dynamic stability during gait with their normal-weight counterparts. The findings from this study could provide insights into the influences of obesity on dynamic stability control during human gait.    Methods and Materials   Participants  Young individuals with ( n = 23) and without ( n = 21) obesity participated in this study ( Table 1 ). All participants were free of any clinically significant history of musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, orthopedic conditions, and cardiovascular conditions. They gave their written consent for participation in the study approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas at El Paso.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169766.t001  Table 1  Demographic information in mean ± standard deviation for both normal-weight (or Normal, n = 21) and obese (or Obese, n = 23) groups.

The standing width was calculated as the mediolateral distance between two heels during a static standing calibration trail.  a : Fisher’s exact test was used.    Only those who were either normal-weight or obese were enrolled into the study. A person with the body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 25 kg/m 2 was considered a normal-weight participant [ 5 ]. Whether a participant is obese was determined using two criteria. Specifically, for a male participant, his BMI must be no less than 30 kg/m 2 and the body fat percentage should be equal to or greater than 25%. For a female participant, her BMI and body fat percentage must be at least 30 kg/m 2 and 35%, respectively [ 22 ]. The bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to gauge the body fat percentage through a body composition analyzer (Tanita Corp., Japan). Such an inclusion criterion excluded overweight individuals who are between the clear obese and normal-weight participants in order to avoid any potential effects from overweight individuals on our findings.    Experimental Protocol and Data Collection  After being measured for the basic demographic information, each participant was brought to a 14-m walkway, over which they walked five times at their self-selected speed. Full body kinematics data from 26 retro-reflective markers placed on the subjects’ body were gathered using an 8-camera motion capture system (Vicon, UK) at 120 Hz. The fifth trial was selected as the representative trial for analysis.  Marker position data were low-pass filtered at marker-specific cut-off frequencies (ranging from 4.5 to 9 Hz) using fourth-order, zero-lag Butterworth filters [ 23 ]. Locations of joint centers, heels, and toes were computed from the filtered marker positions. The timing of two characteristic and transient events in each gait cycle: touchdown (TD) and liftoff (LO), was identified from the foot kinematics. Temporal measures included the double (from TD to subsequent LO of the contralateral limb) and single (from LO to the following TD at the ipsilateral foot) stance phase times and the step time (from TD to the following TD of the contralateral side). Both the double and single stance phases were also represented as a percentage of the gait cycle. The cadence was determined as the reciprocal of the step time and expressed over one minute.  Spatial measurements consisted of the step length, step width, and trunk angle. Step length was calculated as the anteroposterior distance between the two heels at their TDs. The step width was the mediolateral distance between the heels at their TDs. It was suggested that spatial parameters of gait is interfered with body height [ 23 ]. Therefore, both step length and width were normalized to body height ( bh ) [ 20 , 24 , 25 ]. The trunk angle was calculated between the trunk segment and a vertical axis in the sagittal plane. The orientation of the trunk segment was represented by a line connecting the middle point of the hips and the middle point of the shoulders. Positive trunk angle denotes that the trunk leans backward against the vertical line. The trunk angle was computed at both TD and LO. Gait speed was also calculated as the average value of the calculated instantaneous COM velocity over an entire gait cycle and was normalized to bh .  The body COM kinematics were computed using gender-dependent segmental inertial parameters [ 26 ]. The two components of the COM motion state, i.e. its position and velocity were calculated relative to the rear of BOS (i.e. the leading heel) and normalized by foot length ( l BOS ) and g × b h , respectively, where g is the gravitational acceleration. Dynamic gait stability was calculated as the shortest distance from the given COM motion state to the limit against backward balance ( Fig 1 ) [ 27 ]. The COM motion state and dynamic gait stability were calculated at instants of TD and LO.    Statistical Analysis  All statistics were performed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, NY), and a significance level of 0.05 was used throughout. Independent t -tests were used to compare the temporal and spatial parameters between the two groups: normal-weight vs. obese. Temporal parameters included the durations of single- and double-stance phases, step time, and cadence. The spatial parameters consisted of the step length, step width, gait speed, trunk angle, the COM motion state and dynamic stability at both TD and LO. The effect size (Cohen’s d ) was also calculated for each parameter to indicate the magnitude of the difference between groups.     Results  When allowed to walk at their self-selected pace, people with obesity spent longer time during the double stance phase than those with normal weight (0.204 ± 0.032 s for obese vs. 0.185 ± 0.023 s for normal-weight, p = 0.030, Cohen’s d = 0.647, Fig 2A ) while their duration of the single stance phase was comparable (0.337 ± 0.025 vs. 0.334 ± 0.020 s , p = 0.715, d = 0.112, Fig 2A ). The relative double stance phase to the gait cycle was also longer among obese than in normal-weight (18.9 ± 2.31% vs. 17.7 ± 1.42%, p = 0.050, Fig 2B ). The step time did not differ between groups (0.521 ± 0.037 vs. 0.538 ± 0.029 s , p = 0.111, d = 0.483, Fig 2B ), neither did the cadence (112.40 ± 7.12 vs. 116.10 ± 8.34 steps/min, p = 0.121, d = 0.470, Fig 3B ). Persons with obesity walked more slowly than normal-weight individuals (0.792 ± 0.098 vs. 0.895 ± 0.111 bh / s , p = 0.002, d = 0.885, Fig 3A ; or 1.352 ± 0.174 vs. 1.463 ± 0.182 m/s, p = 0.045, d = 0.602) with a shorter step length (0.411 ± 0.029 vs. 0.440 ± 0.034 bh , p = 0.004, d = 0.839, Fig 3C ) and a wider step width (0.070 ± 0.025 vs. 0.046 ± 0.017 bh , p < 0.001, d = 0.974, Fig 3D ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169766.g002  Fig 2    Group mean (column height) and standard deviation (error bar) of the elapsed time in seconds for both normal-weight (or Normal) and obese (or Obese) groups of (a) double and single stance phases and (b) the step time, defined as the duration from touchdown of one foot to the following touchdown of the contralateral foot (i.e., the sum of the single and double phases). Also shown are the percentages of the single stance and double stance with respect to the gait cycle.      10.1371/journal.pone.0169766.g003  Fig 3    Comparisons of (a) the step length, (b) cadence, (c) step width, and (d) gait speed between normal-weight and obese groups. The step length/width was calculated as the anteroposterior/mediolateral distance between two heels at their touchdowns and normalized to the body height ( bh ). The cadence was determined as the reciprocal of the step time and expressed over one minute. The gait speed was the average value of the instantaneous center of mass velocity over the entire gait cycle and normalized to bh . The center of mass velocity was calculated as the first-order derivative of the center of mass displacement with respect to time.     Participants placed their COM more forward towards the BOS in the obese group than in the normal-weight group at the beginning (i.e., at TD, -1.071 ± 0.105 vs. -1.146 ± 0.114, p = 0.028, d = 0.655, Fig 4A ) but not at the end of the stance phase (at LO, -0.165 ± 0.122 vs. -0.212 ± 0.137, p = 0.233, d = 0.363, Fig 4A ). The relative COM velocity to the BOS was slower among people with obesity compared to those with normal weight at TD (0.333 ± 0.047 vs. 0.364 ± 0.046, p = 0.035, d = 0.630, Fig 4B ) while the COM velocity did not exhibit any group-related difference at LO (0.336 ± 0.049 vs. 0.361 ± 0.050, p = 0.095, d = 0.505, Fig 4B ). The dynamic gait stability against backward balance loss did not show any difference between groups (TD: 0.067 ± 0.040 vs. 0.086 ± 0.038, p = 0.108, d = 0.486; LO: 0.274 ± 0.026 vs. 0.286 ± 0.027, p = 0.147, d = 0.440, Fig 4C ). At TD, the obese group leaned their trunk backward for 0.181 ± 3.275° from the vertical line which was marginally less than the one (1.905 ± 2.596°) among the normal-weight group ( p = 0.061, d = 0.563). The trunk angle was alike between groups at LO (2.153 ± 3.623 vs. 3.698 ± 2.875°, p = 0.127, d = 0.462, Fig 5 ). All original data was provided in the supporting file ( S1 File ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169766.g004  Fig 4    Comparisons of (a) the center of mass (COM) position, (b) COM velocity, and (c) COM stability at two transient gait events (touchdown or TD and liftoff or LO) between normal-weight and obese groups. Both the COM position and velocity were relative to the rear edge of the base of support (BOS) and respectively normalized by foot length ( l BOS ) and g × b h , where g represents the gravitational acceleration and bh the body height. Stability is calculated as the shortest distance from the given COM motion state (i.e. its position and velocity) and the computer-predicted boundary against backward balance loss ( Fig 1 ).      10.1371/journal.pone.0169766.g005  Fig 5   The comparison of the trunk angle at two transient gait events (touchdown or TD and liftoff or LO) between normal-weight and obese groups.  Trunk angle was calculated between the trunk segment and a vertical axis. Positive trunk angle represents that the trunk leans backward against the vertical line while zero means the trunk is in a neutral position which aligns perfectly with the vertical axis.       Discussion  This study sought to determine how obesity affects dynamic stability during gait among young adults. Our results indicated that people with obesity walked more slowly, with a shorter but wider step, and elongated double stance phase in comparison with normal-weight people when they had the option of walking at a self-chosen gait speed. As a result of these adaptive changes to the gait pattern, people with obesity displayed similar dynamic gait stability to those with normal weight, which supported our hypothesis.  Consistent with previous findings [ 18 – 20 ], people with obesity in the present study demonstrated a slower self-selected gait speed, a shorter step length, a wider step width, accompanied by a prolonged double stance phase (Figs 2 and 3 ). Except the step width, other adaptive changes to the gait pattern exhibited in the obese group have been linked to the attempt of reducing energetic costs [ 28 ]. It was suggested that the preferred gait variables were chosen by obese young adults to minimize their mechanical work required to transfer the excessive body mass [ 28 ]. This was supported by another study indicating that both obese and normal-weight individuals preferred to walk at speeds where the gross energy cost per distance was minimized [ 19 ]. To move the excessive body mass, people with obesity may choose a slower gait speed as a strategy to expend possibly minimal energy. Particularly, the slow walking speed reduces the mechanical work demanded to redirect the COM of forward or upward movements during gait. In the current study, individuals with obesity do not reduce the step frequency but step length to slow the gait speed ( Fig 3 ), which confirms previous findings [ 29 ]. A possible explanation from the energy efficiency perspective could be that a shorter step may dissipate less energy and reduce the energy expenditure [ 30 ].  These modifications to the gait spatiotemporal parameters, which have previously been reported as safety-related adaptations [ 31 ], are indications of the “cautious gait” used by obese participants. These adaptive gait pattern changes were also suggested being indicative of reaction to maintain dynamic stability during gait [ 19 ]. A slow gait speed possibly allows people with obesity a more controlled gait pattern in order to maintain dynamic balance. There could be other factors contributing to the slow gait speed among people with obesity. First, obese individuals generally experience lower muscle strengths than their normal-weight counterparts when adjusting for body mass [ 32 ]. The relative muscle weakness in people with obesity could result in slow gait speed [ 33 ]. Second, the degraded plantar sole sensitivity level among the obese may delay the detection of external perturbations and elevate the risk of experiencing an actual fall should a perturbation occur. A secure and more controlled gait pattern would allow more time for sensory exploration, attenuate the sensation of uncertainty, and potentially reduce the severity of any possible perturbations. Thus, the cautious gait pattern also compensates, to some extent, the sole sensory impairments in obese [ 3 ].  In terms of the FSR theory, a reduced gait speed, leading to a decreased COM velocity relative to the BOS, would compromise dynamic gait stability in people with obesity [ 27 ]. To compensate such a negative influence on stability from the reduced gait speed, people with obesity adopted a short step during walking. They shortened their step length by approximately 6% in comparison with their normal-weight counterparts ( Fig 3A ). It has been found that a reduced step length, which shifts body COM anteriorly and close to the BOS, improves stability against backward falls [ 21 ]. When the COM is close to the BOS, less forward momentum is required to enable the COM to catch BOS in order to keep body balance [ 34 ]. Therefore, the anteriorly-shifted COM will counter the reduction in stability resulting from the slow COM velocity.  The modification in participants’ COM position was also achieved by reducing the backward trunk lean ( Fig 5 ). Less trunk backward inclination further shifts the COM forward [ 21 , 34 ] given that the HAT (head, arm, and trunk) segment contains about two thirds of the total body mass. Such an effect would be magnified by the excess HAT segment mass in people with obesity. The anterior shift of COM could reduce the required COM velocity and warrant the dynamic stability against backward balance loss [ 34 ].  A healthy gait pattern is governed by the central nervous system for both economy and stability. A previous study has proposed that the metabolic rate and mechanical efficiency are comparable between obese and normal-weight groups when allowed to walk at self-selected gait speed [ 28 ]. Another study seconded this finding by showing that no significant difference in the external work-per-unit mass was detected between obese and normal-weight groups when walking at a comfortable gait speed [ 35 ]. The present study further demonstrated that people with obesity demonstrate similar dynamic stability during gait to those with normal weight ( Fig 4C ). People with obesity adaptively changed their gait pattern in response to the excessive gait mass in order to minimize the metabolic cost and to sustain dynamic stability. Therefore, the central nervous system regulates the obese gait to be economically and mechanically comparable with the non-obese gait.  Despite studies which pointed out that obesity could reduce the static stability quantified by the postural sway when standing on force plates, obesity seems not affecting the dynamic stability during gait when subjects are allowed to walk at their preferred speeds. Given that the bipedal human motion is inherently instable due to its multi-link inverted pendulum structure [ 36 ], the control of stability is essentially a matter of regulating the relative motion between the COM and its BOS [ 37 ]. During static tasks like quiet standing, the relative position between the COM and BOS plays the dominant role in controlling balance [ 37 ]. To keep the body balanced, one needs to keep the projection of the COM within the BOS. As aforementioned, obese individuals possess excessive body mass with relatively weak muscle strength [ 33 ]. Thus, people with obesity may encounter difficulties in confining the body’s sway within a range which is as small as among normal-weight individuals. As a result, obese individuals exhibit a greater body sway–the indicator of postural instability. In contrast, the regulation of the relationship between COM and BOS in gait is highly complex because the BOS and the COM are in constant motion with the BOS changing its size. It has been reported that a person controls simultaneously the COM position and velocity relative to the BOS in order to avoid a balance loss during gait [ 14 , 15 ]. Therefore, two dimensions (i.e., the position and velocity) of two elements (i.e., the COM and BOS), or more degrees of freedom than static situation, could be manipulated to maintain dynamic stability. In the present study, people with obesity adopted a slower speed to reduce the COM velocity relative to the BOS and a shorter step length and less backward-leaning trunk to bring the COM closer to the BOS than those with normal weight. The dynamic stability did not demonstrate any significant difference between groups. Those adaptive changes to the gait pattern could be considered actions to maintain gait stability in obese individuals [ 19 ].  In line with previous ones [ 18 – 20 ], the current study found adaptive changes to the gait pattern among people with obesity, such as the reduced gait speed, shortened step length, widened step width, and prolonged double stance phase. The dependency relationship of spatial gait parameters upon gait speed was reported previously. For example, when one slows the gait velocity, a shorter step would be taken [ 38 ]. It was suggested that people with obesity tend to walk slowly to preserve dynamic balance [ 19 ]. Therefore, a question may rise: are other changes detected in the current study also solely owning to obesity or the secondary (or compensatory) outcomes of the slow speed? To answer this question, more systematical and comprehensive studies using biomechanical and physiological approaches are essential.  Several limitations were presented in this study. First, the walking condition involved in this study was normal overground walking. As most falls are initiated by external perturbations (such as slips or trips), it is unknown if the finding from this study can be applied to a perturbed walking condition. Second, the sample size was small. This could partially explain the non-significant difference in few parameters including the cadence ( Fig 3B ) and trunk angle at TD ( Fig 5 ) although they exhibited a close to moderate effect size. Third, the COM kinematics calculation was based on the same segmental inertial parameters for both groups [ 26 ]. This system may not account for the potential anterior shift of the COM due to the additional abdominal fat in obese [ 39 ]. However, the current calculation of the COM position for the individuals with obesity was a conservative estimation. If appropriate adjustments were made to the COM kinematics calculation among obese, the COM would be more anteriorly shifted than the current values, which would still be in favor of our findings. Fourth, obesity could impact human body stability on both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions [ 6 – 8 ]. Although the present study examined the impact of obesity on dynamic stability control in the sagittal plane, it is unknown how dynamic stability behaves on the frontal plane in people with obesity. Fifth, the physical activity level was not controlled well between groups in this study. It is possible that the physical activity level could be a confounder influencing our findings. Last, some parameters, such as the waist to hip ratio and abdominal circumference were not measured in the present study, which limit our ability of determining the fat distribution type and its potential influences on our findings. All issues deserve further investigations.  In summary, this study advanced the examination of stability control from a static condition to a dynamic one among people with obesity. Our results revealed that people with obesity have similar dynamic stability during gait as those with normal weight. The comparable dynamic stability is the compounding effects of the reduced gait speed and shortened step length along with a less backward-leaning trunk segment among the obese group than the normal-weight group. The findings of this study could be of importance to examine the control of dynamic stability among people with obesity.

Car following (CF) models used in traffic engineering are often criticized for not incorporating “human factors” well known to affect driving. Some recent work has addressed this by augmenting the CF models with the Task-Capability Interface (TCI) model, by dynamically changing driving parameters as function of driver capability. We examined assumptions of these models experimentally using a self-paced visual occlusion paradigm in a simulated car following task. The results show strong, approximately one-to-one, correspondence between occlusion duration and increase in time headway. The correspondence was found between subjects and within subjects, on aggregate and individual sample level. The long time scale aggregate results support TCI-CF models that assume a linear increase in time headway in response to increased distraction. The short time scale individual sample level results suggest that drivers also adapt their visual sampling in response to transient changes in time headway, a mechanism which isn’t incorporated in the current models.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005877  Luonnontieteiden ja Tekniikan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta    279905   http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6974-8760  Jami Pekkanen        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005877  Luonnontieteiden ja Tekniikan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta    279827   Teemu H.

But even if distraction is often involved in the occurrence of a crash, clearly the vast majority of all episodes of momentary distraction on the road do not cause an accident. Although in some cases this may be sheer luck, most of the time the drivers’ ability to adapt their attention and behavior for a given situation ensures successful driving with only partial sensory and cognitive resources. Studies have shown that drivers successfully balance the attentional resources between driving and a secondary tasks using compensatory behavior, e.g. lowering driving speed or pausing conversation in a demanding driving situation [ 2 – 4 ].  Within traffic psychology, the question of how this mechanism works has been subject of extensive discussion for decades (for review of the history see [ 5 ] Chapter Two). Much of the debate has revolved around a subjective estimate, or feeling, of risk , and how drivers balance their different goals to keep the risk at acceptable levels. However, the risk-based formulations have proven quite problematic to state in quantitative form. An influential model arisen from this discussion is the task-capability interface (TCI) of Fuller [ 6 ], which reframes this balance as task-difficulty homeostasis : Drivers maintain a preferred level of task difficulty which is a difference between task demand and capability . Importantly for the purposes of quantitative modeling, sidestepping the problematic issue of risk makes the theory more amenable to operationalization.  Although well established in traffic psychology, these mechanisms have traditionally been overlooked by most car following models in traffic engineering, which has raised considerable criticism [ 7 – 9 ] (for a review of human factors in CF models see [ 10 ]). As a response to this criticism, the TCI has recently been incorporated in car following models by Hoogendoorn et al. [ 11 ] and Saifuzzaman et al. [ 12 ]. Both propose that parameters of car following vary as functions of driver capability, so as to maintain the task difficulty at a peferred level. For example, a drop in driver capability due to distraction causes their preferred time headway to the leading vehicle to rise, which lowers the task’s demand and thus maintains a preferred level of task difficulty. However, neither proposal includes an operationalization for capability, and thus lack a direct quantitative validation of the TCI formulation.  Time headway provides quite a natural index for task demand in a car following task. It’s often discussed as the main variable drivers control during car following, and has been shown in multiple studies to increase as capability drops [ 6 ]. Time headway is also directly measurable and a central measure in traffic engineering.  For driver capability , however, such natural operationalization is not as readily found. Fuller [ 6 ] considers capability to consist of various elements. The “upper limit” of capability, or competence, is a result of multitude of biological and acquired characteristics, such as motor coordination, information processing capacity and understanding of traffic dynamics through driving experience and training. The actual capability in any given situation is affected also by more transient aspects such as fatigue, motivation and distraction.  In experimental settings driver capability is generally manipulated using a distracting secondary task. Due to obvious road safety implications, the tasks are often naturalistic ones, such as mobile phone handling or usage of in-vehicle navigation systems [ 2 ]. But like capability, distraction consists of multiple kinds of phenomena, often divided to visual distraction (“eyes-off-the-road”), cognitive distraction (“mind-off-the-road”) and manual distraction (“hands-off-the-wheel”) [ 13 ]. Naturalistic tasks tend to blend some or all of these, which makes them rather difficult to identify and isolate for rigorous analysis. In order to directly operationalize distraction, we focus on the visual distraction using the occlusion method , where the driver’s field of view is occluded unless they make a glance by briefly removing the occlusion. This paradigm has a long history in driver behavior research, although it has been used almost exclusively in investigating steering tasks with emphasis on lateral control [ 14 – 17 ].  In sum, to directly measure time headway (task demand) and visual sampling (capability), we developed a driving simulator setting for a car following task, with “eyes-off-the-road” distraction simulated using the occlusion method. The data is used to experimentally examine the assumptions of Hoogendoorn et al. [ 11 ] and Saifuzzaman et al. [ 10 ]. The results are also discussed in terms of how quantitative behavioral data from simulated and real driving can be incorporated into the current car following models in engineering—and to provide a more solid footing for theoretical ideas in traffic psychology.    Methods   Participants  A convenience sample of 18 subjects (9 M, 9 F, age 21 y–35 y, mean 26 y) participated in the study. The participants had held a driving license for an average of 7.6 years (SD 4.1 years), including 2 participants with no driving license. Participants were recruited through personal contacts and university mailing lists.  An informed consent to participate was obtained electronically from each participant as part of the questionnaire. This was done, in accordance with the instructions of the ethics committee, in the form of a fixed-format consent form explaining the purpose of the study, the procedure, and intended use of the data (for scientific purposes only). The study was conducted following the research ethical guidelines of Finnish National Advisory Board on Research Ethics and Helsinki Ethical Review Board in the Humanities and Social and Behavioural Sciences. As per the guidelines, ethical review for the experiment was waived, as the experiment didn’t include any of the criteria that warrant for ethical review. Apart from e-mail address, no identifying information was gathered in the study. The e-mail addresses were removed from the data set by JP in the first step of preprocessing and were stored only on the data logging computer and JP’s workstation.    Driving simulator  The driving simulator software was developed in-house and is available under an open source license [ 18 ]. The experiment was run in a fixed based simulator set-up, comprising of a 46 inch display (Sony KDL-46EX653), a distance-adjustable gaming chair (Playseat Evolution Alcantara, Playseats B.V., The Netherlands) and a steering wheel game controller (Logitech G25, Logitech, Fremont, CA). The steering wheel and the gaming chair were in line with the horizontal mid point of the screen, and the vertical mid-point (virtual horizon) was approximately at the eye height (the chair had no height adjustment, so the exact eye height varied with the size of the participant). The viewing distance was about 75–85 cm (depending on the distance adjustment preference of the participant and how upright they would sit), giving the participants a vertical field of about 60–70 degrees (see Fig 1 ). The simulation was rendered at 1920x1080 pixel resolution targeting 60Hz frame rate with a virtual camera projection configured to have a 65 degree vertical field of view.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169704.g001  Fig 1   The physical setup of the driving simulator.     The simulated vehicle dynamics parameters were decided by informal pilot testing to give a comfortable compromise of good controllability but not overly nervous responses. For detailed parametrization, see [ 18 ] tag v1.1, file vehicle.ls. Steering was disabled in all tasks and the participants only controlled the vehicle’s speed with gas and brake pedals.    Procedure  Online version of the experiment is available at https://jampekka.github.io/attadapt-demo/ . Apart from using keyboard controls, the online version is identical with what was used in our laboratory experiments.  Each session started with obtaining an informed consent and background information with a computer-based questionnaire. This was followed by four different tutorial scenarios simulating basic speed control subtasks, which allowed the participant to learn the simulator’s controls, virtual vehicle dynamics and dimensions and controlling the speed. The tutorial scenarios were added as an effort to minimize learning effects in the final trials that were analyzed. After the tutorial scenarios, two successful practice trials of unoccluded following task and occluded following task were run. If there was a crash or the participant ran the traffic light signaling beginning of the trial, the practice trials were retried until there was two successful runs, or five trials in total. These were followed by four trials of both tasks in randomized order.  The instruction for the unoccluded following task ( Fig 2 left panel) was to minimize the fuel consumption while driving behind the car ahead. The fuel consumption instruction was chosen to avoid excessive accelerations and decelerations not usually observed in normal driving. However, to promote shorter time gaps, a “draft saving” element was included where the consumption decreased as a function of the distance to the lead vehicle. Meters displaying landspeed and average and instantaneous consumption were shown throughout the tasks. In the normal following task, a draft saving percentage was also shown. For the occluded task this was replaced with number of glances. Draft saving was not shown during the occluded task, as it could be used to deduce the distance to the following vehicle.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169704.g002  Fig 2   Screenshots of unoccluded car following (left) and occluded car following (right).  In the occluded car following scenario the driver could request a visual sample of 300 ms by pressing a paddle in the steering wheel controller.     In the occluded car following task, a black rectangle ( Fig 2 , right panel) was placed as an occlusion so that it masked the driver’s own lane and the position of the leading vehicle. The participant could “lift” the occlusion by pressing a lever in the steering wheel, after which the mask was removed for a 300 ms “glance”, after which the occlusion returned. The participants were instructed to minimize fuel consumption as in the normal task, but with minimal number of occlusion removals (glances). No explicit weighting was given for the fuel consumption and the number of glances.  The leading vehicle drove with a randomized speed profile, where a target speed was randomly sampled (without replacement) every ten seconds from a set of 0, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 km/h. The leading vehicle accelerated or decelerated to this speed using a simple proportional control algorithm ( Fig 3 ). The trial ended when the player had progressed 2000 meters.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169704.g003  Fig 3   Sample trials of the occluded car following task, showing the speed profile of the the leading vehicle (dashed black line) and the participant’s vehicle (solid blue line).  The vertical lines at the bottom represent the glance onset times, points in time when the participant requested a visual sample by removing the occlusion. The shaded areas, corresponding to the first and last 300 meters in distance, were omitted from the analysis. The sample runs are, from top to bottom, 25th, 50th and 75th percentile by average time gap.       Data preprocessing and analysis  The data analysis was done using custom Python scripts which, along with the data, are available under an open source license [ 19 ].  The first 300 meters of driving was omitted from the analysis to discard the initial acceleration from standstill, and the last 300 meters were omitted as some of the participants “strategically” coasted to the end of the trial when they saw the finish line approaching ( Fig 3 ). The somewhat arbitrary criteria of 300 meters on both ends was decided upon visual inspection of the individual trial time series. To prevent very high time gap values, samples where ground speed was under 1.0 m/s were omitted.    Modeling assumptions  Both Hoogendoorn et al. [ 11 ] and Saifuzzaman et al. [ 12 ] assume a relationship between driver capability and preferred time headway. We assume that a driver’s preferred time headway  T ′( t ) can be reasonably estimated as a geometric mean of the time headway time series: T  ′  (  t  )  ≈  T  ^  (  t  ) . In the between-subjects analyses we use per-subject differences of average time headway in the occluded tasks and unoccluded tasks: Δ  T  ^  ≡  T  ^  D  -  T  ^  0 , where T  ^  0 is occluded average and T  ^  D is unoccluded average.  Both articles leave open how to operationalize the capability C ( t ). We assume that capability is inversely related to distraction: C  (  t  )  =  (  S  (  t  )  +  C  0  -  1  )  -  1 , where C 0 is “base capability”, ie capability when distraction S ( t ) is zero. We further propose that in our experiment, the geometric mean of occlusion durations approximates driver’s average (visual) distraction: S  ^  (  t  )  ≈  o  ^  (  t  ) .  Hoogendoorn et al. [ 11 ] formulate task difficulty as m d ( t ) = m t ( t ) − m c ( t ), where m t ( t ) is task demand and m c ( t ) is driver capability. In their model, the preferred time headway increases as a function of task difficulty and “default time headway” T  H  ′ as: T  ′  (  t  )  =  T  H  ′  (  m  d  (  t  )  3  +  1  ) . It is not immediately obvious to us how to quantitatively formulate this in terms of occlusion durations, but it seems to imply that the increase in time headway due to distraction is relative to the headway in the unoccluded task. Thus we assume that Hoogendoorn et al. [ 11 ] qualitatively implies a “baseline relative” relationship: Δ  T  ^  D  /  T  ^  0  ∼  o  ^  D  .  The formulation of Saifuzzaman et al. [ 12 ] doesn’t include an explicit driver capability term, but they assume that “driver capability is inversely proportional to driver’s desired time headway selection”. We interpret this as T  ^  (  t  )  ≈  c  C  ^  (  t  )  -  1 , where C  ^  (  t  ) is average capacity in some neighborhood of t and c is some constant. This results in a relationship between the physical quantities average occlusion duration and average time headway: T  ^  (  t  )  ≈  c  (  o  ^  (  t  )  +  C  0  -  1  ) . Assuming that distraction is zero in the normal following task leads further to: T  ^  (  t  )  ≈  c  o  ^  (  t  )  +  T  ^  0  . Thus an increase in time headway is directly proportional to increase in occlusion duration: Δ  T  ^  ≈  c  o  ^  D . More generally, and in contrast to Hoogendoorn et al. [ 11 ], this implies “baseline independent” relationship: Δ  T  ^  ∼  o  ^  D  .     Results   Average occlusion duration and time headway  As discussed in the methods, we interpret that Hoogendoorn et al. [ 11 ] proposes “baseline relative” relationship, Δ  T  ^  /  T  ^  0  ∼  o  ^ , where increase in time headway due to visual distraction depends on the time headway on non-distracted “baseline” task, whereas Saifuzzaman et al. [ 12 ] is interpreted to assume “baseline independent” relationship, where time headway increase is only a function of the visual distraction.  In our data, the “baseline independent” relationship between average time headway and average occlusion duration yields a Spearman correlation of 0.84 (95% CI (0.62, 0.94)) whereas the “baseline relative” yields a lower correlation of 0.57 (95% CI (0.14, 0.82)). The difference has 95% CI of (0.026, 0.66) (using method of Zou [ 20 ]), indicating that the “baseline independent” formulation results in a significantly stronger qualitative relationship.  Further studying the relationship Δ  T  ^  ∼  o  ^  D shows it to be quite linear, with the geometric average occlusion duration o  ^  D explaining 84% of variance of the geometric average time headway ( Fig 4 ). Furthermore, the “trivial” case of Δ  T  ^  =  o  ^  D cannot be ruled out on 95% confidence level, which quantitatively corroborates the formulation T  ^  (  t  )  ≈  c  o  ^  (  t  )  +  T  ^  0 , with c ≈ 1, ie that average time headway increases in approximately one-to-one wrt. average occlusion duration.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169704.g004  Fig 4   Time headway increase in occluded driving relative to unoccluded car following, as a function of the participant’s average occlusion duration.  Each dot indicates an individual participant. When the occlusion task is introduced to the experiment, the participants leave a longer time headway and the individual participants choose idiosyncratic “trade offs” between leaving more headway vs. requesting samples. At a group level, however, the trade off is well described by a linear relation (solid black line). The case of time headway increase being equal to the glance duration (dashed black line) can not be ruled out on 95% confidence level (gray shaded area).     However, it should be noted that the choice of the particular form of T  ^  D  -  T  ^  0  ≈  α  o  ^  +  α  0 is somewhat arbitrary, and selected largely due to simplicity and compatibility with previous modeling efforts. All of the variables in the equation correlate rather strongly with each other ( Fig 5 ), making model selection underdetermined by data alone.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169704.g005  Fig 5   Per-subject geometric means of unoccluded time headway T  ^  0 , occluded time headway T  ^  D and occlusion duration o  ^  D .     With these caveats, based on our results, we propose that T  ^  (  t  )  ≈  T  ^  0  +  o  ^  (  t  ) can be used as a reasonable approximation for preferred time gap under “eyes-off-the-road” type visual distraction. The estimate for unoccluded preferred time gap T  ^  0  ≈  T  ′ has quite substantial between-subject variation ( Fig 5 ), but as a first approximation one second could be used.    Instantaneous Time Headway and Occlusion Duration  To further study the relationship between time headway and occlusion duration at within-subject and within-trial level, we sample both signals only at “glance onset moments” t g , ie time instances where the subject lifts the blinder. At such sampled signal, occlusion duration o ( t g ) measure how long the subject chooses to drive without visual input after the glance and “instantaneous time headway” T ( t g ) measure time gaps at the glance onset moments ( Fig 6 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169704.g006  Fig 6   Sample time series showing time headway and next occlusion duration at glance onset moments.  The sample runs are, from top to bottom, 25th, 50th and 75th percentile by Spearman correlation between the detrended instantaneous time gaps and occlusion durations.     To reduce possible spurious relationship due to within-subject and within-trial variation in the preferred time gap T ′( t ) and preferred glance interval o ′( t ), we subtract a robust linear trends T  ˜  (  t  g  ) and o  ˜  (  t  g  ) from both signals, resulting in T  d  (  t  g  )  =  T  (  t  g  )  -  T  ˜  (  t  g  ) and o  d  (  t  g  )  =  o  (  t  g  )  -  o  ˜  (  t  g  )  We find a robust qualitative relationship between time headway and occlusion duration also for these instantaneous values. From a total of 61 trials, 58 had a positive T d ( t g ) ∼ o d ( t g ) Spearman correlation (Binomial test p = 3.3 × 10 −14 ). The relationship was also consistent between subjects: for all 18 subjects the median correlation of the trials was positive (Binomial test p = 7.6 × 10 −6 ). The relationship is also rather strong: the overall median Spearman correlation was 0.56 and median of subject medians was 0.57.  As neither of the variables are under experimental control and the order of causation is unclear, we use an “error-in-variables” type symmetric regression for parameter estimates to avoid bias due to regression attenuation. Furthermore, as the error variances in the variables aren’t known, we opt for the non-parametric and symmetric Passing-Bablok regression [ 21 ].  Per-subject Passing-Bablok regressions show some variation in the slope, with the median at 0.83 ( Fig 7 ). Intercepts are naturally quite close to zero (median -0.05) due to the detrending.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169704.g007  Fig 7   Per-subject Passing-Bablok regression estimates between detrended instantaneous time headways and occlusion durations, with median of each subject’s trend added back to predicted values.  Regression line x-axis range for each subject is from 25th to 75th percentile.     Based on visual inspection of the time series ( Fig 6 ), and the correlation surviving the detrending, we posit that this correspondence between the time headways and occlusion durations occurs on a rather short timescale, on the order of seconds. We propose that on this short time scale the covariation is mostly due to the driver momentarily adapting their task capability to the situation’s demands, ie when the time gap is large/small, the driver can have their “eyes off the road” for a longer/shorter duration.  Assuming this direction of causality, the result suggests that g d ( t ) ≈ βT d ( t ), with β typically around 1.0, could be used as a crude approximation of how an average driver adapts visual sampling to transient changes in time headway. Assuming that the linear trends of time gap and inter glance interval approximates the between subjects and longer timescale preferences time headway T  ′  (  t  )  ≈  T  ˜  (  t  ) and occlusion durations o  ′  (  t  )  ≈  o  ˜  (  t  ) , this can be further expanded: o  (  t  )  -  o  ′  (  t  )  ≈  β  (  T  (  t  )  -  T  ′  (  t  )  )  o  (  t  )  ≈  β  (  T  (  t  )  -  T  ′  (  t  )  )  +  o  ′  (  t  )  .     Discussion  In summary, our data shows a robust and strong relationship between the time headway to the leading vehicle and the accepted occlusion duration. This dependency is present across different levels of time-scale, and at between-subjects and within-subject levels.  Our interpretation is that the different time scales may reflect slightly different processes, at different levels of hierarchical analysis of the driving task [ 22 ]. The between-subjects dependency at longer time scale may reflect a “strategic” or “tactical” individual preference in setting their desired headway or glance interval, i.e. the trade-off between achieving the instructed intermittency of visual updating while maintaining sufficient control of safety margins. The within-subject dependency at the shorter time-scale may in turn may reflect “operational” level feedback responses to unpredictable changes in the leading vehicle speed. If the leading vehicle slows down (especially during occlusion) and thereby ends up closer than desired, the driver increases visual sampling frequency as they slow down. If, on the other hand, the leading vehicle accelerates rapidly the time headway will increase, and there is less need for visual sampling and the occlusion duration will increase.  In addition to showing the existence of the relationships, we provided tentative approximations of their quantitative forms. The approximations, although subject to various limitations, can hopefully be utilized in traffic safety policy discussion, quantitative modeling of driver behavior, and importantly as null hypotheses to be challenged and refined in future work.   Limitations   Ecological validity of the simulator  Simulator based results are naturally subject to the many general problems of how well a simulator replicates real-world driving tasks [ 23 ]. Some discrepancies are already apparent: the typical time gaps in the normal following task were somewhat smaller than are found in real-world measurements. There are some deliberately made choices in the task that are expected to yield smaller time gaps: the subjects were encouraged to drive with small time gaps, the task didn’t include steering, the lead vehicle’s decelerations were quite subtle and the structure of the road environment was extremely simple. But there is also quite a clear reason to believe that driving was significantly more “risky” than it would be with a real car: from the total of 144 trials 9 ended with a crash, which would translate to about 31000 crashes per 100 million kilometers driven, which is of course several magnitudes higher than real world traffic accident rates; the 2014 finnish rate of accidents ending in insurance claims was about 170 accidents per 100 million kilometers driven [ 24 ].  Also the instruction used, minimizing fuel consumption, is somewhat unconventional. We opted for this instruction based on pilot testing, where instruction to drive with minimal (time) headway often led to a “racing game like” driving, with unrealistically high accelerations, and the common instruction “drive as you normally would” led to very long headways, which would be problematic with our modeling assumption that the participants drove with very low distraction levels ( C  0  -  1 ) in the normal following task. The “fuel consumption” framing of the task instruction was deemed a satisfactory way to instigate optimizing behavior without encouraging aggressive driving. However, the instruction does cause an extra component for the participants to monitor and control, which may somewhat change the dynamics of the task in comparison to normal real-world driving.  Examining ecological validity of the results with real-world driving experiment is important future work. Fortunately this should be relatively straightforward as the methological foundations are already laid in previous visual occlusion studies.    Occlusion duration as index of distraction  The occlusion paradigm has favorable methodological properties, but of course the dynamics of distraction and capability in the real world are much more complex. Attention during driving isn’t only about taking visual input in discrete time intervals. Many, or even most, types of distraction, such as drowsiness or secondary tasks have significant or even dominating cognitive distraction component, ie the eyes may well be in the road ahead, yet the information is not sufficiently processed or reacted to.    Non-representative sample of participants  Our convenience sample of participants clearly are not a representative sample of drivers: they were significantly younger than the general driving population and all didn’t even have a driving license. This naturally brings about concerns about the generalizability of the quantitative results, but the robustness of the results is quite a strong indication that they should generalize to the general population at least on a qualitative level. We also conducted time headway analyses using difference from the unoccluded task ( Δ  T  ^ ), which we assume will generalize better than absolute time headway values.    Simplistic parameterization of task demand  In our analyses, task demand is operationalized only as function of time headway. Quite obviously, this doesn’t capture the entirety of a driving task’s demands, even in the extremely reduced car following task used in our experiment. The rather strong results in between-subject analyses indicate that when averaged over long spans of driving, time headway seems to index task demand quite well, if measured by frequency of glances.  The instantaneous case, while statistically quite robust, leaves plenty of variation to be explained. Also we use non-parametric methods for analyses of the instantaneous case, which leaves open the distributional characteristics of the unexplained variation. More accurate account of how the task demand varies as a function of the driving situation is clearly needed for realistic modeling of the demand-capability dynamics.      Conclusions  On qualitative level the results support both Hoogendoorn et al. [ 11 ] and Saifuzzaman et al. [ 12 ] in that average time headway significantly changes in response to distraction, but the latter better explains our observations. Furthermore their proposal “driver capability is inversely proportional to driver’s desired time headway selection” interpreted as T  ^  (  t  )  ≈  c  C  ^  (  t  )  -  1 explains our data remarkably well when the average capability is operationalized using the average occlusion duration and unoccluded driving performance: C  ^  (  t  )  ≈  (  o  ^  (  t  )  +  T  ^  0  )  -  1 .  However, we also find that there’s similar relationship in the shorter, non-averaged, timescale. We propose that this is largely due to drivers adapting their momentary visual attention to fluctuations in task demand due to momentary deviations from the “desired time gap”. Such adaptive attention is observed in everyday experience and in large scale field studies [ 3 , 25 ]. This kind of adaptation isn’t incorporated in the discussed TCI-CF models, and more generally majority of existing car following models effectively assume constant, or slowly changing, monitoring and vigilance.  The traffic simulator HUTSim does include a CF model where the update rate of the model is reduced during periods of uneventful driving, which can lead to collisions or near-collisions [ 26 ]. Yang et al. [ 27 ] developed a car following model in which the modeled driver reaction time fluctuates as a result of distraction, with intermitted sampling, or “eyes-off-the-road” distraction as one component. Przybyla et al. [ 28 ] developed methodology to indirectly estimate driver distraction using reaction times from naturalistic data. Our data and results provide experimental insight for evaluating such models, and bridging them with the TCI and adaptive time headway models based on it.  The occlusion paradigm may prove to be useful setting for providing more rigorous operationalizations for traffic psychological theories. In fact our assumptions do imply such operationalizations for the TCI: at least in a simplified car following task, capability and task demand are operationalized as inverse of seconds, with occlusion duration and time headway providing measurable estimates. The close connection between the occlusion duration and time headway can also provide a tool to operationalize more complex distractions, which could be estimated by their effect on the driving performance.  However, the TCI, while elegant yet explaining variety of phenomena, is rather coarse view of driver behavior. Deeper understanding of the driving process and more general models will undoubtedly require refining what high level constructs like task demand and capability “are made of” [ 29 ]. Although the TCI forwarded common ground between previously seemingly conflicting ideas, the theoretical and experimental work of understanding the mechanisms underneath is far from finished [ 23 ].  In the experimental field, the occlusion paradigm, especially in the short time scale, could also provide a bridge between research in speed control and steering, which are currently somewhat separate fields of inquiry. The connection to previous occlusion studies, concerning mostly lateral control (steering) [ 14 – 17 ], is readily apparent. This connection might prove fruitful in bringing the models of visual control of an automobile [ 30 – 33 ] (for review see [ 34 ]) closer to traffic engineering car following models. It would therefore be desirable to extend the current paradigm and modeling efforts to more complex scenarios involving both lateral and longitudinal control on curved roads with more visual 3D structure. Concretely combining insights in various fields of traffic psychology and traffic engineering would surely help in moving towards a quantitative and general model of driver behavior.

Background  Although cognitive impairment is not a consistent feature of multiple system atrophy (MSA), increasing evidence suggests that cognitive impairment is common in MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P). It is assumed that the cognitive impairment in MSA-P is caused by the striatal dysfunction and disruption of striatofrontal connections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between regional glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex and striatum in patients with MSA-P using [ 18 F]FDG brain PET.    Methods  Twenty-nine patients with MSA-P and 28 healthy controls underwent [ 18 F]FDG brain PET scan. The [ 18 F]FDG brain PET images were semiquantitatively analyzed on the basis of a template in standard space. The regional glucose metabolism of the cerebral cortex and striatum were compared between MSA-P and healthy control groups. The correlations between age, symptom duration, H&Y stage, UPDRS III score, MMSE score, and glucose metabolism in the cerebellum and striatum to glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex were evaluated by multivariate analysis.    Results  The glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex and striatum in MSA-P patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls. Glucose metabolism in the striatum was the most powerful determinant of glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex in MSA-P. Only age and glucose metabolism in the cerebellum were independent variables affecting the glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex in healthy controls.    Conclusion  The decrease in frontal glucose metabolism in MSA-P is related to the decrease in striatal glucose metabolism. This result provided evidence of striatofrontal deafferentiation in patients with MSA-P.

Following current diagnostic criteria, MSA is classified into two subtypes according to the predominant symptoms: MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) and MSA with cerebellar features (MSA-C) [ 1 ]. Although cognitive impairment in MSA is still defined as a non-supporting diagnostic feature by current consensus diagnostic criteria, increasing evidence suggests that cognitive impairment is common in both MSA subtypes [ 2 – 4 ]. Recent prospective neuropsychological studies estimated dementia prevalence rates in MSA of up to 31% [ 5 , 6 ], and almost 50% of patients surviving more than 8 years are reported to be cognitively impaired [ 7 ]. Cognitive impairments in MSA occur across a wide spectrum from mild single domain deficits to impairments in multiple domains [ 7 ]. Frontal-executive dysfunction is the most common presentation, while memory and visuospatial functions also are impaired [ 7 , 8 ]. Comparative studies of cognitive impairment in MSA-P and MSA-C showed that patients with MSA-P had more severe and more widespread cognitive dysfunctions than patients with MSA-C [ 9 ]. In accordance with the clinical features, [ 18 F]FDG PET has shown a decrease in glucose metabolism not only in the putamen, pons, and cerebellum but also in the frontal and parieto-temporal cortices in patients with MSA [ 10 , 11 ].  It is assumed that cognitive impairment in MSA is caused by striatal dysfunction and disruption of striatofrontal connections [ 4 , 9 ]. Neuropathological findings support the concept that cognitive impairments in MSA originate from striatofrontal deafferentiation [ 2 , 12 , 13 ]. In Parkinson’s disease, many studies on cognitive impairment have revealed structural and functional abnormalities within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, known to be largely modulated by the dopaminergic system [ 14 – 16 ]. However, no study has yet demonstrated that the decreased cerebral cortical activity, which results in cognitive impairment, is correlated with striatal degeneration in patients with MSA. Although a histopathologic examination in the clinical field is limited, [ 18 F]FDG PET can demonstrate the neuronal synaptic activity that correlates to striatonigral and cerebral cortical degeneration [ 11 , 17 , 18 ]. Alterations of functional connectivity in several brain diseases have been investigated by interregional correlation analysis using [ 18 F]FDG PET [ 19 , 20 ]. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between regional glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex and striatum in patients with MSA-P using [ 18 F]FDG brain PET.    Materials and Methods   Subjects  Twenty-nine patients that underwent [ 18 F]FDG brain PET scan and had clinically probable MSA-P were enrolled in this study. The clinical diagnoses were made by movement disorder specialists according to established criteria [ 1 ]. All patients were assessed by a neurologist specializing in movement disorders, and their medical records were made available. Motor disability related to parkinsonism was assessed in all patients in an off-drug state using Part III of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III) and was classified according to the Hoehn & Yahr stage score (H&Y stage) immediately before the [ 18 F]FDG PET. The cognitive test was performed within 1 month of the [ 18 F]FDG PET study. General intellectual function was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Symptom duration was defined as the time interval from initial symptom onset to the time that patients underwent [ 18 F]FDG PET. Twenty-eight healthy controls (18 men and 10 women; mean age 52.5 ± 7.0 years) were selected from the normal PET data pool maintained at the Asan Medical Center. Healthy controls were selected to have no neurological or psychological diseases. The institutional review board of the Asan Medical Center approved this study and all subjects signed a written informed consent form.    PET Scan  The [ 18 F]FDG PET was performed for all 29 patients with MSA-P and 28 healthy controls. All subjects fasted for at least 6 h before the scan, and the PET scans were performed in a quiet and dimly lit room. A transmission scan of 5 min using a 68 Ge rotating pin source and an emission scan of 15 min were acquired 40 min after intravenous injection of 370 MBq [ 18 F]FDG on the ECAT HR+ PET scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Hoffman Estate, IL). The scanner imaged 63 planes with a slice thickness of 2.46 mm simultaneously for a longitudinal field of view of 15.5 cm. The transaxial field of view (FOV) was 22 cm and the matrix size was 128 × 128 (resulting voxel size: 1.72 × 1.72 × 2.46 mm 3 ). The spatial resolution in the air (NEMA NU2-2001 test results) was 5 mm full width half maximum (FWHM). All emission images were reconstructed with ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) using 16 subsets and six iterations.    Semiquantitative Analyses  Image processing was performed with SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London) within MATLAB 2013a (The MathWorks, Inc.) and MRIcro version 1.37 (Chris Rorden, Columbia, SC, USA, www.mricro.com ). Semiquantitative analyses were based on volumes-of-interest (VOIs), as described previously [ 21 ]. All reconstructed PET images were spatially normalized to Montreal Neurology Institute (MNI) space (approximating Talairach space) using standard MNI PET templates. To analyze the striatum and the cerebellum, six VOIs for the bilateral ventral striatum, caudate nucleus, and putamen, and two VOIs for both cerebellar cortices were manually drawn on a canonical spatially-normalized T1 MRI image by an experienced nuclear medicine physician specializing in nuclear neurology. The VOI for the ventral striatum was defined on the basis of previously defined criteria [ 22 ], and the ventral striatum included the nucleus accumbens, the ventral caudate rostral to the anterior caudate, and the ventral putamen rostral to the anterior caudate. The outer boundaries of the striatal subregions were visually determined from the characteristic increased activity of the striatum, which readily distinguished these regions from extrastriatal structures. For analysis of the bilateral cerebral cortices, 20 regional VOIs were identified via the automated anatomic labeling (AAL) template, as previously described [ 23 ]. The regional VOIs for the cerebral cortices were the central region, lateral, medial, and orbital surfaces of the frontal lobe, lateral surface of temporal lobe, lateral and medial surfaces of parietal lobe, occipital lobe, limbic lobe, and insula. The VOI template in standard stereotactic space was automatically applied directly to the spatially normalized individual PET images to analyze glucose metabolism in the brain.  The activity concentration was calculated in each VOI of the [ 18 F]FDG PET images. The occipital VOI was used as the non-specific reference tissue. The regional glucose metabolic ratio (MR) was defined as follows: MR = count of regional VOI/count of occipital VOI. The count was defined as counts per voxel in each VOI, more exactly, in [Bq/ml] units.    Statistical Analyses  The age, MMSE score and MR of the bilateral striatum, cerebellum, and cerebral cortices were compared between the healthy control and MSA-P groups using student’s t tests. The sex difference between each group was evaluated with the chi-square test. The relationships between MR of the ipsilateral frontal lobe, and age, symptom duration, H&Y stage, UPDRS III score, MMSE score, MR of the contralateral cerebellum, and MR of the ipsilateral striatum were analyzed by Pearson correlations and simple linear regression analyses. The relationships between MR of the ipsilateral frontal lobe and MR of the ipsilateral striatum were assessed by multiple linear regression analyses to adjust for other possible covariables, including age and MR of the contralateral cerebellum. The p- values were corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate correction. A p- value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance, and the data for the study variables were expressed as mean ± SD.

Relationship between Striatal and Frontal Metabolism  To identify the correlations between MR of the ipsilateral frontal lobe and age, symptom duration, H&Y stage, UPDRS III score, MR of contralateral cerebellum, or MR of ipsilateral striatum, Pearson correlation analyses were performed in healthy control and MSA-P groups. In healthy controls, MR of the right cerebellum correlated positively to MR of the lateral and orbital surfaces of the left frontal lobe ( Fig 1 ). There were moderate negative correlations between age and MR of the lateral, medial, and orbital surfaces of the left frontal lobe. There was no significant correlation between MRs of the left striatum and left frontal lobe except between MRs of the left ventral striatum and orbital surface of the left frontal lobe ( S1 Table ). In MSA-P patients, age and MRs of the left ventral striatum and left caudate nucleus correlated to MR of the lateral and orbital surfaces of the left frontal lobe ( Fig 2 ). The symptom duration, H&Y stage, UPDRS III score, MMSE score, and MRs of the left putamen and right cerebellum did not correlate to MRs of the left frontal lobe. The relationships between MR of the right frontal lobe and age, symptom duration, H&Y stage, UPDRS III score, MMSE score, and MRs of the left cerebellum and right striatum were similar to those of the left frontal lobe ( S2 Table ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169928.g001  Fig 1   Relationships between left frontal glucose metabolism, and age, cerebellar and striatal glucose metabolism in healthy control.      10.1371/journal.pone.0169928.g002  Fig 2   Relationships between left frontal glucose metabolism, and age, cerebellar and striatal glucose metabolism in MSA-P.     Multiple linear regression analyses showed that age and MR of the right cerebellum were significant independent variables to MR of the lateral and orbital surfaces of the left frontal lobe, and only age was an independent variable to MR of medial surfaces of the left frontal lobe in healthy control ( Table 3 ). In MSA-P patients, MR of the left ventral striatum was the most powerful determinant of MR of the lateral and orbital surfaces of the left frontal lobe ( Table 4 ). In addition, age was an independent variable to MR of the lateral surface of the left frontal lobe, and MR of the right cerebellum was an independent variable to MR of orbital surface of the left frontal lobe. To MR of medial surface of the left frontal lobe, only age was an independent variable. To MRs of right frontal lobe, multiple linear regression analysis showed the similar results with left frontal lobe in healthy control and MSA-P groups.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169928.t003  Table 3  Result of linear regression analysis for determinants of frontal glucose metabolism in healthy control.

Discussion  This study demonstrated a positive correlation between frontal cortical activity and striatal activity in MSA-P. Decreased glucose metabolism in the bilateral frontal cortex and striatum was noted in MSA-P patients compared with healthy controls, and the glucose metabolism of the frontal cortex was positively correlated with the glucose metabolism of the striatum in MSA-P. Multivariate analysis showed that glucose metabolism of the ventral striatum was the most powerful determinant of glucose metabolism of the frontal cortex in MSA-P, while the determinant in healthy controls was not glucose metabolism of the striatum, but age and glucose metabolism of the cerebellum. This is the first study to demonstrate the striatofrontal deafferentiation in patients with MSA-P using [ 18 F]FDG PET scan.  Recent reports suggest that cognitive impairment in MSA is more frequent than previously recognized [ 5 – 7 ]. Mild to moderate deficits in executive functions and impairments in attention and phonemic fluency were frequently observed in patients with MSA [ 5 , 7 ]. Comparative study on subtypes of MSA revealed that patients with MSA-P tended toward a wide and severe impairment in cognitive function compared with patients with MSA-C [ 9 ]. Many imaging studies also showed cortical degeneration in MSA. MRI studies indicated a characteristic pattern of prefrontal, frontal, temporal, and parietal cortical atrophy in MSA-P [ 13 , 24 ]. The cortical atrophy is supported by decreased glucose metabolism on [ 18 F]FDG PET in prefrontal, frontal, temporal, and parietal regions in neuropathologically confirmed MSA-P [ 25 ]. Significant correlations between decreased glucose metabolism or decreased perfusion in the frontal cortex and executive function have been reported in MSA [ 9 , 11 ]. We found decreased glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex, which is in agreement with results of previous studies.  Many imaging and neuropathological studies indicated that cognitive impairments in MSA originate from striatofrontal deafferentiation, with additional contributions from intrinsic cortical degeneration and cerebellar pathology. Paviour et al. [ 26 ] reported a correlation between striatal atrophy and impairment in different cognitive domains as well as global cognition in patients with MSA. An MRI study with voxel-based morphometry revealed that volume change in the caudate nucleus correlated significantly with cognitive test scores [ 27 ]. Despite the lack of detailed neuropsychological studies in patients with pathologically proven MSA, the similarity of widespread subcortical pathology in other degenerative basal ganglia disorders indirectly suggests that the disruption of subcortico-cortical pathways is likely to mediate some of the cognitive impairment in MSA [ 14 , 16 , 28 ]. On the other hand, post-mortem evidence of cortical degeneration supports additional primary cortical involvement in the cognitive deficits found in MSA [ 29 – 31 ]. Neuronal loss, astrogliosis, and loss of myelinated fibers in deeper cortical layers of the frontal lobes, abundant glial cytoplasmic inclusions found in deep cortical gray matter and the white matter of frontal and parietal lobes [ 29 , 30 ], and the vacuolation of glial cells in the frontal cortex [ 31 ] point toward prominent frontal degeneration in MSA. Pathologic studies have revealed that the putamen are is more severely involved than the caudate nucleus and the ventral striatum in MSA [ 32 , 33 ]. However, we found that glucose metabolism in the ventral striatum was the most powerful determinant of glucose metabolism in the frontal lobe and that glucose metabolism in the putamen had a weak correlation with glucose metabolism in the frontal lobe. This finding is in agreement with probabilistic diffusion tractography studies with connectivity analysis showing that the ventral striatum is functionally connected to the frontal cortex, and that the putamen is connected to the supplementary motor and primary motor areas. Although our results cannot be used to exclude the possibility that the frontal cortex is directly affected by α-synuclein pathology in MSA, they support the idea that secondary disruption of striatocortical connectivity may, at least partially, contribute to decreased neuronal activity in the frontal lobe in MSA.  Cerebral glucose metabolism correlates negatively with age [ 34 ] and correlates positively with contralateral cerebellar glucose metabolism [ 35 ]. In accordance with previous studies, the present study showed that not only striatal glucose metabolism but also age and cerebellar glucose metabolism are independent variables to frontal glucose metabolism in MSA-P. In healthy controls, only age and cerebellar glucose metabolism are independent variables to frontal glucose metabolism. Although there was also striatofrontal connectivity in healthy controls, a weak correlation between the striatal and frontal glucose metabolism would result from the many variable factors other than striatal activity that influence frontal cortical activity in healthy brain [ 18 – 20 ]. Decreased glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex with age does not appear to be mediated by amyloid pathology, as decreased glucose metabolism appears to begin before the age of 60 years, before there is appreciable accumulation of β-amyloid in the cerebral cortex [ 36 ]. Cortical metabolic changes observed in normal aging support the developmental theory, in which age-related brain changes follow phylogenetic and ontogenetic axes [ 37 ]. The topographic pattern of decreased glucose metabolism in normal aging matches in a reverse sense the metabolic functional changes observed in developing human brain. A correlation between ipsilateral frontal and contralateral cerebellar glucose metabolism is attributable to modulation by the frontal cortical activity in the contralateral cerebellum, because the corticopontine-pontocerebellar system is the largest system linking the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and contralateral cerebellum [ 38 ].  The reference tissue assignment is important for semiquantitative assessment of glucose metabolism, because the variability of activity concentration in the reference tissue could greatly affect the study results. In most studies using [ 18 F]FDG brain PET, the whole brain has been used as the reference, and the image data were proportionally scaled to the cerebral global mean count [ 10 , 14 , 39 ]. However, global count normalization could underestimate the regional cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with MSA, because several studies with MSA have shown decreased glucose metabolism in most parts of the brain, including the striatum, cerebellum, brainstem, and cerebral cortex [ 26 , 39 , 40 ]. Therefore, cerebral regions that have preserved glucose metabolism should be assigned as the reference for more accurate semiquantitative analysis in patients with MSA. Lyoo et al. [ 11 ] and Teune et al. [ 39 ] reported that SPM analysis of FDG PET showed decreased glucose metabolism in the putamen and cerebellar hemisphere, as well as decreased glucose metabolism in the parietotemporal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and motor cortex in patients with MSA, but no significant change in the occipital cortex. Pathologic reports also revealed numerous glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the frontal cortex and white matter and neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal cortices, but very few glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the occipital cortex [ 30 , 41 ]. The present study thus used the occipital cortex as the non-specific reference tissue, and MR could be calculated consistently.  Although cognitive impairment is relatively frequent in MSA-P, it involves primarily frontal-executive functions. General cognitive decline as assessed by MMSE is uncommon, but frontal lobe-related functions as measured by the frontal assessment battery and Raven's colored progressive matrices were frequently impaired in MSA-P [ 8 , 9 ]. In the present study, cognitive function as assessed by MMSE was not correlated with frontal glucose metabolism. This may be due to the limitations of this retrospective study, as the MMSE is not an ideal cognitive assessment method for patients with MSA and we did not perform frontal executive function tests. Although we found secondary disruption of striatofrontal connectivity in MSA-P, we were unable to determine the effects of striatofrontal deafferentation on cognition. A prospective study with frontal executive function tests could reveal significant correlations between frontal glucose metabolism and executive function, and between striatal metabolism and executive function in patients with MSA-P.    Conclusions  The present study demonstrated that the decreased frontal glucose metabolism in MSA-P is related to the decreased striatal glucose metabolism. This result provides evidence of striatofrontal deafferentiation in patients with MSA-P. Further studies with frontal executive function tests will be required to ascertain that cognitive impairments in MSA-P originate from striatofrontal deafferentiation as a result of subcortical pathology.

Aminoalcohols have been addressed as activating buffers for alkaline phosphatase. However, there is no record on the buffer activation regarding organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH). Here we reported the activating effects of aminoalcohols on OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an analog molecule of G-type warfare agents. The kinetic parametors k cat , V max and k cat / K m in the OPH reaction were remarkably increased in the buffers (pH 8.0, 25°C) containing aminoalcohols with C2 between nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) in their structures, including triethanolamine (TEA), diethanolamine, monoethanolamine, 1-amino-2-propanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, and triisopropanolamine. In contrast, much lower or no rate-enhancing effects were observed in the adding of amines, alcohols, amine/alcohol mixtures, or 3-amino-1-propanol (C3 between N and O). The 300 mM TEA further increased DFP-degrading activities of OPH mutants F132Y and L140Y, the previously reported OPH mutants with desirable activities towards DFP. However, the treatment of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) markedly abolished the TEA-induced activation of OPH. The product fluoride effectively inhibited OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP by a linear mixed inhibition (inhibition constant K i ~ 3.21 mM), which was partially released by TEA adding at initial or later reaction stage. The obtained results indicate the activation of OPH by aminoalcohol buffers could be attributed to the reduction of fluoride inhibition, which would be beneficial to the hydrolase-based detoxification of organophosphofluoridate.       http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  National Natural Science Foundation of China    Grant no. 31101595   Yongze Yuan        http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  National Natural Science Foundation of China    Grant no.31371893   Deli Liu       Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities   Grant no.

ATCC 27551, has been characterized as a typical phosphotriesterase (PTE) with a rather broad substrate specificity [ 1 – 4 ]. This enzyme, in the form of native or recombinant protein, has been documented to catalyze the hydrolysis of a wide variety of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitors, the chemical compounds highly toxic to mammalian organisms [ 5 , 6 ]. The substrates of OPH include organophosphate insecticides paraoxon, parathion, methylparathion, coumaphos, and diazinon, as well as potent nerve agents sarin, soman, and their analog diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) ( Fig 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.g001  Fig 1   Molecular structures of DFP, GB, GD, diethyl fluorophosphate, and paraoxon (ethyl-paraoxon).     OPH is one of the best characterized OP hydrolases and the catalysis mechanism has been intensively proposed based on the protein structures. The crystal structure of OPH revealed the decisive contribution of binuclear metal center in the active site to the hydrolytic activity towards different OPs [ 4 , 7 – 12 ]. The binuclear metal center, comprised of either two equivalents of Zn 2+ in the native enzyme or mixed metal ions Cd 2+ , Co 2+ , Mn 2+ , and Ni 2+ in the metal-substituted catalysts, has been illustrated to generate the activated water molecules that initiate nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom of the substrate, resulting in the cleavage of phosphoester bond and the release of leaving group [ 2 – 4 , 8 – 10 ]. In addition, the rate of OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis depends on the substrate. The OPH exhibited much lower rates to DFP hydrolysis, as compared to its best substrate paraoxon [ 2 , 13 , 14 ]. Up to now, all the efforts to enhance the enzyme activity against DFP have focused on the generation of OPH mutants through directed evolution and the further protein engineering [ 2 , 3 , 8 , 15 – 17 ]. The contribution of buffer environment to enhancing catalytic abilities of OPH (DFP hydrolase) has been rarely studied.  The buffer and solvent species have been proposed to remarkably influence enzyme activities. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a typical group of phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.1), exhibited much better performance on phosphomonoesters hydrolysis in the tris and imidazole buffers [ 18 , 19 ]. The various aminoalcohol derivatives, including 2-(ethylamino)ethanol, N -methylethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine, have been verified as activators to enhance bovine intestine ALP (BIALP) activity to degrade p -nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) [ 20 ]. ALPs have been classified to the metalloenzyme, and the reported activators are nitrogen-containing organic compounds that probably act as phophoacceptor and/or suitable ligands for the critical metal ions. Recently, two sets of synthetic nitrogen-containing organic materials, Zn 2+ -azamacrocyclic complexes and oxime substituted β-cyclodextrin derivatives, were illustrated as the novel non-enzyme catalysts accelerating the hydrolysis of paraoxon and cyclosarin (GF) [ 21 , 22 ]. These reports suggested the activating effects of hydroxyl amine nitrogen derivatives on the particular OP hydrolysis. In the present study, we proposed the activation of DFP hydrolysis by aminoalcohols and kinetically addressed this hypothesis.  Previous reports have described many chemical compounds capable of inhibiting OP hydrolase activities. Dementon-S has been identified as a noncompetitive inhibitor against paraoxon hydrolysis [ 16 , 23 ]. Paraoxon at the concentration beyond 400 μM was reported to induce a specific substrate inhibition in the OpdA-catalyzed hydrolysis of this OP compound [ 14 ]. The fluoride, typically in the form of anion F − , is an effective inhibitor of metalloenzymes, including peroxidases [ 24 ], laccase [ 25 ], ureases [ 26 ], arginase [ 27 ], purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) [ 28 , 29 ], and OP hydrolases [ 14 ]. The inhibition of fluoride on paraoxon hydrolysis has been kinetically assessed for OpdA and OPH, both enzymes requiring dinuclear metal centre to activate hydroxide in the initiation of catalysis [ 14 ]. Fluoride is one of products released during OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP ( Fig 2 ), thus the effect of aminoalcohol on fluoride inhibition is also an interesting issue to address.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.g002  Fig 2   OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP.     In the present study, we compared the effects of various aminoalcohols, amines, and alcohols ( Fig 3 ) on OPH activity against DFP by kinetics studies. To discuss the mechanism on OPH activation by aminoalcohols, the kinetics of fluoride inhibition on the OPH-catalyzed DFP hydrolysis was also analyzed in the absence and in the presence of triethanolamine.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.g003  Fig 3   Molecular structures of aminoalcohols, aminoalcohol analogs, amines and alcohols examined in this study.       Materials and Methods   Bacterial strains, plasmids, and materials  Flavobacterium sp. ATCC 27551, recently identified as Sphingobium fuliginis [ 30 ], was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) for the opd gene cloning. The E . coli strains DH5α (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) and BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for recombinant plasmid amplification and protein expression, respectively. The cloning vector pUC118 was purchased from TaKaRa (Otsu, Japan), and the vector pET-28 (Novagen), which introduces a His6-tag (His-tag ™ ; Novagen) at the N-terminus, was used for gene expression. Isopropyl thio-β-dgalactoside (IPTG), ampicillin, kanamycin, imidazole, and Tris Base were purchased from Ameresco (Tully, NY, USA). The restriction enzymes Eco RI and Hin dIII and the other reagents used in gene cloning were products of TaKaRa (Otsu, Japan). All chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corp. (Shanghai, China). Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), the substrate for OPH catalysis, was synthesized in our laboratory and identified by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy ( S1 Fig ).    Cloning and site-directed mutagenesis of OPH  Sphingobium sp. ATCC 27551 was cultured in SP medium, as described by Ohmori et al. [ 31 ], and the genomic DNA was extracted using a bacterial DNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length opd gene was amplified from the genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to construct plasmid pUC-opd as described by Ohmori et al [ 31 ]. Using the plasmid pUC-opd as templates, the gene encoding OPH without N-terminus 29 amino acids was PCR-amplified with the designated primers ( S1 Table ), and overlap-extension PCR was performed to generate the mutants F132Y, L140Y, and F132Y/L140Y with primers listed in S1 Table . The PCR products were purified, digested with Eco RI and Hin dIII, and then ligated with vector pET-28. The constructed plasmids were transformed into E . coli DH5α for positive clone screening and DNA sequencing.    Expression and purification of recombinant OPH  The pET-opd(m) plasmids encoding His6-tagged OPH (wild type and mutants) were transformed into E . coli BL21(DE3) cells to express recombinant enzymes with IPTG induction. After 18 h induction at 18°C, the cells were collected by centrifugation, disrupted by sonication, and the target enzyme, validated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), was purified by a Ni-NTA His-bind ™ Resin column (Novagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford [ 32 ], and the purified proteins were stored at -20°C until further use.    Kinetic analysis of OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP  The rate of OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP was measured by monitoring the release of fluoride (F − ) with an F − -specific electrode (Thermo Orion, USA) as described previously [ 2 , 3 ]. The reaction mixture (10 ml) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 μM ZnCl 2 , 1–50 mM DFP, and 10 nM enzyme sample was used to determine DFP hydrolysis rate at 25°C in the absence and presence of aminoalcohols, amines and alcohols. 1.0 M HCl was used to adjust pH 8.0 for all the assays. The initial velocity ( V ) (μM/min), defined as F − production rate in the first 5 min with a deduction of non-enzymatic hydrolysis rate of DFP, was plotted against DFP concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM) and made fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation (hyperbola profile) using the Enzyme Kinetics Module from GraphPad Prism (version 5.0). The kinetic parameters, maximum velocity ( V max ) and Michaelis constant ( K m ), were calculated by the plots of 1/ V against 1/[DFP] with changing DFP concentrations according to Lineweaver-Burk equation, i.e. 1/ V = 1/ V max + ( K m / V max ) · (1/[DFP]). The k cat values were calculated as V max /[E] ([E] = 10 nM) and also made fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0). The specificity constant ( k cat / K m ) was obtained from the determined k cat and K m . To investigate if the alcohol and amine groups must be present in the same molecule regarding the additive-induced rate-enhancing effects, an one plus one mixture of an alcohol and a simple amine (ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, or methylamine) at 300 mM (final concentration) was added to OPH reaction solution mentioned above, and the kinetic parameters k cat , V max and K m were determined. The changes of kinetic parameters ( k cat , V max and K m ) for OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP after adding analog molecules for MEA, DEA and TEA were also investigated. The MEA analogs investigated were 3-amino-1-propanol, 1-amino-2-propanol and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, the DEA analogs were thiodiglycol and thiodipropanol, and the TEA analog was triisopropanolamine. The concentration of each additive used in this study was 300 mM, and the other conditions were the same as described above. To investigate the role of metal center (Zn 2+ ) in the aminoalcohol effects, k cat values were determined for the wild-type and mutant OPH (F132Y, L140Y and F132Y/ L140Y) incubated with 50 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) for 2 h at 25°C, and the kinetic analysis was conducted with the described reaction buffer (pH8.0) in the absence and presence of 300 mM triethanolamine.    Kinetic analysis of fluoride inhibition  The kinetic analysis of sodium fluoride (NaF) inhibition was conducted in the absence and presence of triethanolamine (100, 200, and 300 mM). At each triethanolamine concentration, the substrate DFP was incubated in 10 ml of assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 μM ZnCl 2 ) with 10 nM OPH and different concentrations of inhibitor NaF (0, 1, 2, and 3 mM). The enzyme was pre-incubated at 4°C with NaF for 2 h before the initiation of assays at 25°C. The apparent V max and K m in the inhibitory effects with or without triethanolamine were calculated from 1/ V vs 1/[S] plots with changing DFP concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM), as described in Lineweaver-Burk equation. In the analysis of fluoride inhibition, the k cat was calculated by the apparent V max and total enzyme concentration (10 nM), and the specific constant ( k cat / K m ) was calculated by k cat and K m . The inhibition constant ( K i ) for NaF in the OPH catalysis was calculated by the replot of apparent K m obtained from the double-reciprocal plots against inhibitor NaF concentrations. To investigate buffering capacity of aminoalcohol for fluoride inhibitor in OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP, 500 μL of NaF stocking (300 mM) was added to 50 mL of TEA-free or -containing reaction solution (50 mM Tris-HCl/pH 8.0, 100 μM ZnCl 2 , initial OPH concentration = 10 nM, and initial DFP concentration = 20 mM) at the end of the first reaction stage (0–5 minutes), i.e. at the beginning of the second reaction stage (5–10 minutes; defined as "later reaction stage"), and the dependence of DFP hydrolysis velocity on reaction time (0–10 minutes) was recorded once per minute at 25°C. Similarly, at the beginning of the mentioned later reaction stage (5–10 minutes), a defined volume of TEA-HCl stocking (3 M; pH 8.0) was added to 50 mL of enzymatic solution (50 mM Tris-HCl/pH 8.0, 100 μM ZnCl 2 , initial OPH concentration = 10 nM, and initial DFP concentration = 20 mM) to the final TEA concentration 100, 200, and 300 mM, and these reaction systems were used to further evaluate the aminoalcohol-induced OPH activation under an obvious fluoride inhibition condition.     Results   Effects of aminoalcohols on the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP  To investigate the effects of aminoalcohols on the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP, we first made kinetic analysis of OPH in the hydrolysis of DFP with various aminoalcohols. As shown in Fig 4 , the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP displayed Michaelis-Menten-type saturation behavior in the presence of the investigated aminoalcohols. Compared to the control, the initial velocity ( V ) for the enzymatic hydrolysis of DFP was markedly increased with 300 mM triethanolamine (TEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and monoethanolamine (MEA), at pH 8.0 and 25°C ( Fig 4A ). The order of aminoalcohols for the activation efficiency was TEA > DEA > MEA. In the presence of the three aminoalcohols, the similar results were obtained for the change of k cat ( V /[E]) in the OPH reactions ( Fig 4B ). In contrast, little activating effects of the aminoalcohols were observed in non-enzymatic hydrolysis of DFP (data not shown). The results indicate that all the examined aminoalcohols activate the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.g004  Fig 4   Kinetic analysis of OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP in the presence of 300 mM aminoalcohols.

Data are expressed as the mean±SD of three independent experiments.     Further, TEA, the best activator in the present study, was chosen to assess the effect of aminoalcohol concentration on the OPH activation. The increase in the apparent V ( Fig 5A ) and k cat ( V /[E]) ( Fig 5B ) was clearly observed with varying TEA concentrations (100–400 mM). The activation folds were gradually increased with the given TEA concentrations. The activation of OPH by TEA was also kinetically fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation ( Fig 5 ). All the plots in Fig 5 showed saturated profiles, thus the associated kinetic parameters of OPH, including k cat , V max , K m and k cat / K m , were determined separately ( Table 1 ). In the given concentration range (100–400 mM), the k cat values were elevated with increasing aminoalcohol concentrations: the value at 400 mM TEA was 477 ± 6 s −1 , which was 206% of that at 100 mM (231 ± 7 s −1 ); the value at 400 mM DEA was 312 ± 13 s −1 , which was 204% of that at 100 mM (153 ± 8 s −1 ); and the value at 400 mM MEA was 209 ± 10 s −1 , which was 146% of that at 100 mM (143 ± 10 s −1 ). The similar results were obtained in the changes of V max and k cat / K m with the increasing aminoalcohol concentrations ( Table 1 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.g005  Fig 5   Kinetic analysis of OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP with increasing triethanolamine (TEA) concentrations.

The initial enzyme concentration was 10 nM and the DFP concentrations were defined as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM. Data are expressed as the mean±SD of three independent experiments.      Effects of alcohols and amines on the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP  To evaluate the contribution of hydroxyl and amino groups in the aminoalcohols to the activation of OPH, we made kinetic analysis of OPH in the hydrolysis of DFP with various alcohols (hydroxyl donor) and amines (amino donor). The 300 mM alcohols, including ethanol, glycerol, and methanol, had little effects on the kinetic parameters of OPH in the DFP hydrolysis ( Table 2 ), indicating that these alcohols could not activate OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP. Table 3 described the kinetic parameters of OPH in the DFP hydrolysis with varying concentrations (100–300 mM) of ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, and methylamine. Compared to the control (117 ± 4 s -1 ), the k cat values for the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP were slightly increased by the four amines at 300 mM, reaching 180 ± 8, 163 ± 12, 148 ± 9, and 193 ± 10 s -1 , respectively ( Table 3 ). The orders of these amines for the efficiency in the OPH activation were methylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, and triethylamine. The similar results were obtained in the change of V max . However, the activation of OPH by these amines was not remarkable compared to that by the corresponding aminoalcohols. On the other hand, the K m values also slightly increased with increasing concentrations of amines. The increasing rate of K m was very similar to that of k cat . Thus, the ratio of k cat to K m ( k cat / K m ) exhibited no obvious increase at any amine concentrations, indicating the poor ability of the amines to activate OPH. Additionally, a mixture of ethanol and a simple amine (ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, or methylamine) at 300 mM had no more higher ability to activate OPH, as compared to the amine alone ( Table 4 ). The similar results were also obtained in such one plus one mixtures of the amines and alcohols (methanol and glycerol) (data not shown). Hence, the activating effects of additives observed in this study might require the coexistence of alcohol and amine groups in the same molecule.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.t002  Table 2  Kinetic parameters of OPH in the DFP hydrolysis in the presence of 300 mM alcohols.

Changes of kinetic parameters for OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP after adding analog molecules for MEA, DEA and TEA  The changes of kinetic parameters for OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP after adding analog molecules for MEA, DEA and TEA were further investigated, including thiodiglycol, thiodipropanol, and aminoalcohols with more than two carbon atoms between nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O). As shown in Table 5 , even at 300 mM, 3-Amino-1-propanol, a C3 aminoalcohol with three carbon atoms between N and O, exhibited little ability to enhance OPH catalysis rate. In contrast, at the same concentration, the other aminoalcohols with more than two carbon atoms in structure but only two carbon atoms between N and O, including 1-amino-2-propanol (C3), 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (C4), and triisopropanolamine (C9), all exhibited rate-enhancing effects on the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP ( Table 5 ). Triisopropanolamine (tertiary amine), an analog molecule of TEA, had approximately 85% activating effect of TEA, and the two MEA analog molecules, 1-amino-2-propanol and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (primary amines), had similar activating effects of MEA. Comparatively, the only one extra carbon atom between N and O sharply reduced the activating effects of aminoalcohols, suggesting the critical role of atom distance between amino-N and hydroxyl-O in such aminoalcohol-induced activation. Based on this, a similar system without N but with S (thiodiglycol and thiodipropanol) was also exploited in the present study. As shown in Table 5 , at 300 mM, thiodiglycol with two carbon atoms between sulfur (S) and O, rather than thiodipropanol with just one more carbon atom, remarkably activated OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP, reaching at a comparable level of DEA.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.t005  Table 5  Changes of kinetic parameters for OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP after adding analog molecules of MEA, DEA and TEA.

The DEA analogs with N atom replaced by S are thiodiglycol and thiodipropanol. The TEA analog with more than two carbon atoms in structure is triisopropanolamine. The concentration of each additive used in this study was 300 mM, and the other reaction conditions and statistics analysis were the same as described in Table 1 .      Effects of TEA on the catalytic activities of OPH mutants towards DFP in the absence and presence of EDTA  As reported by Watkins et al. [ 2 ] and Gopal et al. [ 3 ], OPH mutants F132Y and L140Y exhibited most desirable DFP-degrading activities, approximately 3–5 folds higher than the wild-type enzyme. However, these results were obtained in HEPES and ammonium carbonate buffers without any aminoalcohols. In the present study, to confirm the activating effects of aminoalcohol, we kinetically evaluated the OPH mutants towards DFP hydrolysis in the presence of 300 mM TEA. As shown in Table 6 , 300 mM TEA markedly activated the OPH mutants concerning DFP hydrolysis. The apparent k cat and k cat / K m of double mutant F132Y/L140Y were increased to 2170 ± 40 s -1 and 541.7 ± 12.6 mM -1 s -1 at 300 mM TEA, respectively 2.7- and 1.9-folds higher than those at 0 mM TEA ( Table 6 ). The similar results were also obtained for the single-point mutants F132Y and L140Y. However, the treatments of 50 mM EDTA predominantly decreased k cat values of OPH mutants concerning DFP hydrolysis ( Fig 6A ) and to a large extent abolished the activating effects of TEA on the DFP-degrading activities of OPH mutants ( Fig 6B ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.t006  Table 6  Kinetic parameters of OPH mutants in the DFP hydrolysis with or without triethanolamine (TEA).

Except for the TEA and EDTA concentrations particularly mentioned, the reaction conditions and statistics analysis were the same as described in Fig 4 .       Fluoride inhibition of wild-type OPH in the absence and presence of TEA  Inhibition studies on the hydrolysis of DFP were performed using sodium fluoride (NaF) as the inhibitor against the wild-type OPH with Zn 2+ as the active-site metal. The product (fluoride) inhibition of OPH in the absence of TEA was kinetically fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation ( Fig 7 ). All the plots in Fig 7 showed saturated profiles, thus the associated apparent kinetic parameters of OPH, including apparent K m , V max and k cat / K m , were determined separately ( Table 7 ). As shown in Table 7 , the apparent V max and k cat / K m of OPH for DFP hydrolysis gradually decreased with increasing NaF concentrations. This inhibitory effect of NaF was observed in the investigated buffers with 0, 100, 200, and 300 mM TEA ( Table 7 ), suggesting a specific product inhibition of OPH by fluoride. The apparent K m values were obviously elevated with increasing NaF concentrations at any TEA conditions, indicating a relatively poor affinity of DFP for OPH in the presence of fluoride inhibitor. At 3 mM NaF, the kinetics of OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP under TEA conditions were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation ( Fig 8 ), and the saturated profiles of all the plots allowed for the separate determination of apparent kinetic parameters for OPH ( Table 7 ). In the absence of TEA, the apparent V max and k cat / K m were decreased to 17.2 ± 0.2 μM min -1 and 6.45 ± 0.94 mM -1 s -1 , respectively, at 3 mM NaF. In contrast, the adding of TEA increased the V max and k cat / K m values at the NaF treatment. As shown in Table 7 , in the presence of 300 mM TEA, the apparent V max and k cat / K m at 3 mM NaF were 106.1 ± 1.1 μM min -1 and 36.23 ± 5.07 mM -1 s -1 , respectively, approximately 4.5-folds higher than that in the absence of TEA. At any concentration of inhibitor fluoride, the markedly increase in the kinetic parameters ( V max and k cat / K m ) for the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP were also observed in the TEA treatments ( Table 7 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.g007  Fig 7   Kinetic analysis of fluoride inhibition of OPH-catalyzed DFP hydrolysis in the absence of triethanolamine.

The reaction conditions and statistics analysis were the same as described in Table 1 .    Fig 9 illustrated the Lineweaver-Burk plots of Zn 2+ -liganded OPH in the presence of 0, 100, 200, and 300 mM TEA. At each TEA concentration, three different inhibitor (NaF) concentrations were used, ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mM. The double-reciprocal plot for the inhibitor-associated OPH catalysis at specific TEA concentration showed convergent lines crossing approximately at the same point in the second quadrant ( Fig 9 ), indicating a typical linear mixed inhibition. The inset illustrated the replot of the apparent K m obtained from double-reciprocal plot against inhibitor (NaF) concentration, indicating the inhibition constant K i for NaF by the horizontal intercept. The results obtained showed a linear curve ( Fig 9 , inset), indicating that the fluoride, in the form of NaF, is a linear inhibitor of OPH activity towards DFP in the concentration range tested. The calculated K i values for NaF in the presence of 0, 100, 200, and 300 mM TEA were 3.21 ( Fig 9A ), 5.17 ( Fig 9B ), 5.45 ( Fig 9C ), and 7.51 mM ( Fig 9D ), respectively. The K i for NaF in the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP was gradually increased with the increasing TEA concentrations, kinetically suggesting the reduction of fluoride inhibition by the adding of TEA.   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.g009  Fig 9   Analysis of inhibition kinetic constant ( K i ) for fluoride (NaF) in OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP.  The inhibition analysis of fluoride was performed at the increasing triethanolamine (TEA) concentrations: 0 mM (A), 100 mM (B), 200 mM (C) and 300 mM (D). The TEA-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 25°C contained 100 μM ZnCl 2 , the initial enzyme of 10 nM and 0–3 mM NaF. At each TEA concentration, the 1/ V was plotted against 1/[DFP] under 0 mM (●), 1 mM (□), 2 mM (■), and 3 mM (○) NaF conditions. Inset shows the replot of the apparent K m obtained from the double-reciprocal plot versus inhibitor (NaF) concentrations. Each point in the plot is the average of triplicate determination with the experimental error less than 10%.     In the absence of TEA, the velocity ( V ) for OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP was decreased more quickly than that in the presence of 300 mM TEA, especially at a later reaction stage (6–10 minutes) with adding of 3 mM NaF inhibitor ( Fig 10 ). As shown in Fig 10 , the adding of 3 mM NaF to TEA-free solution at the end of the first 5 minutes reaction time led to total inhibition of OPH towards DFP in the following 2 minutes. In contrast, the V for DFP hydrolysis in OPH solution decreased much slower at 300 mM TEA during the whole reaction time (10 minutes). At a later reaction stage (6–10 minutes), the adding of 3 mM NaF to TEA-containing solution exhibited a much less inhibition against OPH activity than that to TEA-free solution ( Fig 10 ), suggesting an obvious "buffering capacity" of the aminoalcohol for fluoride. On the other hand, an obvious rate-enhancing effect on OPH catalysis towards DFP was observed with the adding of 300 mM TEA at the end of the first 5 minutes when the DFP hydrolysis was largely inhibited ( Fig 11 ).   10.1371/journal.pone.0169937.g010  Fig 10   Effect of triethanolamine on inhibition of OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP by fluoride (NaF) given at a later reaction stage.

Discussion  Organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH; EC 3.1.8.1) can hydrolyze a variety of organophosphorus (OP) compounds with P–O, P–S, P–F, and P–CN bonds [ 1 – 3 , 8 , 23 , 31 , 33 ]. However, this enzyme exhibited much lower activities towards certain OP substrates containing P-F bond, the reactive site in fatal nerve agents sarin (GB), soman (GD) and diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) [ 1 – 3 , 6 , 8 , 23 ]. Directed evolution and rational protein engineering have created desirable OPH mutants with enhanced activities to cleave the P-F bond [ 2 , 3 , 16 ]. However, choice of buffer to further enhance OPH activity towards organophosphofluoridates was rarely reported. Previous studies have documented the activation of bovine intestine alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) to degrade p -nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) in the presence of aminoalcohol and amine buffers [ 18 – 20 ]. To our knowledge there have been no reports on the effect of reaction buffer on OPH activity towards DFP, a G-type nerve agents analog. The present study reported the aminoalcohol-induced activation of OPH, as illustrated by increase of kinetic parameters k cat , V max and k cat / K m on DFP hydrolysis ( Table 1 ).  The k cat values of OPH in the hydrolysis of DFP elevated with increasing concentrations of MEA, DEA, and TEA ( Table 1 ), indicating that they could activate OPH and might be suitable buffers to effectively detoxify the fluoride-containing nerve agent. The magnitudes of the activation by different aminoalcohols, indicated by the V and k cat , were ordered in TEA, DEA, and MEA ( Fig 4 ), revealing the association of the observed activating effects with hydroxyl or hydroxyethyl group concentrations. However, alcohols, including ethanol, glycerol, and methanol, could not activate OPH ( Table 2 ), suggesting that the hydroxyl or hydroxyethyl group alone contributes little to the observed OPH activation. In contrast, all the amines investigated, including methylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, and triethylamine, had slightly activating effects on OPH activity, as observed in the change of k cat and V max at 300 mM concentration ( Table 3 ), indicating the critical role of alkyl-substituted amine (amino nitrogen) in the OPH activation. In recent years, a series of chemically synthetic OP scavengers based on organic nitrogen derivatives, including Zn 2+ -azamacrocyclic complexes [ 21 , 34 ], aminopyridine-substituted polyallylamine [ 35 ] and oxime-substituted cyclodextrins [ 22 , 36 – 38 ], have been established to eliminate pesticides and nerve agents such as parathion, paraoxon, DFP, cyclosarin (GF) and tabun. The mechanism of the reported non-enzyme catalysts exclusively involves essential nitrogen atom(s) with lone pair electrons that function as critical Lewis base to initiate catalysis. In the present study, the OPH activation mediated by amines and aminoalcohols was proposed to share the similar mechanism that the amino nitrogen in these activators could participate in the catalytic hydrolysis. On the other hand, at 300 mM, the magnitudes of the activation in k cat by diethylamine (1.4 fold) and triethylamine (1.3 fold) are not remarkable compared to that by DEA (2.4 fold) and TEA (3.6 fold), respectively (compare Tables 1 and 3 ), suggesting that the activating effects of aminoalcohols could be ascribed to the combined effects of the ethyl-substituted amino nitrogen and hydroxyl group. Further experiments indicated the requirement for coexistence of amine and alcohol groups in the same molecule regarding the observed rate-enhancing effects ( Table 4 ). Moreover, such activating effects only occurred for the aminoalcohol additives with two carbon (C) atoms between nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O), but not for 3-amino-1-propanol with more than two C atoms between N and O ( Table 5 ), suggesting some anchimeric assistance in the rate-enhancing. A similar system containing thiodiglycol rather than thiodipropanol was also rate-enhancing ( Table 5 ), confirming the putative anchimeric assistance. Here, a proper carbon-atom distance between two functional groups in aminoalcohol and its stimulant molecule was emphasized for this additive-induced activation of OPH towards DFP.  The proposed catalytic mechanism for OPH based on X-ray structure resolution suggests a critical role of an activated water molecule in the initial nucleophilic attack on the phosphoryl center of the OP substrates [ 2 – 4 , 8 – 11 ]. In the reported biochemical process, the activated water molecules have been identified to be hydroxide ions that are stabilized by metal ions (a pair of Zn 2+ ) in the enzyme active site [ 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 ]. According to the mechanism, the hydroxyl groups in aminoalcohols are likely to generate additional hydrogen bonds that would further stabilize the activated water molecules and/or phosphorus-centered transition state and thus make a faster DFP hydrolysis. Previous studies have described that the introduction of potential hydrogen bond donors to the leaving group pocket of OPH, i.e. the single site mutants F132Y and L140Y, led to substantial improvements in the rates of phosphofluoridate hydrolysis [ 2 , 3 ]. In the present study, the additives with hydrogen bond donors, including amino-N and hydroxyl-O in aminoalcohols ( Fig 3 ), also enhanced the OPH activities to considerably higher levels ( Table 1 ), also reflecting the contribution of hydrogen bond donors to the OPH activation. Another explanation for the aminoalcohol-induced activation could be a favorable hydrophilic environment created by the chemical compounds that allow for efficient fluoride (F − ) releasing. As previously reported, based on theoretical simulation and experimental mutagenesis, a proper environment transition in active site, hydrophobic to hydrophilic, desirably activated DFPase to cleavage P-F bond with a more efficient fluoride releasing [ 39 , 40 ], achieving a quadruple mutant of DFPase with significantly higher DFP-degrading activity ( k cat / K m 1.4 × 10 5 M −1 s −1 ) [ 40 ]. In the current aminoalcohol-induced activation of OPH, with the increase of k cat and k cat / K m , the apparent K m values were also increased ( Table 1 ), indicating little contribution of aminoalcohol to facilitating substrate binding. This might mean the reported activating effects of aminoalcohols occurred at the product (leaving group F − ) releasing step, rather than the DFP (substrate) binding step. Actually, the activation of DFPase towards DFP hydrolysis was predominantly attributed to an easier fluoride leaving [ 40 ], rather than an enhanced substrate binding [ 41 ]. As an additional evidence, the activating effects of aminoalcohols on OPH catalysis were also observed for diethyl fluorophosphate, the substrate with fluoride as leaving group, but not for ethyl-paraoxon, the substrate with phenolic compound as leaving group (data not shown). Thus, the acceleration of F − releasing in the aminoalcohol buffers might require proper interaction(s) between the hydrogen-bond donors and the hydrophilic leaving groups. The similar activating effects of aminoalcohols have been reported in the BIALP-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP with phosphate (Pi) as leaving group [ 18 ], also suggesting the specific interaction of aminoalcohols with the hydrophilic leaving groups.  The binuclear metal center in OPH has been evaluated to be essential for the activated hydroxide formation and catalysis initiation [ 2 , 4 , 14 ]. Dumas et al. [ 42 ] have reported the inactivation of OPH by nitrogen-containing compounds of metal chelators including o -phenanthroline, EDTA, and 2,6-pyridine dicarboxylate. In the present study, EDTA has been proved to predominantly abolish the TEA-induced activation of OPH (wild-type and mutants) regarding DFP hydrolysis ( Fig 6 ), suggesting the important role of metal center in the observed OPH activation. On the other hand, the previously reported OPH mutants F132Y and L140Y, with the best DFP-degrading activities in the past [ 2 , 3 ], have been validated to be further activated in the TEA-containing buffers ( Table 6 ). The mutated amino acid residues have been emphasized to be potential hydrogen bond donors in or around DFP-binding site for the optimum OPH activities [ 2 , 3 ]. Thus, the TEA-induced activation of OPH observed in this study could not be fully explained by the contribution of hydrogen-bond donors distributed in the aminoalcohol molecules. Here, we deduced that the activating effect of TEA might be associated with certain Zn 2+ metal center, the specific active center component other than DFP-binding site. Fluoride (F − ) has been documented as an effective OPH inhibitor by interfering with metal center required in catalysis initiation [ 14 ]. The similar fluoride inhibition was observed in the present study ( Fig 7 and Table 7 ), which was further classified as a linear mixed inhibition ( Fig 9A ). In the OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP, the product inhibition could be in part released with TEA adding ( Fig 8 ). The K i analysis of fluoride did illustrate a gradual decrease in the product inhibition against OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP with the increasing TEA concentrations ( Fig 9 ). Based on the kinetics data, we suggested that the aminoalcohol-induced activation of OPH may be associated with the reduced fluoride inhibition. In addition, the increase of K i for F − ( Fig 9 ) as well as K m for the substrate ( Table 7 ) may indicate a slow formation of some certain F − -metal complex in the OPH active-site pocket. The current kinetics data, collected in rapid equilibrium conditions (2 h of enzyme-inhibitor incubation), did give a mixed inhibitor behavior, suggesting a possible antagonistic effects of TEA and fluoride in the enzyme metal center. This class of antagonistic effects were also observed in the "buffering capacity" of 300 mM TEA against fluoride inhibitor given at a later OPH reaction stage ( Fig 10 ) and in the predominant velocity recovery for DFP hydrolysis by the adding of 300 mM TEA at the same reaction phase ( Fig 11 ), both partially indicating the involvement of metal center in the TEA-induced relief of fluoride inhibition in the OPH catalysis. Nevertheless, more detail knowledge on the metal-TEA interaction is still not clear in the current study, and some further analysis regarding the enzyme stability with fluoride might be required to uncover the mechanism involved in the TEA-induced rate-enhancing.  The application of OPH in organophosphofluoridate intoxication requires desirable hydrolase activity to cleavage P-F bond. However, the catalytic efficiencies k cat / K m of OPH towards fluoride-containing nerve agents including DFP are ranging from 1.0 × 10 4 to 8.0 × 10 4 M -1 s -1 , much lower than that towards its optimal substrate ethyl-paraoxon ( k cat / K m = 5.5 × 10 7 M -1 s -1 ) [ 8 , 11 , 39 , 43 ]. To date, the desirable enzyme(s) to degrade DFP has been recorded as squid diisopropylfluorophosphatase (DFPase; EC 3.1.8.2) with k cat / K m 1.4 × 10 5 M −1 s −1 [ 11 , 13 , 39 , 40 , 41 ] and Alteromonas organophosphorus acid anhydrolases (OPAA; EC 3.1.8.2) with about one order of magnitude higher k cat / K m (5.5 × 10 5 M −1 s −1 ) [ 44 – 47 ]. In the present study, the optimal OPH activity towards DFP has been assessed by k cat / K m 541.7 ± 12.6 mM -1 s -1 (approximately 5.4 × 10 5 M -1 s -1 ) at 300 mM TEA condition ( Table 6 ), desirably higher than DFPase and reaching at the level of OPAA, the best DFP-degrading enzyme ever reported. OPAA has been well exploited to detoxify fluoride-containing OPs and successfully encapsulated as dentritic-enzyme complexes with pralidoxime and/or atropine to protect AChE and/or cholinesterase against DFP [ 47 – 49 ]. In contrast, despite of having a wide OPs spectrum, OPH has been not so good to degrade organophosphofluoridates including DFP, somewhat reducing the practical value of this enzyme. It would be interesting to investigate if the aminoalcohols currently studied also have rate-enhancing effects on the more DFP-specific enzymes including OPAA and DFPase. Nevertheless, based on the current report, the activation of OPH by aminoalcohol buffers would be worthy of consideration to increase efficiency of OPH in the detoxification of organophosphofluoridates.   Conclusion  Monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine and other aminoalcohols with two carbon atoms between amino nitrogen and hydroxyl oxygen in molecular structure are able to activate OPH towards DFP hydrolysis, and the triethanolamine with the best activating effect might be suitable as a reaction buffer of OPH to rapidly detoxify the nerve agent with P-F bond. Our results also suggest the combined contribution of amino nitrogen and ethoxy group in the reported OPH activation. Further kinetic inhibition studies correlate the activating effect of aminoalcohol with the reduced fluoride inhibition in the DFP hydrolysis. The present work has put forward a buffer choice to enhance OPH activity to degrade fluoride-containing nerve agent, which might be beneficial to design organophosphofluoridate bioscavengers based on OPH catalysts.
