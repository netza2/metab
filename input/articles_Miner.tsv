King, Benjamin M. Woolston,  and Gregory Stephanopoulos*  Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, United States  * S Supporting Information  ABSTRACT: The 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in Escherichia coli has been highlighted for its potential to provide access to myriad isoprenoid chemicals of industrial and therapeutic relevance and discover antibiotic targets to treat microbial human pathogens. Here, we describe a metabolic engineering strategy for the de novo construction of a biosynthetic pathway that produces 1-dexoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP), the precursor metabolite of the MEP pathway, from the simple and renewable starting materials D-arabinose and hydroxyacetone. Unlike most metabolic engineering eorts in which cell metabolism is reprogrammed with enzymes that are highly specic to their desired reaction, we highlight the promiscuous activity of the native E. coli fructose- 6-phosphate aldolase as central to the metabolic rerouting of carbon to DXP. We use mass spectrometric isotopomer analysis of intracellular metabolites to show that the engineered pathway is able to support in vivo DXP biosynthesis in E. coli. The engineered DXP synthesis is further able to rescue cells that were chemically inhibited in their ability to produce DXP and to increase terpene titers in strains harboring the non-native lycopene pathway. In addition to providing an alternative metabolic pathway to produce isoprenoids, the results here highlight the potential role of pathway evolution to circumvent metabolic inhibitors in the development of microbial antibiotic resistance.  KEYWORDS: metabolic engineering, biocatalysis, MEP pathway, isoprenoid, biosynthesis, promiscuity, antibiotic resistance  Demand for inexpensive, renewable sources of commodity chemicals and high-value small molecules has increased interest in the microbial biosynthesis of secondary metabo- lites.1,2 Isoprenoids make up a class of plant and bacterial secondary metabolites with direct utility as replacements to petrol-derived commodity chemicals, drugs, and synthetic precursors of bioactive small molecules. Isoprenoids comprise well over 55 000 natural compounds including linear terpenes and cyclic terpenoids, carotenoids, and various other compounds. Given the attractive physicochemical properties of isoprenoids as advanced biofuels, fragrances, avoring agents, and pharmaceuticals, the appeal of microbial fermentations to generate isoprenoids is growing, as demonstrated by the microbial production of artemisinic acid, a chemical inter- mediate to the antimalarial drug artemisinin, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and more recently the fermentation of cane syrup to -farnesene (C15H24), a plant-based sesquiterpene with broad industrial application.3,4  Aside from their potential industrial applications, isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways are of interest in the development of antimicrobials and the understanding and treatment of antimicrobial resistance.5,6 Several antimicrobial targets have been discovered from bacterial isoprenoid biosynthesis, including 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR or IspC), which are inhibited by alkyl acetyl phosphonates and fosmidomycin analogues, respectively, to combat malaria (Plasmodium falciparum), tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuber- culosis), and other intestinal and respiratory infections resulting from Gram-negative pathogens such as E. coli and Haemophilus influenza.6 Due to strong evolutionary pressure to survive, human pathogens are likely to develop resistance to MEP pathway antagonists, as has already been reported in a lab- evolved mutant strain of E. coli bearing the S222T mutation in DXR that conferred resistance to fosmidomycin and its analogues.5 Generally, antimicrobial resistance results from genetic mutations that allow the microbe to remove a drug, via extracellular eux or direct catabolism of a drug, or to evade a drug, via mutation of the target protein to reduce the binding of a drug, or alterations in the host metabolism to bypass the target pathways entirely.710 Thus, new biosynthetic pathways for the production of isoprenoids would not only impact our access to this valuable class of compounds but also increase our understanding of the modes of resistance to isoprenoid-specic antimicrobials inherent in the potential rerouting of host metabolism.11  Two native metabolic pathways exist for isoprenoid syn- thesis: the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) path-      Figure 1.

While both pathways synthesize isoprenoids via common precursor moleculesthe constitutional isomers isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)they dier in the routes used to generate IPP and DMAPP from central carbon metabolites. The MVA pathway consumes two NADPH and three ATP to generate IPP/ DMAPP from three molecules of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA; eq 1). The MEP pathway consumes two NADPH and only two high-energy phosphates (CTP and ATP) to generate IPP/ DMAPP from pyruvate (Pyr) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP; eq 2). Considering the varied ATP requirements of the pathways and the altered redox state of the cell arising from the dierential use of AcCoA vs pyruvate and GAP, the MEP pathway converts glucose to IPP/DMAPP at 18% greater stoichiometric eciency than the MVA pathway and has garnered much interest in harnessing this increased eciency for industrial applications through metabolic engineering of bacterial hosts.12   The MEP pathway begins via an enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylative condensation of pyruvate and GAP, yielding DXP, the entry point into isoprenoid, thiamine, and pyridoxal biosyntheses (Figure 1). DXP synthesis is catalyzed by DXS, a crucial control point of DXP productivity and potential antimicrobial target.6,13,14 DXS is regulated at the genetic and protein levels, so endeavors to increase ux through this step will have to overcome feedback inhibition of DXS by IPP and DMAPP, which cannot be combatted by genetic approaches (e.g., promoter engineering and DXS overexpression) alone.15,16 Indeed, Banerjee et al. have recently shown that enzyme engineering of the recombinant Populus trichocarpa DXS active site may, to an extent, alleviate this feedback inhibition of DXS.17  Alternatively, one could envision a biosynthetic bypass of DXS to produce DXP. Indeed, an alternative metabolic shunt to DXP was found in the photosynthetic proteobacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, which produced DXP via the demethylsulfurylation of 1-methylthio-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (MTXP), an intermediate in a sulfur salvage pathway (Figure 1).1820 Through evolutionary studies, a few other alternatives to DXS have been identied, including a mutation in E. coli aceE encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit E1 with the mutation E636Q and native E. coli yajO gene, which encodes for a putative xylose reductase that may be involved in DXP thiamine starvation conditions.11,18,21 biosynthesis under Rodriguez-Concepcion, Keasling, and co-workers imported the MVA pathway into E. coli and established a dxs mutant strain with mevalonate auxotrophy.18 Using this system, the team evolved a ribB mutant strain, encoding the mutant riboavin biosynthetic enzyme RibB G108S, that reduced ribulose-5-phosphate directly to DXP through an unknown mechanism and yet unidentied reductant (Figure 1).21  We hypothesized that a systematic approach could allow for the de novo biosynthesis of DXP and bypass DXS with well- dened chemistries. Here we describe the design and implementation of a synthetic pathway to produce DXP in vivo from native metabolites other than pyruvate, GAP, or AcCoA. The approach is based on the pentose catabolism of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol-producing E. coli strains that have elevated concentrations of the reactive two-carbon substrate glycolaldehdye (GA) and three-carbon ketone hydroxyacetone (HA).2224 Stable isotope mass spectrometry metabolomics demonstrated that D-arabinose-derived GA and exogenous HA can be combined via an enzyme-catalyzed aldol addition to produce 1-deoxyxylulose as a precursor of DXP in vivo. The ability of this new pathway to overcome DXS chemical inhibition and, separately, augment the production of the nonnative isoprenoid molecule lycopene in E. coli was demonstrated. Additionally, combinatorial biosynthesis was used to establish that HA could be produced in vivo through the methylglyoxal pathway in E. coli, which would enable the consolidated fermentation of pentoses such as D-arabinose to isoprenoids in a single cell. Aside from oering a new, direct route to produce DXP from HA and D-arabinose, our results highlight potential engineering targets in the future develop- ment of this pathway for increased productivity of isoprenoids from pentoses and add credence to the broad application of chemical logic to the de novo design of metabolic pathways in live cells.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Retro-biosynthetic Design of a DXP Pathway. In order to alleviate any product inhibition at DXS by downstream MEP metabolites IPP and DMAPP, one could circumvent DXS entirely in the design of DXP biosynthesis. We hypothesized that retro-biosynthetic analysis could enable de novo DXP production as shown in Figure 2a. Retro-biosynthetic analysis applies the logic of retrosynthesis from organic chemistry to the modular reconstruction of metabolic pathways.25 Our analysis began with the insight of Wungsintaweekul et al. that DXP could be generated in vivo by the aberrant activity of the enzyme xylulose kinase (XK), encoded by the native E. coli gene xylB.26 We hypothesized that a non-native reaction with an E. coli aldolase might produce the 1-deoxyxylulose scaold by a syn-aldol addition of the donor hydroxyacetone (HA) into the acceptor molecule glycolaldehyde (GA). The native E. coli fructose-6-phosphate aldolase (FSA), encoded by the gene fsaA, was previously found to catalyze the reversible aldol cleavage of fructose-6-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate, with a preference for the aldol addition reaction (G = +32 kJmol1).27 Upon in vitro characterization of FSA, Schurmann, Sprenger, and co-workers indicated some substrate plasticity allowing for substitution of HA and GA as an aldol donor and acceptor, respectively.27 Surprisingly, this aberrant activity occurs at 18% of the eciency of the reaction between native donor dihydroxyacetone and acceptor glycer- aldehyde-3-phosphate.27,28 Crucially, Schurmann et al. detailed the stereoconguration of the aldol addition products of the FSA-catalyzed additions, including HA to GA, and they concluded that the product diols exclusively formed the syn- diasteromers, including 1-deoxy-D-xylulose (DX), rather than the anti-diastereomers, such as the C-3 epimer of DX, 1-deoxy- D-ribulose.28 Notably, DHAP was found to be an unacceptable substrate of FSA.27 Together, these characteristics detail the utility of FSA as a native E. coli catalyst for the non-native addition of HA to GA to form DX.   In order to provide HA and GA for the aldol formation of DX, we looked to known microbial sugar fermentations to two and three carbon alcohols. HA has been previously shown to be an intermediate in the fermentation of hexoses to 1,2- propanediol in E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.2932 Additionally, GA accumulation was used by Pereira et al. to augment ethylene glycol production from pentoses such as D- xylose and D/L-arabinose in E. coli.2224 At this point, a forward de novo metabolic pathway of D-arabinose conversion to DXP was parsed into an upstream module (module 1; Figure 2b) and a downstream module (module 2; Figure 2b), and the modules were separately evaluated in parallel in two E. coli strains.  A combinatorial approach enables HA production. Much work exists on the fermentation of pentoses to two- and three-carbon glycols via the intermediate overproduction of GA and HA. Pereira and co-workers previously showed that GA could be eciently obtained from D-arabinose in E. coli lacking in the general aldehyde reductase activity of the enzyme AldA, encoded by aldA (Figure 2A). E. coli aldA strains with elevated GA pools produced increased titers of ethylene glycol (EG) up to 3.4 gL1 and a corresponding yield on D-arabinose of 0.35 gg1 (0.85 molmol1 or 34% mole carbon basis).23 Notable adaptations of the system allowed for the reconstruc- tion of other pentoses such as D-xylose and L-arabinose metabolism to produce EG and glycolate.22,23 Others have shown that the natural tendency of E. coli to ferment excess dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) into the methylglyoxal (MG) shunt can be used to overproduce HA en route to the high titer synthesis of propylene glycol.3336  Given the prior conversions of sugars to GA and HA, module 1 construction began with a combinatorial screen for the two- step conversion of DHAP to HA using either E. coli MG synthase (EcMGS) or Bacillus subtilis MG synthase (BsMGS) in combination with one of three native E. coli reductases: NADH-dependent MG reductase (YdjG), NADPH-dependent MG reductase (YeaE), and NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductase (YqhD) (Table 1). Six combinations of MG synthases and reductases were constructed under control of the T7/lac promoter system using the commercial pET28 vector (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The constructs were transformed into the E. coli K12 MG1655 (DE3) aldA base strain from Pereira et al.24 (hereafter E. coli aldA), and the ability to ferment glucose into HA, as determined by HPLC analysis in comparison to an external standard of HA (Figure SI-2), was compared among the strains HA-01HA-06 (Figure 3 and Table 1). In comparison to the uninduced control, the engineered strains showed a signicant increase in the basal HA titers from 50 M up to 110 M after 24 h of growth on glucose in LB broth at 37 C. A 7-fold increase in titer to 760 M was observed when the E. coli reductase YqhD was used with BsMGS, and another 2.4-fold increase to 1.83 mM HA was observed when the MGS was exchanged for the E. coli isoform. Further evaluation of pathway induction temperature at 22 and 30 C failed to increase HA titers above those observed at 37 C (Table SI-8). From the variable temperature tests, the major factor aecting HA titers was the choice of methylglyoxal reductase, with YqhD generating the highest titers near 2 mM. Given the observed HA titers, HA production was deemed sucient to continue with examination of HA conversion to DXP in E. coli strains transformed with module 2.   Figure 2. (A) Retro-biosynthetic analysis of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5- phosphate (DXP). (B) The engineering strategy for the de novo biosynthesis of DXP in a glycolate decient E. coli host begins with the deletion of the native aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (aldA) to preclude glycolaldehyde (GA) oxidation to glycolate (denoted by the X symbol). Overexpressed enzymes include methylglyoxal synthase (MGS) and an aldehyde reductase (AR) to convert dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to hydroxyacetone (HA) in module 1 coupled to the subsequent overexpression of fructose-6-phosphate aldolase (FSA) and xylulose kinase (XK) to convert glycolaldehyde (GA) and HA into DXP in module 2.

On the right axis, the orange line and points show the mean HA titer of the cultures, demonstrating that HA toxicity (100 mM, Figure SI- 3b) is not limiting production. Error bars represent standard deviations from three biological replicates. Geneotypes of the strains are given in Table 1.    In vivo Coupling of HA and GA To Form DXP. In parallel with the construction of HA producers, module 2 (Figure 2b) was used to convert D-arabinose-derived GA and exogenous HA to DXP. To test whether FSA and XK could catalyze a chemical bypass of DXS, the genes were cloned on a pET28a backbone, yielding plasmids pDXP010 (fsa, xylB+), pDXP020 (fsa+, xylB), and pDXP030 (fsa+, xylB+) (Table 1), which were used to overexpress the proteins FSA and XK (Figure SI-1). The genes fsaA and xylB were induced while growing the cells on uniformly 13C-labeled D-glucose in the presence of unlabeled (12C)-D-arabinose and unlabeled (12C)- HA (Figure 4a). Under these conditions, the cells were initially grown on heavy D-glucose, containing only 13C. When the cells reached mid log-phase growth, the induction mixture (IPTG for the pET genes and L-fucose to induce the endogenous fucIKA pathway for D-arabinose metabolism)23,37 was added, which allowed for the overexpression of the synthetic pathway. At that point, light carbon substrates were also added. We hypothesized that incorporation of the light substrates (12C-Ara and 12C-HA) into DXP would present as a shift in the labeling ratio of heavy/light (H/L) DXP, as determined by LC-MS/MS metabolite proling, owing to the competing uxes of carbon through the native DXS vs our synthetic pathway. As native pathways also exist to allow the cells to consume the light arabinose through central carbon metabolism and form DXP through the DXS node, a basal degree of DXP lightening was expected in the presence of light carbon substrates. Given the empirical ease of observing phosphorylated metabolites via LC- MS/MS, the central carbon metabolites DHAP and phosphoe- nol pyruvate (PEP) were monitored for the purpose of evaluating the dierential use of the native vs engineered pathways for DXP production. Assuming heavy carbon remains in the system, one would expect a dierential shift in the H/L ratio of carbon isotopomers of DXP in comparison to DHAP and PEP as ux through the engineered pathway increases relatively to that of native metabolism for DXP biosynthesis, upon induction. As shown in Figure 4b, metabolite isotopomer proling of strain E. coli aldA at 24 h postinduction revealed an H/L ratio of 0.24  0.31 for DXP and 1.1  1.2 for DHAP indicating some ux of unlabeled arabinose and HA into DXP through the native metabolism. Similar H/L metabolite ratios of DXP (0.18  0.22) and DHAP (2.4  2.1) were observed when only XK was overexpressed in strain DXP-01. Upon overexpression of the FSA, a signicant shift to lighter H/L ratios was observed in the DXP pool (H/L = (2.5  3.2)  103), while the DHAP metabolite resembled the negative control (H/L = 4.3  5.2). That FSA alone enabled a lightening of the DXP pool in the absence of XK overexpression indicates that native XK activity of the cells was sucient to allow phosphorylation of 1- deoxyxlyulose to DXP. This observation is consistent with prior reports in which 1-deoxyxylulose is able to complement an otherwise lethal knockout of the dxs gene.14,26 When the FSA and XK were combined in strain DXP-03 a 105-fold lightening of the DXP pool (H/L = (6.4  4.9)  105) was observed while signicant heavy carbon remained in central metabolism as indicated in a DHAP ratio (H/L = 7.1  10.7) that was similar to the negative controls (Figure 4b). This indicated a signicant, 104-fold switch away from the use of DXS and glucose to form DXP in the engineered strains DXP-02 and DXP-03. Notably, the dierential lightening of the DXP pool of strains DXP-02 and DXP-03 in comparison to the wild type strain conrmed that DXP was formed from the unlabeled substrates HA and arabinose-derived GA.    Figure 4. (A) Labeling scheme for mass spectrometric determination of DXP origin in engineered E. coli. Metabolites are shown with circles to indicate number and connectivity of carbons, and the m/z [M  H] of the metabolites is given in the upper left corner of the three-letter abbreviations.

Native metabolism is shown in gray arrows, and the engineered pathway is shown in green. (BC) Ratio of heavy/light metabolites for engineered E. coli strains upon feeding unlabeled D-arabinose and HA to (U13C)-D-glucose grown cells. Dierential inclusion of IPTG and HA for panel C is indicated below the graph. Abbreviated genotypes are given in the inset boxes: A = EcmgsA; D = yqhD; F = fsaA; X = xylB.     Following in vivo conrmation of the FSA-mediated DXP synthesis with exogenous HA in strain DXP-03, a one-step conversion of D-arabinose into DXP was tested in which individual plasmids for pathway modules 1 (pHA011) and 2 (pDXP030) were cotransformed to form strain DXP-04. The metabolite labeling with light carbon substrates in the presence of (13C)-D-glucose-grown cells was repeated with the EV-01 strain as the negative control, and the H/L metabolite ratios were measured for PEP, DXP, and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4- cyclodiphosphate (MEC), a downstream derivative of DXP. The metabolite labeling experiment again revealed signicant DXP lightening (H/L = (3.87  0.95)  104) upon induction of the pathways with IPTG, but only in the presence of exogenously fed HA (Figure 4c). The MEC pool metabolite ratio (H/L = (4.46  3.9)  104) showed a similar prole to DXP, indicating that the DXP formed from HA and GA was further metabolized through the MEP pathway. While the results rearmed the use of FSA and XK to bypass DXS for DXP biosynthesis, the expected lightening of the DXP and MEC pools was only observed when HA was added exogenously, revealing a pathway limitation in the production of HA within strain DXP-04. Indeed, comparison of HA titers for strains DXP-04 to HA-01 that were grown in M9 media containing 2.5 gL1 glucose indicated no observable concentration of HA by strain DXP-04, while HA-01 generated 367  0.5 M HA (Figure SI-10). The reduced HA titers can be partially explained by the switch from LB-Glucose media to M9-Glucose that resulted in a decrease in HA specic titers of strain HA-01 from 0.59 mMOD cells1 in LB to 0.28 mM OD1 after 24 h in M9 media. However, strain DXP-05, which harbors the genes mgsA, yqhD, fsaA, and xylB on a single pET vector (pDXP040), produced an HA titer of 950  60 M in M9-Glucose media with a specic HA titer similar to the HA-01 strain grown in LB-Glucose media (0.67 mMOD1). The fact that strain DXP-05 produced measurable HA while DXP-04 did not could also indicate insucient MG and YqhD expression by the low-copy number plasmid pHA011.  In Vivo Utility of a DXS Bypass. We next sought to test the ability of the engineered pathway to complement a loss of DXS activity in the cell. The dxs gene is essential for growth in E. coli,38 and due to its absence from human cells, DXS has been identied as an antibiotic target in human pathogens such as E. coli, Plasmodium falciparum, and Mycobacterium tuber- culosis.6,13,14 As such, the deletion of dxs is of interest to dene engineering strategies to enhance isoprenoid metabolism and inform metabolic routes to evolve resistance to DXS-inhibiting antibiotics.  Previous eorts to disrupt DXS activity for engineering purposes have achieved moderate success and usually require dxs complementation with a DXS-encoding plasmid or supply of an auxotrophic metabolite associated with isoprenoid or thiamine production.14,18 Our initial eorts to complement a dxs mutant E. coli strain with HA and pDXP030 failed. We hypothesized that a gentler approach than the hard deletion of the dxs gene might enable the gradual switch in metabolism to support cell growth and demonstrate the eective use of the DXS bypass. We thus synthesized butyl acetyl phosphonate (BAP), which was shown to be a selective inhibitor of E. coli DXS and eective antibiotic in thiamine-free minimal media when used in combination with a cell-weakening agent like ampicillin.14 Using 1.5 mM BAP and a sublethal dose of ampicillin (8 gL1) in thiamine-free M9-glucose media, growth of the empty vector control strain (EV-01) was completely inhibited, and a combination of arabinose, HA, and IPTG did not rescue growth (Figure 5, lanes 14).50 Strain DXP-03 was also growth inhibited by BAP when only glucose and/or arabinose was fed, but the growth was rescued to 50% with HA alone or 54% with a mixture of HA and IPTG (Figure 5, lanes 58). The fact that growth rescue for strain DXP-03 was observed with HA alone and IPTG did not substantially improve the rescue suggests that basal pathway expression is enough to allow some conversion through the engineered pathway, which we believe is due to low level induction of FSA and XK in minimal media without IPTG. The lack of BAP rescue in the EV-01 strain supports this hypothesis.   Figure 5. Fractional growth of E. coli DXP strains in the presence of the antibiotic butyl acetyl phosphonate (BAP). (A) Schematic detailing BAP inhibition of DXS and the mode for rescue of engineered cells with hydroxyacetone (HA) and D-arabinose (Ara); (B) graph of the fractional growth of engineered E. coli strain in the presence of BAP, HA, Ara and the pathway inducer IPTG. Fractional growth is normalized to the EV-01 positive control (far left bar), and error bars represent the standard deviation of triplicate cultures. Abbreviated genotypes are given in the inset box: A= EcmgsA; D = yqhD; F = fsaA; X = xylB.    Strains DXP-04 and DXP-05 were also tested for the ability to rescue BAP-induced growth inhibition. Like the other strains, the cells did not grow in the absence of arabinose (Figure 5, lanes 11 and 15), nor did arabinose alone rescue the growth (Figure 5, lanes 12 and 16). Strain DXP-04 harbors plasmid pHA011, which encodes pathway module 1 on an orthogonal expression vector to module 2 (pDXP030). This strain encoded an HA pathway that should allow for growth rescue without exogenous HA; however, substantial growth rescue for strain DXP-04 was only observed when HA was fed to the cells (Figure 5, lane 12). A similar, but greater, rescue was observed for strain DXP-05, which contains the full, engineered pathway (modules 1 and 2) on a single vector: pDXP040 (Figure 5, lane 16). From these results, it is clear that HA is able to rescue cell death caused from chemical-induced DXS inhibition only when the de novo DXP pathway has been transformed into the cells.  From the metabolite proling and BAP rescue experiments, it is clear that HA feeding is necessary to enable de novo DXP biosynthesis. We hypothesized that poorly tuned FSA kinetics, rather than insucient HA productivity, could be the cause of the apparent HA limitation in the pathway. This hypothesis is borne out by the observation by Garrabou et al. that native E. coli FSA catalyzes the addition of the aldol donor HA to aldehyde acceptor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) with a Km for HA of 17.4 mM.39 Given that our best HA producing strains (HA-01 in LB-Glucose media) only reached HA concentrations of 1.8 mM (Figure 3), we hypothesized that the DXP strains were below the optimal range of HA concentrations for FSA-catalyzed addition to glycolaldehyde to generate substantial levels of DXP for cell growth under conditions of BAP inhibition of DXS. To test this hypothesis, the BAP rescue experiment was repeated using strain DXP-03, which lacks the HA module encoded by mgsA and yqhD, with HA feeding across the dynamic range of HA predicted from the MichaelisMenten kinetics of FSA acting on HA and GAP (Vmax = 34 molmin1mg1 and Km(HA) = 17.4 mM).39 Figure 6 shows the extent of BAP rescue after 46.5 h in response to varying extracellular HA concentrations. Addition of 5 mM HA allowed for growth rescue of strain DXP-03 from BAP inhibition to 42  4% that of the EV-01 control strain without BAP. This amount of growth rescue was similar to strain DXP- 05 (50  3%), which produced an extracellular HA titer of 0.96 mM after 16 h of incubation in M9-Glucose media at 37 C (Figure SI-10). As the HA concentration was increased from 15 to 45 mM and 150 mM (near and above the predicted FSA Km for HA), the fractional growth increased with a strong correlation to the predicted velocity of FSA, which is plotted on the right axis of Figure 6. There is a qualitative shift in the curve of fractional growth of the DXP-03 cells and the FSA model as a function of HA concentration such that the apparent half-saturation point of DXP-03 response is near 45 mM HA. This dierence could be explained either by the dierent partitioning of HA in and out of the cell such that the intracellular HA concentration is about 1/3 the extracellular concentration, or by a 3-fold increase in the FSA Km for HA as the acceptor aldehyde GAP is replaced here by glycolaldehyde. As the HA concentration was increased to 300 mM, no cell growth was observed, indicating the cells had crossed the toxic limit whereby HA began to inhibit growth. Interestingly, WT E. coli cells become growth inhibited at 50100 mM HA, to 1.53-fold indicating that the DXP cells were tolerant higher concentrations of HA (Figure SI-3B). Due to the toxic nature of HA near the levels of maximal FSA velocity, the optimal engineering target to improve pathway productivity of the DXP strains would be an FSA mutant with a lower Km for HA, as has proven eective in the adaptation of FSA for other non-native aldehydes and ketones.4042   Figure 6. Fractional growth of engineered cells in the presence of 1.5 mM BAP at 46 h and 37 C as a function of hydroxyacetone concentration (left axis, blue bars) and predicted FSA activity as a function of [HA] (right axis, orange line and points). EV-01 controls were grown in the absence () or presence (+) of BAP, and DXP-03 cells ( fsaA+, xylB+) were grown with BAP and increasing concentrations of HA from 0 to 300 mM. Modeled FSA velocity was generated using MichaelisMenten kinetics with constants obtained from Garrabou et al.39 for HA addition to GAP (Km = 17.4 mM; Vmax =33.7 mol min1 mg protein1). HA titer for HA-01 strain (1.8 mM in LB + Glucose) is represented by the black dotted line, and the toxic limit of HA for strain DXP-03 is given in the red dotted line (>150 mM).    To further probe the in vivo utility of the engineered DXP biosynthesis pathway, we looked to the ability of de novo biosynthesized DXP to augment carbon ux through the MEP pathway en route to isoprenoids. A common reporter system of isoprenoid pathway ux relies on the production of the tetraterpene molecule lycopene (C40H56), which is a chromophore with maximal visible light absorbance at 475 nm known for the red color it brings to tomatoes.43 The constitutive lycopene synthesis plasmid pAC-LYCipi was reported by Cunningham et al. to synthesize lycopene from IPP/DMAPP using the genes crtBEI and idi from the Gram- negative bacterium Pantoea agglomerans (formerly Erwinia herbicola).44 Strains EV-01, DXP-02, DXP-03, and DXP-05 were transformed with pAC-LYCipi forming strains LYC-01 LYC-04 (Table 1). The strains were grown on arabinose and HA with and without pathway induction, and cellular lycopene content was determined from dried cells by correlating visible light absorbance of organic cell extracts to a lycopene standard curve (Figures 7 and SI-9). The negative control strain, EV-01, showed no signicant lycopene content. Strains LYC-01 and LYC-02 showed similar basal levels of lycopene content of 224  21 ppm and 189  19 ppm, respectively, with no change upon addition of IPTG. Strain LYC-03 showed similar basal lycopene content as strains LYC-01 and LYC-02 without induction (216  14 ppm), but a 4-fold increase in lycopene content to 882  74 ppm was observed upon induction of both fsaA and xylB with IPTG. This indicates that while FSA activity alone was enough to observe DXP biosynthesis by strain DXP- 02 in metabolite labeling and growth rescue experiments, it did not support lycopene production; however, when the full module 2 pathway was induced in strain LCY-03, the pathway ux through DXP and the MEP metabolites was enough to support lycopene synthesis.   Figure 7. Lycopene content of engineered E. coli cells. (A) Schematic of the engineered pathway for the conversion of D-arabinose and hydroxyacetone to lycopene. (B) Lycopene content in ppm is shown in all strains at 24 h after induction of the engineered DXP biosynthesis pathway either without (teal) or with (orange) IPTG. Abbreviated genotypes are given in the inset box: L = pAC-LYCipi; A = EcmgsA; D = yqhD; F = fsaA; X = xylB.   The ability of the combination strain LYC-04 to combine the engineered pathway modules 1 and 2 for fermentation of arabinose to lycopene without HA was also tested (Figure 7). While only basal levels of lycopene were observed on arabinose alone (with or without IPTG), addition of exogenous HA (30 mM) upon induction of the plasmid pDXP040 presented a signicant increase in lycopene content to 2-fold the basal level (394  60 ppm). The results mirrored the metabolite proling and cell rescue experiments in which HA feeding was necessary to supplement insucient ux through pathway module 1 for DXP biosynthesis, which further highlighted FSA- catalyzed HA conversion to DX as the principal target for future engineering eorts for increased DXP and isoprenoid production. It is interesting to note that lycopene titers of LYC- 04 were 2-fold less than the LYC-03 strain, even with HA supplementation. A possible explanation is reduced productiv- ity in LYC-04 in comparison to LYC-03 owing to the increased burden of added gene expression.  In summary, we have demonstrated the synthetic potential of enzyme promiscuity and aberrant reactions in cellular metabolism. By utilizing the known promiscuity of native E. coli enzymes FSA and XK, we were able to show a redirection of DXP biosynthesis away from the native DXS node. The de novo DXP pathway was used to engineer resistance in E. coli to the DXS specic antibiotic BAP and to augment non-native lycopene production in the cell by 4-fold. The implications of this work are broader than the access of the isoprenoid precursor DXP, alone, as it opens the door to explore myriad carbon reshuing reactions in the cell by using native enzyme promiscuity to bypass critical control points of metabolism. We believe such approaches will add to the metabolic engineering and synthetic biology toolkits for unlocking the potential of secondary metabolism in the upgrading of renewable feedstocks with engineered biocatalysts. In addition to the synthetic utility of rerouting central carbon metabolism with aberrant reactions, the specic application to circumvent a potential antibiotic target in E. coli underscores the need for further insight into the role of metabolic plasticity in the evolution of microbial antibiotic resistance.   METHODS General. Agarose was purchased from Amresco (Solon, OH, USA). DNA manipulation was monitored by standard electrophoresis techniques using ethidium bromide (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to visualize the DNA under UV irradiation. Gel electrophoresis was powered by a Bio-Rad Powerpac Basic power supply (Hercules, CA, USA), and gel documentation was performed with a ProteinSimple AlphaIm- ager HP camera (San Jose, CA, USA). PCR reactions were performed on a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Dual-block gradient thermocycler. Plasmids were synthesized using standard Gibson45 (isothermal type) or golden gate46 enzyme-assisted assembly techniques, whereby the requisite enzymes, buers, and reagents were purchased from NEB and synthetic primers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (see Table SI-9). Primer designs for Gibson assemblies were facilitated using the online tool NEBuilder (NEB), and primer designs for Golden Gate assembly were obtained using the built-in suite of the web- based cloning software from Benchling (San Francisco, CA, USA). Plasmid transformants were screened by colony PCR (standard PCR using an E. coli colony, rather than puried DNA, as the template) with plasmid-specic T7 or pACYC primers. Plasmid DNA was extracted from positive clones using the Zyppy plasmid miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), and insert sequences were conrmed by Sanger DNA sequencing (Quintara Biosciences, Boston, MA, USA). Genomic DNA from WT E. coli and Bacillus subtilis (type strain 168) was obtained from growing cultures using the Mo Bio UltraClean Microbial DNA Isolation Kit as per manufacturer instructions (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Strains and Plasmids. Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 (DE3) endA recA was used as the parent strain for metabolic engineering of HA producing strains and is designated hereafter as the WT strain. E. coli WT aldA strain was reported by Pereira et al.23,24 and was used as the parent strain of DXP-producing strains. NEB 5-alpha competent E. coli (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was for routine cloning and plasmid maintenance.  Plasmid pAC-LYCipi was a gift from Francis X Cunningham Jr (Addgene plasmid no. 53279).44 Plasmid pHA001 was constructed by enzyme assisted, Gibson assembly45 of the gene fragments mgsA, which was PCR amplied from E. coli genomic DNA with primers JRKI151p001 and JRKI151p015 by Phusion high-delity DNA polymerase (NEB), and the protein expression vector pET28a, which was linearized by a digest reaction with endonucleases NcoI and XhoI in cutsmart buer. Plasmid pHA011 was constructed by a three-fragment Gibson assembly with EcoRI/SalI-linearized expression vector pACYC- duet, E. coli mgsA (amplied with primers JRKI151p067 and JRKI151p018), and yqhD (ampli ed with primers JRKI151p019 and JRKI151p068). Plasmids pHA010, pHA020, and pHA030 were prepared by three-fragment Gibson assemblies of NcoI/XhoI-linearized pET28a with E. coli mgsA (amplied with the common forward primer JRKI151p018 JRKI151p001 and variable reverse primers (pHA010), JRKI151p026 (pHA020), or JRKI151p013 (pHA030)) and E. coli yqhD (pHA010; primers JRKI151p019 and JRKI151p010), yeaE (pHA020; primers JRKI151p017 and JRKI151p008), or ydjG (pHA030; primers JRKI151p014 and JRKI151p006). Plasmids pHA040, pHA050, and pHA060 were prepared by three-fragment Gibson assemblies of NcoI/XhoI- linearized pET28a with B. subtilis mgsA (amplied with the common forward primer JRKI151p003 and variable reverse primers JRKI151p022 (pHA040), JRKI151p020 (pHA050), or JRKI151p012 (pHA060)) and E. coli yqhD (pHA040; primers JRKI151p023 and JRKI151p010), yeaE (pHA050; primers JRKI151p021 and JRKI151p008), or ydjG (pHA060; primers JRKI151p011 and JRKI151p006).  Plasmids pDXP010 and pDXP011 were prepared by Gibson assembly of BamHI/SalI-linearized pET28a and E. coli xylB amplied from genomic DNA with the common forward primer JRKI44p001 and dierent reverse primers JRKI44p002 (pDXP010) and JRKI144p003 (pDXP011). Plasmid pDXP020 was prepared by Gibson assembly of NcoI/BamHI-linearized pET28a and E. coli fsaA amplied using primers JRKI44p004 and JRKI44p005. Plasmid pDXP030 was prepared by a three- fragment Gibson assembly of NcoI/SalI-linearized pET28a, fsaA (amplied using primers JRKI44p004 and JRKII48p002), and xylB (amplied with primers JRKII48p003 and JRKI44p002). Plasmid pDXP041 was prepared by Gibson assembly of BglII/XhoI-linearized pHA011 and the fsaA-xylB dual gene fragment that was amplied from pDXP030 using the primers JRKI151p069 and JRKI151p070. Due to diculty with Gibson assembly arising from homology between ribosome binding sites in each fragment, plasmid pDXP040 was prepared by BsaI-mediated Golden Gate46 assembly of fragments pHA001 (amplied with primers JRKI151p073 and JRKI151p074), yqhD (amplied with primers JRKI151p075 and JRKI151p076), fsaA (amplied with primers JRKI151p077 and JRKI151p078), and xylB (amplied with primers JRKI151p079 and JRKI151p080).  Media Preparation, Cell Culture, and Protein Ex- pression and Analysis. LB and agar were purchased from Bacto Laboratories (Mount Pritchard, NSW, Australia) and prepared by manufacturers instructions. Isopropylthio--D- galactopyranoside (IPTG) was purchased from Gold Bio- technology (St. Louis, MO, USA), reconstituted as a 100 mM stock solution, sterile ltered through a 0.22 m syringe lter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and stored at 20 C. Other media components, solvents, and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. M9-Glucose media was prepared by combining the following components in a 1 L solution and sterile ltering with a bottle top vacuum lter (0.22 m; VWR, Radnor, PA, USA): Bacto M9 Salt base (200 mL of 5 stock), D-glucose (2.5 g), MgSO4 (2 mL of 1 M stock), CaCl2 (0.5 mL of 0.1 M stock), ATCC vitamin mixture (10 mL; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), ATCC trace minerals solution (10 mL), and 18  Milli-Q water to 1 L. Thiamine-free M9 media was prepared as above while substituting the ATCC vitamin mixture with vitamin B12 (0.5 mL of 0.037 mM stock) and 0.5 mL of a synthetic vitamin mixture comprised of 10 mM NaPhosphate (pH = 7.1), sodium 4-aminobenzoate (0.26 mM), D(+)-biotin (41 M), nicotinic acid (0.81 mM), calcium D(+)-pantothenate (0.21 mM), and pyridoxine hydrochloride (0.73 mM). Where specied, sterile antibiotic stocks were used to supplement the media with kanamycin sulfate (50 gmL1) and chloramphenicol (30 gmL1).  Cultures were transformed with synthetic plasmids using the Inoue heat-shock method47 and grown overnight at 37 C on antibiotic LB-agar plates to select for positive transformants. Single clones were subsequently grown overnight in 3 mL of LB or M9 media in a 14 mL Falcon tube (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) at 37 C in an incubator shaker. The starter cultures were subcultured at a 1:100 dilution ratio into prewarmed media for growth and/or protein expression. When induced, the cells were grown to an optical density (OD; 600 nm observed wavelength) between 0.4 and 0.6, and IPTG and other additives were added. The cells were then cultured while shaking at 250 rpm at the specied temperature and time lengths before collection of the cells or media by centrifugation or ltration. When necessary, protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis of B-Per Complete cell extracts that were prepared per manufacturers instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientic, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed under standard conditions using a BioRad power supply and precast mini-protein 12% acrylamide gels and Instant-Blue protein stain (Expedeon, San Diego, CA, USA). Protein expression for DXP cells was optimal at 100400 M IPTG and 37 C for 1224 h (Supporting Information). HA Production and Analysis in E. coli Cultures. Strains HA-01  HA-06, harboring plasmids pHA010pHA060, and WT E. coli were grown in starter cultures (LB with 50 gmL1 kanamycin; 3 mL) overnight at 37 C before subculturing into LB media (3 mL  3 cultures) with kanamycin (except for WT) and 2 gL1 D-glucose in 14 mL Falcon tubes. The cultures were grown at 37 C while shaking at 250 rpm until the OD reached 0.70.8; then, IPTG was added to 0.4 mM. After 6 h, the cells were removed by syringe ltration, and the ltrate was analyzed for the presence of hydroxyacetone (HA) by ion exchange HPLC using an Agilent-1200 HPLC system with a G1362A RID detector while running a 20 min isocratic ow of 14 mM sulfuric acid (0.7 mL/min; 50 C) through a BioRad Aminex HPX-87H ion exchange column (300 mm  7.8 mm). Data collection and peak integration were performed using Agilents OpenLAB CDS ChemStation software (version A.02.08 SP1). HA eluted at 15.1 min and was quantied in comparison to an external standard and calibration curve (Figure SI-3).  DXP Synthesis, Metabolite Extraction, and Labeling Analysis in Engineered Cells. Strains EV-01, DXP-01, DXP- 02, DXP-03, DXP-04, and DXP-05 were prepared by transformation of strain E. coli aldA with the respective plasmids listed in Table 1. The strains were cultured overnight at 37 C with shaking (250 rpm) in 14 mL culture tubes containing 3 mL of M9 media with 2.5 gL1 (12C)-glucose. The next day, 75100 L of the starter were used to inoculate 3 mL of labeled M9 media containing 2.5 gL1 U-(13C)-D- glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA). The cultures were grown at 37 C with shaking at 250 rpm until the OD = 0.60.8. The cultures were then induced with the indicated mixture of (12C)-D-arabinose (15 mM, nal concentration), (12C)-hydroxyacetone (15 mM, nal concen- tration), IPTG (80 M, nal concentration), and (12C)-L- fucose (1 mM, nal concentration). Cultures continued shaking at 37 C for 2024 h before collecting the cells for metabolite extraction. Intracellular metabolites were extracted by a variation of the method described by Muller et al.51 3 mL of cell culture were rapidly ltered onto a 47 mm 0.45 m Nylon Filter (product no. WHA7404004, Sigma-Aldrich) and washed with 10 mL of DI water. The lter was immediately immersed in 5 mL of 20 C extraction solution (acetonitrile/methanol/ water 40:40:20) in a 50 mL Falcon tube and vortexed vigorously for 30 s. After 1 h of lysis at 20 C, the suspension was centrifuged (3750 rpm, 10 min), and the supernatant was transferred to a glass test tube and dried overnight under air. The dried metabolites were resuspended in 120 L of DI H2O and centrifuged once more (20,000 rpm, 20 min), and the supernatant was taken for LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted using an API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Framingham, MA) with ESI running in negative MRM mode with an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The LC conditions were as described previously,48 with an injection volume of 20 L. Source parameters were as described by Luo et al.49 Metabolite-specic ionization and fragmentation voltages were obtained during infusion of 1 M standard solutions using the automatic optimization features of the software (Analyst 1.6) and are listed in Supporting Information Table SI 1. Integration of peaks was performed using the manufacturers software (Analyst 1.6)  BAP Inhibition of E. coli Growth and Rescue of DXP Strains. Lithium butylacetylphosphonate (BAP) was synthe- sized as described by Smith et al.13 and stored desiccated in powder form at 20 C until needed (see Supporting Information). Strains EV-01 and DXP-02  DXP-05 were grown overnight in 3 mL of thiamine-free M9 media with 50 gmL1 kanamycin (plus 30 gmL1 chloramphenicol for DXP-04) at 37 C in 14 mL Falcon tubes. The cultures were subcultured into 50 mL modied M9 media (2.5 gL1 D- glucose, no thiamine, 8 gmL1 ampicillin, 25 gmL1 kanamycin), and shaking continued at 37 C and 250 rpm in 250 mL baed asks. At OD = 0.4, the cultures were transferred to 3  3 mL cultures in 14 mL Falcon tubes. Buer additives and/or inducers were added from stock solutions to the following nal concentrations according to the specica- tions in Figures 5 and 6: 1.5 mM BAP, 30 mM D-arabinose, 1 mM L-fucose, 30 mM hydroxyacetone, 80 M IPTG, and 13 gmL1 chloramphenicol. The cultures continued to shake at 250 rpm and 37 C in a standing test tube rack over 2 days with periodic monitoring of culture ODs in a 96-well plate (part no. 89131-504, VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) using a SpectraMax M3 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with manufacturers software (SoftMax Pro 6.5). The culture ODs after 28.5 h postinduction were normalized to the BAP-free EV- 01 control.  Analysis of Cell Lycopene Content. Strains EV-01 and LYC-01  LYC-04 were grown overnight in 3 mL of M9 media with D-Glucose (2.5 gL1) and antibiotics (50 gmL1 kanamycin, 30 gmL1 chloramphenicol) at 37 C while shaking at 250 rpm. The cells were subcultured into 3  5 mL cultures (6  5 mL for strain LYC-04), returned to 37 C with shaking, and induced at OD = 0.50.6 with a mixture of  D-arabinose (30 mM), L-fucose (1 mM), IPTG (5 M for strains EV-01, LYC-01, and LYC-04; 25 M for strains LYC-02 and LYC-03), and HA (30 mM; except none added to half of the LYC-04 cultures). After 20 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation (3750 rpm  10 min), washed with water, and pelleted once more. The cells were frozen on liquid nitrogen and dried in preweighed Eppendorf tubes with a lyophilizer (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA). After recording the dry cell mass, lycopene was extracted from the cells. To extract lycopene, the cells were resuspended in 1 mL of extraction solution (1:4:5 mixture of EtOH/EtOAc/CHCl3) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with exclusion of light and intermittent mixing. The cell debris was pelleted at 15 000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was carefully transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube. The solvents were removed under a gentle ow of air for <1 h in the dark, and the residue was dissolved in 250 L of a 1:1 mixture of acetone/EtOH. 200 L of this mixture were analyzed by UV/vis spectrophotometry in a 96-well plate (Falcon, untreated) with a SpectraMax M3 plate reader (Molecular Devices) and the manufacturer software (SoftMax Pro 6.5). Lycopene absorbance at 475 nm was corrected for residual cell turbidity at 660 nm and correlated to a standard curve of lycopene (Carbosynth US, San Diego, CA, USA) from 0.510 gmL1 in 1:1 acetone/EtOH. Lycopene content of the cells was calculated as g lycopene per g cells (or ppm).

Ebrecht 1, 2, Ligin Solamen 1, Benjamin L. Hill 1, Alberto A. Iglesias 2*, Kenneth W. Olsen 1 and Miguel A. Ballicora 1*  1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States, 2 Laboratorio de Enzimologa Molecular, Instituto de Agrobiotecnologa del Litoral (UNL-CONICET), CCT CONICET, Santa Fe, Argentina  The substrate specicity of enzymes is crucial to control the fate of metabolites to different pathways. However, there is growing evidence that many enzymes can catalyze alternative reactions. This promiscuous behavior has important implications in protein evolution and the acquisition of new functions. The question is how the undesirable outcomes of in vivo promiscuity can be prevented. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from Escherichia coli is an example of an enzyme that needs to select the correct substrate from a broad spectrum of alternatives. This selection will guide the ow of carbohydrate metabolism toward the synthesis of reserve polysaccharides. Here, we show that the allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate plays a role in such selection by increasing the catalytic efciency of the enzyme toward the use of ATP rather than other nucleotides. In the presence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, the kcat/S0.5 for ATP was near 600-fold higher that other nucleotides, whereas in the absence of activator was only 3-fold higher. We propose that the allosteric regulation of certain enzymes is an evolutionary mechanism of adaptation for the selection of specic substrates.  Keywords: allosteric regulation, effectors interaction, glycogen biosynthesis, substrate promiscuity  INTRODUCTION  Enzymes exhibit a remarkable capacity to evolve and acquire new functions for the adaptation of the organism to its environment. A clear example is the fast evolution of bacteria to drug resistance strains (Khersonsky and Tawk, 2010). The connection between promiscuity and protein evolution was rst formalized in 1976 by Jensen, who proposed that ancient enzymes possessed a broad substrate specicity (Jensen, 1976). These few rudimentary enzymes acted on multiple substrates to aord a wider range of metabolic capabilities (Jensen, 1976; Khersonsky and Tawk, 2010). Later, enzyme families grew by gene duplication coupled with the acquisition of advantageous new functions (Nam et al., 2012; Pandya et al., 2014; Donertas et al., 2016). Thus, the identication of promiscuity (also called ambiguity when the chemistry is the same, Jensen, 1976; Pandya et al., 2014) provides important information about the evolutionary and mechanistic relationships among members of the same enzyme superfamily. Several studies have focused on the structural and mechanistic aspects of promiscuity, its role in the evolution of new functions, and its practical implications (Khersonsky and Tawk, 2010; Pandya et al., 2014). However, it is important to understand how the promiscuity and its physiological consequences are avoided in vivo. This is physiologically relevant because the enzyme specicity for substrates controls metabolic ow by sorting metabolites into distinct paths. In this work we studied how the promiscuity of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.27; ADP-Glc PPase) is controlled.      ADP-Glc PPase and other sugar nucleotide pyrophosphorylases belong to the nucleotidylyltransferase family. Despite large diversity existing at primary and quaternary structure levels, nucleotidylyltransferases share some common features: the catalytic domain has the same GT-A fold (Singh et al., 2012), they require a divalent cation for catalytic activity (generally Mg2+), and they share conserved residues and motifs in the active site (Fuhring et al., 2013). Analysis of known structures showed that conserved residues are in homologous locations in the active site binding the sugar nucleotide (Jin et al., 2005). For example, the glycine rich GXGXRL loop is present in most of the sugar nucleotide pyrophosphorylases described so far, and it was identied as the site of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding (Brown et al., 1999; Sivaraman et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2005; Koropatkin et al., 2005; Maruyama et al., 2007; Steiner et al., 2007; Pelissier et al., 2010). ADP-Glc PPase has a distinct characteristic of being allosterically regulated by small eector molecules (Ballicora et al., 2003, 2004). The enzyme synthesizes ADP-Glc, from ATP and glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1P), which is used for the production of storage polysaccharides (glycogen and starch) in bacteria and plants.  Previous works reported that ADP-Glc PPase has a certain degree of promiscuity toward the substrates (Preiss et al., 1966; Lapp and Elbein, 1972; Hill et al., 1991; Machtey et al., 2012; Cereijo et al., 2016), but the control of this promiscuity has not been studied. Here, we analyzed the use of alternative substrates by the ADP-Glc PPase from Escherichia coli, and how the activators, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-bisP) and pyruvate (Pyr), play a key role in substrate selection. We observed that Fru-1,6-bisP markedly increased the catalytic eciency of the enzyme toward the use of ATP and Glc-1P, restricting its promiscuous behavior. Computational studies suggest why alternative nucleotides have relatively low Km and kcat values.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Abbreviations: Glc-1P, glucose 1-phosphate; Gal-1P, galactose 1-phosphate; GlcN- 1P, glucosamine 1-phosphate; ADP-Glc, ADP-glucose; UDP-Glc, UDP-glucose; GDP-Glc, GDP-glucose; Fru-1,6-bisP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.   Chemicals Glc-1P, Gal-1P, GlcN-1P, ATP, ITP, UTP, CTP, GTP, ADP-Glc, UDP-Glc, GDP-Glc, inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and Fru-1,6- bisP were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All other reagents were of the highest quality available.  Expression and Purication of Recombinant Proteins Recombinant E. coli ADP-Glc PPase and its mutant W113A were obtained from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) transformed with pETEC and pETEC W113A vectors as previously described (Figueroa et al., 2011). Expression of the pETEC plasmid (and pETEC W113A), as well as purication of the recombinant enzymes were performed as previously described (Ballicora et al., 2002; Figueroa et al., 2011).  Protein Assay and Gel Electrophoresis Protein concentration of the puried enzymes was estimated by the UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coecient of 1.0 ml mg1 cm1(Figueroa et al., 2011). Protein electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) was performed as described previously (Laemmli, 1970). Following electrophoresis, protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.  Enzyme Activity Assays Activities were determined at 37C in both directions: NDP-Glc synthesis (assay A) and pyrophosphorolysis (assay B). In all of the assay procedures, one unit of activity (U) is dened as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 mol of product per min, under conditions described above in each case. Unless otherwise specied, conditions for the dierent assays were as follows.  Assay A. Synthesis of ADP-Glc (UDP-Glc, CDP-Glc and GDP-Glc) was assayed by following the formation of Pi (after hydrolysis of PPi by inorganic pyrophosphatase) by the colorimetric method previously described (Fusari et al., 2006). Reaction mixtures contained 50 mM MOPS-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM ATP (ITP, UTP, CTP, or GTP), 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 0.0005 unit/l yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase, the appropriate enzyme dilution and 1 mM Fru-1,6-bisP (when necessary). Assays were initiated by the addition of 1.5 mM Glc-1P in a total volume of 50 l. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37C and terminated by adding reactive malachite green (Fusari et al., 2006). The complex formed with the released Pi was measured at 630 nm with an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) EMax detector (Molecular Devices). The same procedure was followed for the analysis of enzyme promiscuity toward sugar-1P, except that in this case the dierent monosaccharide-1Ps were included in the assay mixture and reactions were started with 1.5 mM ATP.  For alternative cofactors for ADP-Glc PPase, assay were studied by performing the reaction with dierent metals in absence of inorganic pyrophosphatase, during 10 min at 37C; reaction was stopped with boiling water and 10 mM EDTA. Then, Mg2+ and inorganic pyrophosphatase were added to the samples, the reaction mixture was further incubated for 10 min at 37C, and the reaction was stopped with malachite green as described above. This was necessary due to the essential requirement of Mg2+ for activity of inorganic pyrophosphatase.  Assay B. For activity in pyrophosphorolysis direction, the enzyme was assayed with a coupled-enzyme spectrophotometric assay. The reaction mixture contained 80 mM HEPPS-NaOH pH 8.0, 10 mM Mg2+, 1 mM Fru-1,6-bisP (when necessary), 1 mM ADP-Glc (or 10 mM UDP-Glc or 10 mM GDP-Glc), 0.6 mM NAD+, 0.01 mM Glc-1,6-bisP, 2 U/ml Phosphoglucomutase, 2 U/ml Glc-6P dehydrogenase, 0.2 mg/ml BSA and enzyme in a total volume of 80 l. The reaction was initiated with 1 mM PPi and absorbance at 340 nm was followed for 10 min every 15 s at 37C using a BioTek EL808 microplate reader (Winooski, VT, USA). For inhibition assays with the dierent nucleotides, and unrestrained dynamics for 100,000 steps before data was acquired. Periodic boundary conditions were used. The cutos for non-bonding (van der Waals and electrostatic) interactions were 12 . The switch distance was 10 , and 1.0 1-4 scaling factor was used. All calculations were done using CHARMM 27 parameters (Mackerell, 2004). Molecular dynamic simulations of 10 ns were created using NAMD for each ADP-Glc PPase and NTP substrate (Phillips et al., 2005).  A second model of the E. coli ADP-Glc PPase was generated using the crystal structure of the small subunit of the potato tuber ADP-Glc PPase complex with ADP-Glc (PDB ID: 1YP4) and again the A. tumefaciens ADP-Glc PPase (PDB ID: 3BRK) as templates (Jin et al., 2005; Cupp-Vickery et al., 2008). Only subunit B of the homotetramer contained the ADP-Glc substrate. The ADP-glucose structure was used as a template to form the other NDP-Glc structures. Two Mg2+ ions were again placed in each of the subunits; the protein, NDP-Glc substrate, and ions were placed in a water box, brought to equilibrium, and 10 ns of molecular dynamics were collected following the procedure described above.  Using the Volmap tool from VMD, volumetric maps based on the weighted atomic density of each point were generated with a resolution of 0.1 . Average structures of each NTP and NDP-glucose were calculated using the last 5 ns of each molecular dynamic simulation to ensure the structures were fully equilibrated. In that part of the simulation, the simulated structures already stabilized to an RMSD of 1.8 to 2.2  from the original one (Figure S1).  RESULTS  We characterized the E. coli ADP-Glc PPase substrate specicity for ATP (forward direction) and for ADP-Glc (reverse direction). The enzyme was able to use other NTPs (Table 1) and NDP- Glc (Table 2) less eciently. As described before (Ballicora et al., 2003, 2007; Figueroa et al., 2011), Fru-1,6-bisP increased kcat and reduced the S0.5values for the substrates. Conversely, when the enzyme used an alternative NTP (UTP, CTP, and GTP) the allosteric activator had no eect on the kcat (Figure 1A, Table 1) or the S0.5 of any of these alternative substrates (Table 1). In the absence of Fru-1,6-bisP the kcat measured with UTP, GTP or CTP was 70-fold lower than that observed with ATP, whereas in the presence of the eector the maximum activity was at least 400- fold higher with ATP than with the other NTPs (Table 1). But the greater eect of Fru-1,6-bisP was to increase the apparent anity for ATP. Therefore, the best criterion of comparison is the kcat/S0.5 ratio for the native and alternative substrates (analogous to the catalytic eciency or kcat/Km for hyperbolic kinetics). In the absence of Fru-1,6-bisP, the kcat/S0.5 for all four more common NTPs were in the same range, but in its presence the ratio for ATP dramatically increased (200-fold) (Figure S2A and Table 1). A particularly interesting analog of ATP is ITP because the only structural dierence is a keto group instead of a primary amino group. The results with ITP were similar to the ones found for the other alternative NTPs (Table 3).  To further explore the functional relevance of Fru-1,6- bisP on the use of alternative NTPs, we tested the previously characterized mutant W113A (Figueroa et al., 2011). In E. coli activity was measured in at sub-saturating concentration of ADP- Glc (0.2 mM) and increasing concentration of NTP-Mg2+.  Kinetic Studies Kinetic assays were performed using specied concentrations and conditions for all reaction mixture components. Saturation curves were performed by assaying the respective enzyme activities at saturating levels of a xed substrate and dierent concentrations of the variable substrate (or eector). The experimental data was plotted as enzyme activity (U/mg) versus substrate (or eector) concentration (mM), and the kinetic constants were determined by tting the data to the Hill equation as described elsewhere (Ballicora et al., 2007). Fitting was performed with the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least- squares algorithm provided by the computer program OriginTM 8.0. Hill plots were used to calculate the Hill coecient (n), the maximal velocity (Vmax), and the kinetic constants that correspond to the activator, substrate, or inhibitor concentrations giving 50% of the maximal activation (A0.5), velocity (S0.5), or inhibition (I0.5). Values of activity in s1were calculated considering the molecular mass of the enzyme monomer (50 kDa). All kinetic constants are the means of at least three independent sets of data, which were reproducible within  10%.  Promiscuity Index Promiscuity index (I) was calculated according to (Nath and Atkins, 2008):  log  ei PN j=1 ej  ei PN j=1 ej  NX i  =1  1  log N  I =   Where N is the total of all the substrates and e = kcat/S0.5. Values of e used are listed in Tables S1S3.     TABLE 1 | Kinetic parameters for substrates of the E. coli ADP-GlcPPase in the synthesis direction.

An E. coli homotetramer model was generated using Modeler (Sali and Blundell, 1993; Eswar et al., 2007). The structure with the NTP substrate had two ATP molecules in two of the four subunits, subunit A and C. ATP, UTP, GTP, CTP, and ITP substrates were constructed and placed in the predicted active site of subunits A and C. Two Mg2+ ions were placed in the active site of all four subunits. The protein, substrates and ions were placed in a TIP3 water box that extended at least 10  beyond the protein in all directions and 0.1 M NaCl adjusted to neutralize the charge in the water box. Placement of the substrates, ions, and the generation of the water box were all assembled using the molecular graphics program VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996). The molecule was then brought to equilibrium using the molecular dynamics program NAMD (Phillips et al., 2005). The equilibration procedure involved energy minimization with and without restraints on the protein coordinates (3,000 steps each), slow heating from 10 to 310 K (30,000 steps), pressure and temperature equilibration using a Langevin piston (10,000 steps) ADP-Glc PPase, the W113 was postulated to trigger the enzyme activation upon Fru-1,6-bisP binding. Mutation of this residue disrupted the communication between the regulatory site and the catalytic site yielding an enzyme insensitive to the activator (Figueroa et al., 2011, 2013; Hill et al., 2015). W113A, even in the presence of the activator, had a promiscuous behavior similar to the WT in the absence of the activator (Figure 1). The fact that this mutant is insensitive to Fru-1,6-bisP conrms that without communication between the regulatory site and the catalytic site the enzyme loses substrate selectivity (Figure 1B). All of these results indicate that Fru-1,6-bisP increases specicity for ATP.  When the enzyme used ATP as a substrate, Fru-1,6-bisP also increased the kcat/S0.5for the second substrate Glc-1P and Mg2+ cofactor (100-fold and 10-fold, respectively, Table 1). But, Fru-1,6-bisP did not have this eect when other NTPs were used. These results indicate that the activator not only selects  the nucleotide substrate but also increases the kcat/S0.5 of the sugar phosphate. This could be an indirect eect because the sugar phosphate binds second according with the sequential Iso Ordered Bi Bi kinetic mechanism previously determined for the enzyme (Kleczkowski et al., 1993). To test the selective eect of Fru-1,6-bisP on the second substrate and the cofactor, we decided to assay alternative sugar-1Ps and divalent cations. The three metals Co2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ were eective cofactors in reactions with both ATP and UTP. In assays performed with ATP, Fru-1,6-bisP improved the kcat/S0.5 for the metals by two orders of magnitude (Figure S2C). The eect of the activator was on kcat, especially for Mg2+ (Figures 2A,C). On the other hand, the enzyme using UTP reached a higher kcat with Mn2+ and Co2+ than with Mg2+, but the enzyme was insensitive to Fru-1,6-bisP (Figures 2B,D). It has been described that ADP- Glc PPase is able to use dierent sugar-1Ps, but with much less eciency (Hill et al., 1991). To study the eect of Fru-1,6-bisP   Similar behavior was observed in the pyrophosphorolysis direction. The enzyme activity for the pyrophosphorolysis of ADP-Glc was increased by the activator Fru-1,6-bisP, but with UDP-Glc and GDP-Glc the kcat remained the same (Table 2). Since ADP-Glc PPase was able to use dierent NTPs as substrates, we hypothesized that these could inhibit the pyrophosphorolysis reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. This would be an indirect way to assess the nucleotide binding. The activity was assayed at low concentrations of ADP-Glc (0.2 mM) in presence of 1 mM of Fru-1,6-bisP and dierent concentrations of NTP- Mg2+ complexes (Table 4). In good agreement with the results described above, the activity of the enzyme was inhibited by the increased concentration of NTP-Mg2+ (Table 4). Values of I0.5 (NTP-Mg2+ concentration giving 50% of the maximal inhibition), in decreasing order GTP > CTP > UTP > ITP > ATP, were of the same magnitude for the three four nucleotides (22-11 mM). For ATP this value was approximately 4-fold lower (Table 4). This indicated that there is no dramatic dierence in apparent binding anity for the nucleotides. Consequently, the big dierences observed in catalytic eciencies for ATP are due in great part to kcat (Tables 1, 2).  It may be expected that dierences in the nucleotide base could lead to lower apparent anities for the non-preferred substrates. However, all the nucleotides have a similar S0.5 in the presence of the activator (Table 1). In the absence of the activator, the preferred substrate ATP has a much higher S0.5 than the alternative ones (Table 1). A possible explanation is based on the known fact that non-productive binding could lower Km and kcat simultaneously (Fersht, 1999). If the population of non- productive conformations increases, the apparent anity will increase but the overall rate will suer. Hence, the hypothesis is that ATP binds primarily in a productive conformation, whereas the binding of non-preferred NTPs lead to a larger population of non-productive conformations. To explore the structural feasibility of this hypothesis, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate whether these alternative nucleotides could bind in dierent conformations from ATP. It is important to note that ATP binds rst in an ordered mechanism (Haugen and Preiss, 1979; Kleczkowski et al., 1993; Jin et al., 2005), so the second substrate is not needed for ATP to be placed in the active site. To analyze the mobility when the active site was fully occupied, we later simulated the presence of NDP-Glc (substrate in the reverse direction).  The mobility of the four NTPs was visualized using volumetric maps of the atomic density. Figure 4 compares the map of weighted atomic density of each NTP. Beneath each volumetric map is the average structural representation calculated from the nal 5 ns of the MD simulation. We observed in these simulations that alternative nucleotides bind with a much higher exibility than the preferred substrate (ATP). Since there are a larger variety of conformations allowed for the alternative nucleotides, on the selectivity for this substrate, we assayed the enzyme with galactose-1P (Gal-1P) and glucosamine-1P (GlcN-1P). The allosteric activator increased the kcat/S0.5 of all sugar-phosphates (Figure S2B). Using Glc-1P as the substrate achieved the greatest kcat/S0.5, but in relative terms, the highest increase was observed with GlcN-1P.

Concentrations of Glc-1P (1.5 mM) and Mg2+ (10 mM) were saturating and assays were done as described in Materials and Methods.    It was reported that Pyr modulates the activity of E. coli ADP-Glc PPase synergistically with Fru-1,6-bisP (Asencion Diez et al., 2014). We assayed, in presence of dierent concentrations of these synergistic activators, the enzyme with UTP and ATP. Non-saturating concentrations of Fru-1,6-bisP (10 M) increased the kcat/S0.5 for ATP by 4.5-fold, but it had no eect on UTP (Figure 3). In the presence of 20 mM Pyr, the kcat/S0.5 was increased only when the enzyme used ATP as the substrate (7-fold higher). In addition, there was a synergic eect on selectivity: in the presence of Pyr and non-saturating concentrations of Fru-1,6-bisP the kcat/S0.5 was improved 20- fold for ATP. In reactions with UTP no improvement was observed.      FIGURE 2 | ADP-Glc PPase activity with different divalent cations as cofactor of the reaction.

Error bars are SD of three independent sets of data.  it is logical to assume that some will be non-productive. This would explain the kcat and apparent S0.5 values for ATP: kcat is higher because of a higher productive binding, and S0.5 is higher because a less exible binding decreases the entropy, and as a consequence, the binding will seem to be less favored. The allosteric activation may improve the interaction between the protein and the substrate to lower the S0.5, which is observed for ATP when Fru-1,6-bisP is present (Table 1). A similar behavior is observed when the substrates of the reversed direction are analyzed (Table 2). In this case, there were also signicant conformational dierences during the simulation between the preferred substrate ADP-Glc and the other NDP-Glc variants (Figure 5).

One way to prevent many of the undesirable outcomes of enzyme promiscuity is at the level of gene expression (Tremblay et al., 2006). In the present work, we show another type of control that occurs at the protein level via allosteric eects. For the E. coli ADP-Glc PPase this mechanism seems to be a simple way to control metabolic sorting. It is possible that the enzyme evolved its allosteric behavior not only to regulate glycogen synthesis, but also to acquire an eective manner to constrain its promiscuity.  ADP-Glc PPases have a common catalytic domain with other sugar nucleotide pyrophosphorylases (Jin et al., 2005; Cupp- Vickery et al., 2008; Cifuente et al., 2016). The formers generally have an extended C-terminal domain (120 to 150 amino acids) and a slightly longer N-terminal domain (1040 amino acids).  It is very possible that the fragment of 150 amino acids at the C-terminus was acquired to create new regulatory roles and/or to improve a rudimentary regulation that was already present (Asencion Diez et al., 2013b). In addition, this newly acquired domain and its regulation could have worked as a tool to enhance substrate specicity. In other words, it could have favored metabolic regulation together with the choice of the correct substrate.  In the present work we found that Fru-1,6-bisP and Pyr improve the kcat/S0.5 of E. coli ADP-Glc PPase for ATP and also for Glc-1P as long as ATP is the co-substrate. This is a novel view of allosteric eectors as playing a key role in substrate selection. In good agreement with this model, the ADP-Glc PPase mutant W113A, which is insensitive to activation (Figueroa et al., 2011), has a similar kcat/S0.5 for all nucleotides tested in this work even in the presence of the allosteric activator. These results support the idea that a major eect of the allosteric regulator is to select the correct nucleotide (ATP) to favor the production of a specic sugar nucleotide (ADP-Glc) necessary for this particular metabolic pathway (glycogen synthesis). To quantify these eects, an index of promiscuity (I) has been proposed, which computes the degree of variability between dierent substrates (Nath and Atkins, 2008). As shown in Figure 6, in the presence of the activator, the ADP-Glc PPase turns from being a highly promiscuous enzyme to be a highly specic one.   FIGURE 5 | Density volumetric map of NDP-Glc. Top-Volumetric map of ADP-Glc (green) over the last 5 ns of MD overlapped with the density volumetric map of NDP-Glc. Below-average NDP-Glc structures calculated of the last 5 ns of MD overlapped with the average structures of NDP-Glc. The template used to produce the models contains ATP only in subunit A, which is the only one shown here.  FIGURE 6 | Promiscuity indices (I) of different enzymes. I for the use of NTPs was calculated, as indicated in Materials and Methods, for TDP-Glc PPase from Salmonella enterica (Sen); UDP-Glc PPases from Xhantomonas campestri (Xan), X. citri (Xci), Streptococcus mutans (Smu) and Giardia lamblia (Gla); CDP-Glc PPase from S. typhi (Sty); ADP-Glc PPase from E. coli (Eco, black bars) and the mutant E. coli ADP-Glc PPase W113A (Eco, gray bars). For the use of different sugar-1P and divalent cations, I values were calculated for E. coli ADP-Glc PPase (black bars). I values of highly promiscuous papain and almost completely specic granzyme B were included as control.        Dierences between promiscuous and native (preferred) activities can be manifested in dierences in either kcat or Km (or S0.5). Specicity may result not only from substrate binding interactions per se, but also from appropriate positioning. Many promiscuous substrates have low kcat values due to poor positioning relative to the active sites catalytic residues (Khersonsky and Tawk, 2010; Nam et al., 2012; Donertas et al., 2016). This seems to be the case for ADP-Glc PPase, where the maximum turnover rate for ATP is greater but the apparent anity is lower when compared to alternative NTPs. Binding of the native substrate is typically mediated by enthalpy- driven interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, whereas for the promiscuous substrates, hydrophobic and other entropy-driven interactions may play a role (Khersonsky and Tawk, 2010). For instance, the existence of dierent alternative conformations may improve the apparent anity. However, if alternative conformations are unproductive, substrates will exhibit low kcat values. In our case, ATP is better positioned for catalysis than other nucleotides according to our MD simulations. This may imply a lower entropy and, as a consequence, a lower apparent anity.  This improvement of specicity for ATP (mediated by Fru- 1,6-bisP) seems to mainly occur through a dramatic change in the apparent anity. In general, to enhance the specicity of the enzyme for a substrate, it is necessary to increase the number of specic interactions in the transition state (Fersht, 1999). In this particular case, these interactions, generated by the presence of the activator, should take place between the nucleotide base and the enzyme. This is because the only dierence between the alternative substrates is found in the nucleotide base. For instance, ITP and ATP are identical, with the exception of a keto group vs. an amino group, respectively. This suggests that this amino group of the adenine base may contribute to the Fru-1,6- bisP driven increase in specicity and activation. MD simulations of the enzyme in presence of ITP show that this nucleotide varies its position when compared to ATP (Figure 7). The amino group of ATP makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen of Arg115, which is not possible for ITP. This hydrogen bond was experimentally observed in the ATP-bound x-ray structure of the potato tuber ADP-Glc PPase (Jin et al., 2005).  The frame of the MD simulation shown in Figure 7 illustrates how a slight misplacement of the substrate could aect catalysis. In panel C we observe that Arg32, which is critical for catalysis in the A. tumefaciens enzyme (Arg25) (Gomez-Casati et al., 2001), is not facing the substrate. In addition, Mg2+ is attracted by the - and -phosphates of ITP, whereas the bivalent metal is chelated by critical residues Asp142 and Asp276 when ATP is present (Frueauf et al., 2001; Bejar et al., 2006). These dierences between ATP and ITP were maintained throughout the simulation: the distance between the N of the amino group of ATP and the O of the peptide bond of Arg115 is mostly below 3 , whereas the analogous distance from the O of the keto group of ITP to the backbone of Arg115 is larger and more variable (3.24.5 )  FIGURE 7 | Positioning of ATP and ITP in the MD simulations. (A) Shows the overlap of the conformations of ATP and ITP in subunit A at the midpoint of the MD simulation. (B,C) Separately show the ATP and ITP, respectively. Structures were aligned based on the residues shown in the picture as ribbons, which are the one surrounding the substrate.  (Figure S3). Crystal structures of the enzyme in the presence of dierent nucleotides will help to explain the binding dierences. All the previous results suggest that the eector would not only act as an activator, but also as a selector to improve nucleotide specicity. In addition, Fru-1,6-bisP aected the specicity for sugar-1P. The presence of this activator increased the kcat/S0.5 for all the monosaccharide-1P tested. Nevertheless, in the presence of Fru-1,6-bisP, the enzyme promiscuity index (I) was 4-fold lower (Figure 6). It has been described that the ADP-Glc PPase uses dierent metals as cofactor of the reaction   (Preiss et al., 1966; Machtey et al., 2012; Asencion Diez et al., 2013a). Here, when the E. coli enzyme was assayed with UTP, it exhibited a greater activity in the presence of Co2+ and Mn2+ than with Mg2+ (Figure 2). Fru-1,6-bisP only aected the kinetic parameters when the reaction was performed with ATP, but there was no eect in increasing the specicity for the cofactor (Figure 6).  For ADP-Glc PPases a mechanism of allosteric activation has been described, in which hydrogen bond interactions between the loops associated with ATP binding would play a critical role (Figueroa et al., 2011; Hill et al., 2015). The Fru-1,6-bisP binds to the E. coli enzyme and transmits an allosteric signal to increase both the kcat and the apparent anity for the substrate ATP. Consequently, since this eect is only observed with ATP, Fru- 1,6-bisP increases the specicity for this nucleotide favoring the synthesis of ADP-Glc. The fact that the amino group from ATP is important for activation and selectivity correlates with the role described for the loop Pro103-Arg115 (Figueroa et al., 2011, 2013; Hill et al., 2015). This amino group is surrounded by the loop (Jin et al., 2005; Figueroa et al., 2013), which implies the possibility that local conformational changes may improve its interaction with the enzyme. Further research is needed to conrm and understand the underlying mechanism.  The regulatory loop Pro103-Arg115 is a distinct insertional element only present in allosterically regulated sugar nucleotide pyrophosphorylases (Hill et al., 2015). This insertion could have been acquired as a tool for evolving both a regulatory role and a less promiscuous enzyme. The concept for controlling specicity  by allosteric interactions may also apply to other enzymes. For instance, it has been described that in ribonucleotide reductase the specicity for NDP substrates is controlled by allosteric means (Ahluwalia et al., 2012; Hofer et al., 2012). Exploring this behavior in other enzymes will help to understand how broadly this phenomenon is in nature.

An alternate hypothesis is that this process is facilitated when the progenitor enzyme acquires a second function while maintaining the original activity. This phenomenon has been suggested to occur in the o-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS) from a species of Amycolatopsis that catalyzes not only the physiological syn-dehydration reaction of 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate but also an accidental racemization of N-acylamino acids [Palmer, D. R., Garrett, J. B., Sharma, V., Meganathan, R., Babbitt, P. C., and Gerlt, J. A. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 4252-4258]. To understand the molecular basis of this promiscuity, three-dimensional structures of liganded complexes of this enzyme have been determined, including the product of the OSBS reaction and three N-acylamino acid substrates for the N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR) reaction, N-acetylmethionine, N-succinylmethionine, and N- succinylphenylglycine, to 2.2, 2.3, 2.1, and 1.9  resolution, respectively. These structures show how the active-site cavity can accommodate both the hydrophobic substrate for the OSBS reaction and the substrates for the accidental NAAAR reaction. As expected, the N-acylamino acid is sandwiched between lysines 163 and 263, which function as the catalytic bases for the abstraction of the R-proton in the (R)- and (S)-racemization reactions, respectively [Taylor Ringia, E. A., Garrett, J. B, Thoden, J. B., Holden, H. M., Rayment, I., and Gerlt, J. A. (2004) Biochemistry 42, 224-229]. Importantly, the protein forms specific favorable interactions with the hydrophobic amino acid side chain, R-carbon, carboxylate, and the polar components of the N-acyl linkage. Accommodation of the components of the N-acyl linkage appears to be the reason that this enzyme is capable of a racemization reaction on these substrates, whereas the orthologous OSBS from Escherichia coli lacks this functionality.   This research was supported by Grants GM-52594 (to J.A.G. and I.R.), AR-35186 (to I.R.), and GM-55513 to H.M.H. from the National Institutes of Health. Use of the Argonne National Laboratory Structural Biology Center beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, under Contract W-31-109-ENG-38.   The X-ray coordinates of the o-succinylbenzoate synthase from Amycolatopsis complexed with o-succinylbenzoate (1SJB), N-acetyl- methionine (1SJA), N-succinylmethionine (1SJC), and N-succinylphen- ylglycine (1SJD) have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.   Divergent evolution of enzyme function is commonly explained by a gene duplication event followed by mutational changes that allow the protein encoded by the copy to acquire a new function. In one variation, the progenitor catalyzes a single reaction, but an alternate chemical reaction is achieved following a limited number of mutations. In a second variation, the gene duplication event is preceded by a period of gene sharing during which the enzyme is functionally promiscuous, i.e., it catalyzes multiple reactions. After gene duplication, the promiscuous reaction catalyzed by the copy provides a selective advantage if improved activity is accessible by a small number of mutations. Many examples of naturally promiscuous enzymes are known, thereby supporting the likely importance of the second variation (1). In earlier work it was demonstrated that the o-succinyl- benzoate synthase (OSBS)1 from a species of Amycolatopsis catalyzes not only the physiological syn-dehydration reaction but also an accidental N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR) reaction (Scheme 1; 2, 3). This OSBS is a member of the muconate lactonizing enzyme (MLE) subgroup of the mechanistically diverse enolase superfamily (4). In this group, two lysine residues are located on opposite faces of the active sites of these enzymes at the ends of the second and sixth (cid:226)-strands in a ((cid:226)/R)7(cid:226)-barrel domain. In the OSBS reaction, Lys 163 at the end of the second (cid:226)-strand initially functions as the base that abstracts the R-proton from the substrate and then as the acid that facilitates the departure of the (cid:226)-hydroxyl group; Lys 263 at the end of the sixth (cid:226)-strand likely stabilizes the enediolate intermediate. In the NAAAR reaction, Lys 163 and Lys 263 participate in a two- base-mediated 1,1-proton transfer reaction. This functional promiscuity is possible because the active sites can accom- modate the substrates for both reactions, and the serendipi- tously positioned lysine residues can catalyze either reaction as dictated by the structure of the bound substrate.   1 Abbreviations: APS, Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory; PEG, poly(ethylene glycol); NAAAR, N-acylamino acid racemase; MLE, muconate lactonizing enzyme; OSBS, o-succinylben- zoate synthase; OSB, 4-(2 -carboxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyrate or o-succinyl- benzoate; SHCHC, 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-car- boxylate; SBC, The Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL; OSB, 4-(2 -carboxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyrate or o-succinylbenzoate; rms, root-mean-square; rmsd, root-mean-square deviation.    Scheme 1: Reactions Catalyzed by the OSBS from Amycolatopsis    In this paper, we report structural studies of the promiscu- ous OSBS/NAAAR in the presence of 4-(2 -carboxyphenyl)- 4-oxobutyrate or o-succinylbenzoate (OSB), the product of the OSBS reaction, as well as three N-acylamino acid substrates for the NAAAR reaction, N-acetylmethionine, N-succinylmethionine, and N-succinylphenylglycine to 2.2, 2.3, 2.1, and 1.9  resolution, respectively. These structures reveal the molecular basis for the observed promiscuity and show how the active-site cavity can accommodate both the substrate for the OSBS reaction and the substrates for the accidental NAAAR reaction. They also show how this enzyme is able to utilize its diametrically opposed lysine residues (Lys 163 and Lys 263) for the different acid/base- catalyzed reactions. This suggests that one route for the evolution of the diverse reactions catalyzed by members of the enolase superfamily likely occurred via adventitious binding of the substrate for a different reaction in the active site of the progenitor followed by subsequent mutations that enhanced the promiscuous activity.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Protein Expression and Purification of Wild-Type OSBS- Amycolatopsis. The 1.11 kb gene encoding the OSBS from Amycolatopsis sp. T-1-60 was cloned into the pET17b plasmid as described before (2). A frozen stock of BL-21 cells transformed with the gene encoding the OSBS in the pET17b vector was used to inoculate 5 mL of LB-Amp, which was shaken overnight at 37 (cid:176) C. Two 2 L flasks of LB-Amp were inoculated from the overnight growth and shaken at 30 (cid:176) C for 36 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min at 4 (cid:176) C to harvest the cells. The cells were resuspended in (cid:24)200 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then sonicated at 0 (cid:176) C with a power of 6 for 5 s intervals followed by a 10 s delay, repeated 120 times. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15000g for 45 min at 4 (cid:176) C).  The supernatant was loaded onto a (2.6 (cid:2) 70 cm) of DEAE- Sephacel resin (Cl-) at 4 mL/min. The column was washed with 800 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient over 1800 mL of 0% to 100% 1 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Fractions containing OSBS were identified by OD280 and SDS-PAGE, and those fractions were combined. The protein solution was then dialyzed into 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the protein was then loaded in aliquots (no more than 100 mg per run) onto a 6 mL Resource-Q anion-exchange column (Cl-) and eluted with a 240 mL linear 1 M NaCl gradient (15% to 50% 1 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Fractions containing protein as assessed by SDS-PAGE and OD280 were combined and concentrated, and the mass (39 406.4 g/mol) was confirmed by ESI-MS to within experimental error (yield ) 150 mg, assuming an extinction coefficient of 33 240 M-1 cm-1, >98% pure).  Preparation of Se-Met OSBS. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was prepared in order to be able to solve the phase problem with multiple wavelength measurements at the selenium edge. A frozen stock of BL-21 cells containing the gene encoding the OSBS in the pET17b vector was used to inoculate minimal medium (2 L) containing K2HPO4(cid:226)3H2O (33 g), KH2PO4 (3 g), (NH4)2SO4 (2 g), D-glucose (16 g), MgSO4(cid:226)7H2O (0.4 g), CaCl2(cid:226)2H2O (20 mg), FeSO4(cid:226)7H2O (100 mg), thiamin (0.1 g), and ampicillin (0.2 g). The solution was shaken at 37 (cid:176) C until OD600 (cid:25) 0.6 AU (approximately 8-10 h). An aliquot was removed, and a methionine suppression solution (40 mL) containing L-Lys-HCl (200 mg), L-Thr-HCl (200 mg), L-Phe-HCl (200 mg), L-Leu-HCl (100 mg), L-Ile-HCl (100 mg), and L-Val-HCl (100 mg) was added. The flask was returned to 37 (cid:176) C to shake for 30 min, after which time IPTG (238 mg) and SeMet (Acros; 100 mg) were added. The flask was allowed to shake at 30 (cid:176) C for (cid:24)36 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min at 4 (cid:176) C to harvest the cells, and the protein was then isolated and purified as described for the wild-type enzyme (yield ) 80 mg assuming an extinction coefficient of 33 240 M-1 cm-1, >98% pure). The extent of substitution was determined by ESI-MS, which showed that (cid:24)98% of the methionine residues in the protein contained seven selenium atoms.  Crystallization and Data Collection. A search for crystal- lization conditions at both room temperature was conducted by utilizing an in-house sparse matrix screen composed of 144 conditions and at 4 (cid:176) C via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion. The best crystals were observed growing at room temperature from poly(ethylene glycol) 8000 at pH 8.0. Large single crystals were subsequently obtained by macroseeding batch experiments (5) with final precipitant concentrations of 8-9% PEG-8000 buffered with 100 mM HEPPS (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM OSB or substrate, and enzyme concentrations of 7.0 mg/mL. Crystals achieved maximum dimensions of 1.2 mm (cid:2) 0.7 mm (cid:2) 0.6 mm in approximately 2-4 weeks. They belonged to the space group R32 with unit cell dimensions of a ) b ) 216.0  and c ) 261.0  and contained four subunits in the asymmetric unit. The crystals were harvested by first introducing a solution containing 12% PEG-8000, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM NaCl, 125 mM KCl, and 25 mM OSB or N-acyl substrate directly into the batch experiments. Thereafter the crystals could be transferred directly into the same solution. X-ray data were recorded from frozen crystals. Prior to freezing, the crystals were serially transferred into final cryosolution composed of 24% PEG-8000, 25 mM MgCl2, 500 mM NaCl, 125 mM KCl, 25 mM substrate/inhibitor, and 15% ethylene glycol.

X-ray diffraction data were recorded by utilizing synchro- tron radiation from the Structural Biology Center beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Labora- tory. For each complex, 180(cid:176) of data were recorded with a frame width that varied from 0.6 to 0.8(cid:176) depending on the mosaic spread of the crystals. The data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 and Scalepack (6). Details of the data collection statistics are given in Table 1.  Structural Analysis. A three-wavelength MAD experiment was used to determine the protein structure of the complex with OSB. The positions of the selenium sites (27 of 28 possible) were determined with SOLVE (7). The positions, occupancies, and temperature factors of these sites were refined with SOLVE, yielding an overall figure-of-merit of 0.42. Manual inspection of the selenium sites revealed the positions of the four subunits. The relationship between the subunits was used for cyclical averaging with solvent flattening by use of DM in the CCP4 program package (8, 9), giving a figure of merit of 0.92 for the averaged electron density map. One complete subunit was built into the averaged electron density map with TURBO (10). The model was then expanded back into the crystallographic cell and refined with TNT (11). Other structures were solved by Fourier difference analysis and refined in a similar manner. Least-squares refinement statistics for each of the models are presented in Table 2.  The quality of the models was assessed with the program Procheck (12). A Ramachandran showed that, for the OSB complex, 90.7% of nonglycine and nonproline residues fall in the most favorable region, 9.0% fall in the additionally allowed region, and 0.3% fall in the generously allowed region. The quality of the other models is listed in Table 2. A representative section of electron density is shown in Figure 1.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Four structures of the promiscuous o-succinylbenzoate synthase from Amycolatopsis were determined. These struc- tures include complexes with OSB, the product of the OSBS reaction, and three N-acylamino acids, N-acetylmethionine, N-succinylmethionine, and N-succinylphenylglycine. As noted earlier, this OSBS is promiscuous and is able to catalyze both the OSBS reaction and the racemization of N-acylamino acid derivatives (3, 13). Since the mechanism of the OSBS reaction is better understood than the racemi- zation reaction, the structure of the product complex will be described first, followed by the three complexes with the N-acylamino acid derivatives.  Structure of the OSB Complex. The electron density for the OSB complex is essentially continuous for the entire length of the polypeptide chain, starting from Lys 2 and terminating at either Gly 367 or Ser 368 for all of the four subunits in the asymmetric unit. As expected, the structure consists of a large central domain composed of a ((cid:226)/R)7(cid:226)- barrel and a capping domain built from components from both the N- and C-termini (Figure 2).  The sequences of the ((cid:226)/R)7(cid:226)-barrel domains for the Amycolatopsis and E. coli OSBS share 27% identity and 42% similarity, but the sequences of the capping domain are more divergent (data not shown). Overall these proteins share 16% sequence identity. As expected, the topology of the OSBS from Amycolatopsis is essentially identical to that of the enzyme from E. coli (Figure 3) (14). Superposition of the structures of the OSB complexes of these enzymes confirms that the barrel domains are very similar. The rms difference between 95 structurally equivalent residues in the barrel is 1.3 , where the barrels extend from Arg 105 to Pro 290 in the enzyme from E. coli and from Pro 131 to Ser 318 in the enzyme from Amycolatopsis.  The OSBS from Amycolatopsis contains 368 amino acid residues and is somewhat larger than that from E. coli, which consists of 320 residues. Most of these additional residues are located in the capping domains with approximately 20 additional residues on either side of the central ((cid:226)/R)7(cid:226)-barrel domain. As a consequence, the structures of the capping domains are more divergent, although their overall topologies are very similar. The major differences arise in the lengths of the loops that connect the strands of sheet that dominate this domain. Many of these extensions contribute to the higher oligomeric state of the enzyme from Amycolatopsis.  5720 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 19, 2004  Thoden et al.

The figure was prepared with the program Molscript (18).  FIGURE 3: Stereo overlap of the R-carbons of the OSBS complexes from Amycolatopsis and E. coli. The enzyme from Amycolatopsis is depicted in blue whereas that from E. coli is colored in red. The coordinates for the product complex were taken from the RCSB with accession number 1FHV and superimposed with the program Align (19). The figure was prepared with the program Molscript (18).  In contrast to the monomeric enzyme from E. coli, the OSBS from Amycolatopsis assembles as an octamer with 422 symmetry (Figure 4). In the crystal lattice, the 4-fold axis of the octamer is coincident with a crystallographic 2-fold axis, which thus reduces the contents of the crystal- lographic asymmetric unit to four subunits. Extensive contacts exist between subunits in the octamer. Indeed, 2545 2 of surface area is buried per subunit in the macromo- lecular assembly as measured with the program GETAREA (15). The insertions in the sequence between Ala 120 and Ser 129 and between Lys 85 and Lys 100, relative to the OSBS from E. coli, contribute significantly to the oligomer interface, although the extensions at the C-terminus starting at (cid:24)Val 333 are not involved in any protein-protein interfaces.  Comparison of the Binding of OSB in the OSBSs from Amycolatopsis and E. coli. The electron density for o- succinylbenzoate is well-defined in all subunits of the product complex of the OSBS from Amycolatopsis (Figure 1B). As expected from the previously determined structure of the OSBS from E. coli complexed with OSB, the active site contains a single magnesium ion that is coordinated to only one carboxyl oxygen atom of the product (14). In addition N of the catalytic acid and base, Lys 163, lies 3.5  from C2 of OSB. N of Lys 263 lies 3.3  from C2 of OSB on the opposite side of the product and is believed to provide electrostatic stabilization of the enediolate intermediate (16). The product as a whole is located in a large pocket created by the loops at the C-terminal ends of the (cid:226)-strands of the TIM barrel. A mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains form the surface of the pocket to complement the functionality of the substrate and product. The hydrophobic component is provided by Phe 19, Phe 23, Met 50, Tyr 55, Met 292, and Ile 293, whereas the succinyl carboxylate forms distant polar interactions with Arg 299 (mediated by water molecules) and the amide hydrogen of Ile 293. In addition, O3 of the succinyl moiety forms a hydrogen bond with O(cid:231) of Ser 135.  The positions of the three carboxylate ligands for the metal ion, Asp 189, Glu 214, and Asp 239 (161, 190, and 213 in the enzyme from E. coli), are very similar in the OSB complexes of both enzymes. Likewise, the position of the catalytic acid/ base for the OSBS reaction, Lys 163 (133 in the enzyme from E. coli), is very similar in both enzymes, as is the location of the lysine on the opposite side of the active site, Lys 263 (163 in the enzyme from E. coli), which likely provides electrostatic stabilization of the enediolate intermediate (3, 16). Overall, these five functional residues may be superimposed with an rms difference of only 0.32 .  Surprisingly, the orientation of OSB in the binding pocket is quite different in the two complexes (Figure 5). When the active sites are aligned on the basis of the secondary structural elements of the barrel, the metal binding ligands align reasonably well; however, the benzene rings of the OSBs are displaced from each other by an average distance of approximately 2.0  and are inclined to each other with an angle of (cid:24)45(cid:176) . Furthermore, the orientation of the succinyl component of OSB is different in the structures (Figure 5A).   In the case of the complex of the enzyme from E. coli, the succinyl carboxylate is directed toward the interior of the barrel, whereas in the complex with the enzyme from Amycolatopsis the carboxylate is directed away from the barrel axis. This latter orientation for the succinyl moiety is possible because the final (cid:226) strand of the barrel ((cid:226)8) is considerably shorter than that in the enzyme from E. coli. Furthermore, in the OSBS from Amycolatopsis the loop that connects (cid:226)8 to the capping domain is shifted away from the barrel axis to create a cavity that can accept the succinyl side chain (Figure 5B). This difference in structure may contribute to the ability of the enzyme from Amycolatopsis to bind the N-acylamino acid substrates for the racemase reaction.  Structures of the OSBS from Amycolatopsis with Three N-Acylamino Acid Substrates. The structures of complexes of the OSBS from Amycolatopsis with N-acetylmethionine, N-succinylmethionine, and N-succinylphenylglycine have been determined to 2.3, 2.1, and 1.9  resolution, respec- tively. This series of substrates was chosen because they show increasing levels of activity in the racemase reaction (range of 3000-fold), with the rate for N-succinylphenyl- glycine approaching that of the OSBS reaction (3). The electron density for each of the substrates is unequivocal (Figure 6) and reveals how the active site can accommodate each of these molecules. The active site was expected to contain a mixture of enantiomers for each compound, although an equal population of enantiomers was not expected. Thus, each substrate was built as a single enan- tiomer that best matched the electron density. It was observed that the predominant enantiomers in the active site were N-acetyl-(S)-methionine, N-succinyl-(R)-methionine, and N- succinyl-(R)-phenylglycine.  As seen in Figure 7A, all three N-acylated amino acids bind in the active site in a manner that generally overlaps with OSB; however, the positions of the R-carbons vary. The location of that in N-succinylphenylglycine is anomalous relative to the N-acylmethionine substrates and will be discussed separately. As a general feature, the succinyl carboxylate moieties of N-succinylmethionine and N-suc- cinylphenylglycine lie in the same location as that occupied by the equivalent carboxylate in OSB.  Structure of the N-Acetylmethionine Complex. As shown in Figure 7B, the N-acetylmethionine moiety lies sandwiched between lysines 163 and 263, which function as the catalytic bases for the abstraction of the R-proton in the (R)- and (S)- racemization reactions, respectively (3). In this complex the R-carbon is located 3.4 and 3.2  away from Lys 163 and Lys 263, respectively. The overall conformation of the polypeptide chain that surrounds the active site is essentially identical to that seen in the complex with OSB. Indeed, within experimental error the metal coordination site is identical in N-acetylmethionine and OSB complexes. As was observed in the complex with OSB, the amino acid carbox- ylate forms a monodentate interaction with the magnesium ion that will be discussed in more detail later.  The remainder of the N-acetylmethionine lies within the cavity that binds OSB. The methionine side chain is encompassed by the same groups required to bind the phenyl ring of OSB, including Phe 23, Met 50, Tyr 55, and Met 292. The orientation of the N-acetyl moiety is somewhat variable among the four molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, but in no case does either the amide nitrogen or carbonyl oxygen form a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the polypeptide chain. Rather, this moiety extends into the cavity that contains the succinyl moieties of OSB and the N-succinyl substrates.   FIGURE 4: Ribbon representation of the complete octamer for OSBSfrom Amycolatopsis for the complex with OSB. View is looking down the noncrystallographic 4-fold axis, which is coincident with a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The active sites may be identified by the locations of the metal ions and product depicted in space-filling and ball-and-stick representations, respectively. The figure was prepared with the program Molscript (18).   5722 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 19, 2004  Thoden et al.  FIGURE 5: Stereo comparisons of the binding of OSB to the OSBSs from Amycolatopsis and E. coli (MenC), which reveal the differences in the coordination of the succinyl moiety in the active sites of the respective enzymes. Panel A shows a closeup view of the metal binding ligands and the active-site lysine residues. Panel B shows the difference in the position of the eighth (cid:226)-strand that allows the succinyl moiety to adopt an extended conformation in the enzyme from Amycolatopsis. The enzyme from Amycolatopsis is depicted in yellow whereas that from E. coli is drawn in blue. The figure was prepared with the program Bobscript (17). The coordinates for the E. coli OSB complex were taken from the RCSB with accession number 1FHV (14).    Structure of the N-Succinyl-(R)-Methionine Complex. Although both N-acetylmethionine and N-succinylmethionine bind to the active site in approximately the same location, the positions of the R-carbons differ even though the overall conformation of the polypeptide chain that surrounds the active site is essentially identical in both complexes. These differences allow better coordination of the N-succinyl moiety as shown in Figure 8A. In this complex the amide hydrogen is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly 291, whereas the succinyl carbonyl oxygen is hydrogen- bonded to O(cid:231) of Ser 235. The R-carbon is located 2.9 and 3.5  away from Lys 163 and Lys 263, respectively, where the carbon is located closest to the R-specific base as expected for the R-enantiomer observed in the active site. The succinyl carboxylate moiety of N-succinylmethionine lies in the same location occupied by the equivalent car- boxylate in OSB (Figures 7A and 8A) and forms hydrogen bonds to two well-defined water molecules. One of these water molecule is hydrogen-bonded to O(cid:15)2 of Glu 294 and NH2 of Arg 299, whereas the second is hydrogen-bonded to NH1 of Arg 299. The polar interactions of the amide linkage and succinyl carboxylate provide an explanation for the lower values of KM for the N-succinyl amino acids relative to the shorter N-acetylmethionine that lacks the water-mediated interaction with Arg 299 (3).  Interestingly the metal coordination in both the N- acetylmethionine and N-succinylmethionine complexes is monodentate as is observed for OSB complex. This is in contrast to the coordination of SHC observed in the K133R mutant of the OSBS from E. coli (16), where the coordination is clearly bidentate. The present structures are expected to be those of enzyme-substrate complexes; however, in all likelihood the coordination at the enediolate intermediate will be bidentate because this geometry would lead to greater electrostatic stabilization. If this assumption is correct, the substrate must move as the R-proton is abstracted, as was also suggested from the structure of SHCHC bound to the K133R mutant of the E. coli protein (16).    FIGURE 6: Stereoview of the omit electron density for the N-acyl substrates. Panels A-C show the density for N-acetylmethionine, N-succinylmethionine, and N-succinylphenylglycine, respectively. The maps were calculated with coefficients of the form Fo - Fc map and were contoured at 3(cid:243) where the substrate and metal ion were omitted from the refinement and phase calculation The figures were prepared with the program Bobscript (17).    Structure of the N-Succinylphenylglycine Complex. The structure of the N-succinylphenylglycine complex is anoma- lous because the substrate is displaced from the positions observed in the complexes with OSB and both N-acylated methionines (Figures 7A and 8B). In addition, no metal ion is observed in this complex, even though it was included in the crystallization mixture at the same concentration as in the other complexes. This coordination is seen in all four subunits in the asymmetric unit. This is ironic because N-succinylphenylglycine is a better substrate in the manganese- dependent racemase reaction than either N-acetylmethionine or N-succinylmethionine (3). There is no obvious explanation for the different conformation or absence of metal ion; however, it has previously been shown that, in the absence of substrate, OSBS from E. coli does not bind metal ions tightly (14). Thus since the substrate does not bind with its carboxylate in the correct place it is not surprising that no metal ion is observed. As such this structure should be viewed as a nonproductive complex that illustrates range of ligand binding conformations that are available to this active site.   FIGURE 7: Stereo superposition of (A) OSB, N-acetylmethionine, N-succinylmethionine, and N-succinylphenylglycine and (B) the active- site residues of the OSB and N-acetylmethionine complexes. In these figures OSB, N-acetylmethionine, N-succinylmethionine, and N-succinylphenylglycine are depicted in yellow, green, blue, and red, respectively. The coordinates for the entire protein were aligned starting from the active-site residues utilizing the program Align (19).     As can be seen in Figure 8B, with the exception of Met 50, all of the side chains that constitute the active site are similar in the complexes with both N-succinylphenylglycine and N-succinylmethionine. In particular, the coordination of the succinyl moiety is identical in both complexes, thereby providing evidence for potential plasticity in substrate binding.  Comparison of N-Acylamino Acid Complexes with the OSBS from E. coli. Overlap of the structures of the complexes of the N-acyl substrates on the structure of the OSBS from E. coli complexed with either OSB (data not shown) or SHCHC (Figure 9) may explain why the enzyme from Amycolatopsis has promiscuous racemase activity whereas the enzyme from E. coli does not. Clearly both active sites can accommodate the metal-liganding carboxylate group and R-carbon. Likewise, they both have catalytic acids and bases in appropriate locations to perform a racemization reaction. The hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme from Amycolatopsis appears somewhat less restricted than that of the enzyme from E. coli due to the location and orientation of the loop between Pro 18 and Ser 27 (Gly 16-Lys 25 in the enzyme from E. coli). However, this difference should not prevent the acceptance of smaller amino acid side chains by the latter enzyme.  The most significant difference between these two en- zymes resides in the manner in which the enzyme from Amycolatopsis binds the amide bond of the amino acid substrate and accommodates the N-acyl moiety (Figure 8A). As noted earlier, the conformation of the succinyl moiety in OSB is different in the complexes with the two enzymes where the succinyl moiety is in an extended conformation in the enzyme from Amycolatopsis. This extended conforma- tion is more consistent with the planar conformation of the amide linkage observed in the N-acylmethionine substrates. In addition, at least for the N-acylsuccinyl substrates, it provides hydrogen-bonding partners for the amide hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen on opposite sides of the ligand-binding pocket. Of these, the interaction between O(cid:231) of Ser 135 and the carbonyl oxygen is particularly notable. This type of interaction is not available in the enzyme from E. coli because the equivalent side chain is Leu 109. In principle, the interaction with the amide hydrogen provided by the carbonyl oxygen of Gly 291 in the enzyme from Amycolatopsis could be provided by the main-chain oxygen of Ser 263 in the enzyme from E. coli; however, the conformation and position of the backbone in the latter protein would force the substrate carbonyl oxygen into the hydrophobic environ- ment provided by Leu 109. Furthermore, the main-chain atoms surrounding Ser 263 in the enzyme from E. coli lie (cid:24)1.8  away from the equivalent atoms around Gly 291 in the enzyme from Amycolatopsis. This implies that the active site in the enzyme from E. coli is somewhat wider than that of the enzyme from Amycolatopsis, which imposes more difficulty in coordinating an amide linkage of an N-acylamino acid by ligands on opposite side of the active-site pocket.   FIGURE 8: Stereoviews of (A) the N-succinylmethionine complex and (B) the superposition of the N-succinylmethionine and N-succinylphenylglycine complexes. Panel A shows the interaction distances between N-succinylmethionine and the ligand binding site. Panel B shows that N-succinylphenylglycine binds anomalously in the active site without inducing any major changes in conformation of the side chains. This demonstrates the ability of the active site to coordinate a variety of ligands. N-Succinylmethionine and N-succinylphenylglycine are depicted in red and blue, respectively. The figure was prepared with the program Bobscript (17).    FIGURE 9: Stereoview of the superposition of the N-succinylmethionine from the Amycolatopsis complex on the structure of the 2-succinyl- 6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC) complex with the OSBS from E. coli. The N-succinylmethionine and its associated Ser 135 are depicted in blue, whereas the protein from E. coli and SHCHC are colored in yellow and white, respectively. The latter was obtained as a complex with the K133R mutant in which the catalytic base was eliminated that prevented the reaction from occurring. This reveals that the enzyme from E. coli should be able to readily accommodate most of the components of a N-acyl substrate, except for the carbonyl oxygen of the amide linkage. The coordinates for the E. coli complex were taken from the RCSB with accession number 1R6W (16).  Finally, it should be noted that although the protein from E. coli does not exhibit racemase activity against N- acylmethionine substrates, it may be able to racemize other, as yet unidentified, compounds that are more complementary with the binding pocket.   CONCLUSIONS  New enzymatic functions likely evolve most readily from a precursor that shares some functional characteristic with the new activity. Furthermore, the progenitor may have some basal level of the new activity prior to the gene duplication event, which facilitates improvement of function when selective pressure is applied. In the case of the OSBS from Amycolatopsis, this enzyme does possess two activities, although it is unknown whether the natural OSBS activity or the promiscuous NAAAR activity came first. Perhaps other orthologous OSBSs exhibit promiscuous behavior, although this has not yet been evaluated. The availability of active-site structures for the OSBSs from both E. coli and Amyolatopsis may allow identification of other substrates that will be racemized by one or both of these enzymes.  Comparison of the structures of the enzymes from Amy- colatopsis and E. coli reveal different structural solutions for binding the substrate and product for the OSBS reaction. For example, the conformation of the succinyl moiety is not chemically coupled to the dehydration reaction so it is not forced to adopt a unique conformation. In addition, the identities of the amino acid residues that form the hydro- phobic pocket for the hydrophobic regions of the substrate and product for the OSBS reaction are not conserved. We hypothesize that divergent evolution of OSBSs from different immediate ancestors likely provides opportunities for the coexistence or appearance of promiscuous reactions.  The challenge now is to discover, or even predict, whether other OSBSs or other members of the mechanistically diverse enolase superfamily that likely arose by divergent evolutions from a limited number of progenitors catalyze adventitous reactions that utilize conserved active-site functional groups to catalyze acid/base reactions with natural, but nonphysi- ological, or even unnatural carboxylate substrates.

Brammer and Caren Freel Meyers*  Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins UniVersity School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205  cmeyers@jhmi.edu  Received August 24, 2009  ABSTRACT  A study of DXP synthase has revealed exibility in the acceptor substrate binding pocket for nonpolar substrates and has uncovered new details of the catalytic mechanism to show that pyruvate can act as both donor and acceptor substrate.  Members of the isoprenoid class of natural products are all biosynthesized from the common precursors isopentenyl py- rophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). The mevalonate-independent 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phos- phate (MEP) pathway was identied as an alternative to the mammalian mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway for the production of these essential isoprenoid precursors.1 This pathway to isoprenoids is widespread in plants and human pathogens, including the majority of human bacterial pathogens2 and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum,3 and is under intense investigation as a potential target for the development of new anti-infective agents and herbicides.4  Figure 1. DXP synthase catalyzed rst step in the MEP pathway.  The rst enzyme in the MEP pathway (Figure 1), 1-deoxy- D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase, represents a new class of thiamine-dependent enzymes that catalyzes the formation of DXP from pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (D-GAP). This transformation is reminiscent of transketolases and decarboxylases, where a two-carbon intermediate bound to thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) is condensed with an acceptor substrate to generate a new carbon-carbon bond. Homologues of DXP synthase include transketolase and acetolactate synthase which are known to follow the classical ping-pong kinetic mechanism, where release of CO2 from the thiamine-bound intermediate pre- cedes binding of the acceptor substrate. In contrast, DXP synthase follows an ordered kinetic mechanism,5 where binding of the second substrate, D-GAP, is required for release of CO2 and formation of a kinetically competent complex. Interestingly, structural analysis of DXP synthase indicates the active site is located between domains of the same monomer of the homodimer, in contrast to its homo- logues, where the active site is at the dimer interface.6 Taken together, these studies reveal distinctive characteristics of DXP synthase, placing this enzyme in the growing list of potential targets for anti-infective drug development.  We have hypothesized that a study of DXP synthase substrate specicity will disclose important substrate binding determinants to help dene the substrate binding pockets and reveal previously undiscovered catalytic activities of this novel enzyme class. Existing assays used to study DXP synthase substrate specicity involved laborious TLC resolu- tion of radioactive products7 or insensitive UV- or refractive index-based detection of unnatural products.8 These studies suggested the enzyme processes a small subset of aldose and aldose phosphate acceptor substrates, closely resembling the natural acceptor substrate. While the scope of substrates that could be tested was limited by these assays, the results nevertheless suggested a potential utility of DXP synthase for generating 1-deoxysugars.  Reports describing the incorporation of uorophores to enhance sensitivity of detection use harsh and/or labor- intensive derivatization protocols9 or do not resolve substrates from products.7 Reports are lacking on tolerance of this important enzyme class toward structurally diverse substrates. To more thoroughly explore the scope of DXP synthase catalytic activity, a sensitive and exible assay is needed. Here, we report a versatile, robust HPLC-based assay for DXP synthase and present results demonstrating its utility for probing new reactions catalyzed by DXP synthase from Escherichia coli. Notably, our results indicate that DXP synthase demonstrates a valuable capacity to process non- polar aliphatic aldehydes that are structurally distinct from the natural substrate. Additionally, our assay has uncovered new details of the catalytic mechanism of DXP synthase. Here, we provide the rst direct evidence to support the hypothesis formulated by Eubanks and Poulter5 that a second molecule of pyruvate can bind to DXP synthase. We further demonstrate that DXP synthase, in fact, utilizes pyruvate as the second substrate in the generation of acetolactate.  For sensitive detection of DXP synthase activity in this HPLC-based discontinuous assay, we have exploited the reactivity of the carbonyl groups in both substrates and product toward 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNP) to give the corresponding hydrazones (Figure 2). Derivatization reactions were performed by treating quenched enzymatic reaction mixtures with excess 2,4-DNP in sulfuric acid at room temperature. Hydrazone formation was found to be complete within 2-3 min (Figure S2b, Supporting Informa- tion). Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the phosphoryl moieties in D-GAP and DXP was noted in derivatization mixtures after 30 min. Thus, derivatization reactions were adjusted to pH 5-7 after 5 min to prevent degradation. Hydrazone mixtures were then easily resolved and detected using HPLC equipped with a UV photodiode array detector. For rapid sample analysis, we have employed the use of a short Rocket column such that HPLC analysis is complete within 10 min for each sample.  Figure 2. (a) Derivatization of DXP synthase substrates and product with 2,4-DNP and (b) HPLC time-course analysis.    Conrmation of DXP formation was accomplished fol- lowing treatment of DXP synthase enzymatic reaction mixtures with Antarctic phosphatase (AP) and comparison of the resulting product to authentic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose hydrazone (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Optimization of the enzymatic reaction conditions was also possible using this assay because both substrates and products can be detected by HPLC. Importantly, we found that pyruvate and D,L-GAP are unstable in buffers often used in DXP synthase assays,7,10-13 including Tris and glycylglycine. Enzymatic reactions carried out at pH 8.0 in HEPES or phosphate buffer were found to be optimal, as substrates are stable under these conditions.  Further validation of this assay was accomplished through Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of DXP synthase in the presence of natural substrates. Kinetic parameters were measured for pyruvate and D-GAP (Figure S4, Supporting pyruvate ) 1.1 (D-GAP ) 226 ( 32 M, Km Information; Km 0.3 mM, kcat ) 246 ( 13 min-1) and were found to be in close agreement with reported values for DXP synthase from Rhodobacter capsulatus.5    Previous studies have demonstrated that DXP synthase utilizes glyceraldehyde (GA) as the acceptor substrate, indicating a tolerance for absence of the phosphoryl moi- ety.5,12,14,15 We have conrmed this result using our assay. However, little is known about the effects of removing substrate hydroxyl groups or lengthening the carbon chain. This work focuses on investigating enzyme exibility toward aliphatic aldehydes as alternative acceptor substrates.  Initial experiments tested acetaldehyde (3) as substrate for DXP synthase. The enzyme-catalyzed formation of acetoin (15) was measured by HPLC detection of the corresponding hydrazone derivative (Figure 3). Acetoin formation was conrmed by comparing the product to authentic acetoin hydrazone and by mass analysis. An apparent kcat/Km of (7.0 ( 0.2)  102 M-1min-1 was measured for acetaldehyde that is comparable to glyceraldehyde (kcat/Km of (21 ( 0.3)  102 M-1min-1, Table 1), revealing relaxed specicity for simple, nonpolar acceptor substrates.  Table 1. Summary of DXP Synthase Substrate Specicity toward Aliphatic Aldehydes  Figure 3. Analysis of acetaldehyde (3) as an alternative acceptor substrate. (a) HPLC time course showing acetoin (15) formation. Acetolactate (16) forms in the presence and absence of 3. (b) Proposed mechanisms to form 15 and 16.    In addition, a second enzyme-dependent peak was ob- served (6.7 min, Figure 3a). Mass analysis of the hydrazone product was consistent with the hydrazone of acetolactate (16). In principle, acetolactate could be formed in a reaction of the thiamine-bound intermediate with a second molecule of pyruvate, similar to the reaction catalyzed by acetolactate synthase16 (Figure 3b). The acetolactate hydrazone was observed at 6.7 min, as well as a second peak corresponding to the acetoin hydrazone. These results are consistent with a  mechanism involving reaction of the thiamine-bound inter- mediate with a second molecule of pyruvate to form acetolactate, which then undergoes decarboxylation to form acetoin (Figure 3b). In a previous kinetic study of DXP synthase,5 the rate of CO2 release was found to be signi- cantly slower in the absence of D-GAP, providing evidence for an ordered kinetic mechanism. However, in the presence of high pyruvate concentrations, slow release of CO2 was observed. The authors speculated that a second molecule of pyruvate may bind to the active site to promote CO2 release from the thiamine-bound intermediate leading to a ThDP- acetaldehyde complex that could dissociate and allow ad- ditional binding of free ThDP.5 Our results provide the rst direct evidence that pyruvate acts as acceptor substrate to promote CO2 release and generate a new product, acetolac- tate.  The observation that acetoin is generated from pyruvate, in the absence of acetaldehyde, led us to seek further proof that acetaldehyde acts as acceptor substrate to generate acetoin independently. The rate of acetoin formation from pyruvate is 10-fold lower in the absence of acetaldehyde. Nevertheless, to rule out any uncertainty about the capacity of DXP synthase to use acetaldehyde as acceptor substrate to generate acetoin, the enzyme was incubated with pyruvate and acetaldehyde-d4. As expected, formation of the corre- sponding acetoin-d4 hydrazone was observed (Table S1, Supporting Information).  The results obtained in these preliminary experiments encouraged us to expand the scope of these studies to examine DXP synthase substrate promiscuity toward other aldehydes. Notably, DXP synthase exhibits similar reaction proles in the presence of several alternative aliphatic aldehydes (results summarized in Table 1). Propanal (4), butanal (5), pentanal (6), and hexanal (7) are utilized by the enzyme (Figures S4-S8, Supporting Information), indicating DXP synthase is considerably tolerant of long-chain acceptor substrates. Specicity constants were measured for these substrates and compared to D-GAP (1), GA (2), and acetaldehyde (3) (Table 1). A nearly 400-fold decrease in kcat/Km results from the removal of the phosphoryl moiety from D-GAP, indicating the contribution of the phosphoryl moiety in substrate binding. However, removal of either hydroxyl group of GA or lengthening the carbon chain has only modest effects on kcat/Km values, demonstrating a exibility in this binding pocket for lengthening the carbon chain and removal of hydroxyl moieties. This nding indicates that DXP synthase exhibits a relaxed specicity toward nonpolar aldehyde substrates, rivaling that of TK,17 to generate the corresponding R-hydroxy ketones, an im- portant compound class in the life-science industry.18,19  Not surprisingly, heptanal (8, Table S1, Supporting Information) proved to be insoluble under these assay conditions. Branched aliphatic aldehydes are apparently not readily accepted by DXP synthase. Although minor product formation was observed in the presence of (cid:1)-branched aldehyde 9 and cyclopropyl aldehyde 10 (Figures S9 and S10, Supporting Information), more bulky R-branched al- dehydes were not processed by the enzyme. Apparent binding of pentanal to protein was observed, indicating that accurate determination of specicity constants for longer chain aldehydes under these conditions will be difcult.  In summary, the lack of an appropriate assay combining the sensitivity and exibility needed to study DXP synthase has imposed limitations in the exploration of substrate promiscuity. We have developed a robust HPLC-based assay that permits the detection of both substrates and product and provides the sensitivity required for detection of compounds that are not inherently chromophoric. Derivatization of carbonyl-containing substrates and products is complete within 2-3 min, and HPLC analysis for the reactions studied here could be accomplished within 10 min. We have used this assay to begin exploration of DXP synthase substrate promiscuity, and to resolve uncertainties about the catalytic mechanism.  Our ndings reveal relaxed specicity of DXP synthase for nonpolar aliphatic aldehydes, with the exception that bulky R-branched aldehydes are not well-tolerated by the enzyme. This relaxed specicity to produce R-hydroxy ketones points to DXP synthase as a potential biocatalyst for generating this important compound class and newly reveals exibility in the acceptor substrate binding pocket for nonpolar substrates. The perplexing observation that CO2 release takes place in the absence of D-GAP, albeit at signicantly reduced rates,5 was resolved during the course of our investigation. The assay reported here enabled the detection of enzyme-catalyzed acetolactate formation, pro- viding conrmation that pyruvate acts as the second substrate to promote CO2 release in the absence of D-GAP. Our ndings raise new questions about opportunities to target this unique enzyme or to exploit it as a biocatalyst. Studies are underway to expand the scope of this reaction.  Acknowledgment.

PLoS Comput Biol 12(1): e1004705. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004705  Editor: Bernhard O. Palsson, University of California San Diego, UNITED STATES   Received: June 17, 2015  Accepted: December 14, 2015  Published: January 28, 2016  Abstract  Recent insights suggest that non-specific and/or promiscuous enzymes are common and active across life. Understanding the role of such enzymes is an important open question in biology. Here we develop a genome-wide method, PROPER, that uses a permissive PSI- BLAST approach to predict promiscuous activities of metabolic genes. Enzyme promiscuity is typically studied experimentally using multicopy suppression, in which over-expression of a promiscuous replacer gene rescues lethality caused by inactivation of a target gene. We use PROPER to predict multicopy suppression in Escherichia coli, achieving highly sig- nificant overlap with published cases (hypergeometric p = 4.4e-13). We then validate three novel predicted target-replacer gene pairs in new multicopy suppression experiments. We next go beyond PROPER and develop a network-based approach, GEM-PROPER, that integrates PROPER with genome-scale metabolic modeling to predict promiscuous replacements via alternative metabolic pathways. GEM-PROPER predicts a new indirect replacer (thiG) for an essential enzyme (pdxB) in production of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (the active form of Vitamin B6), which we validate experimentally via multicopy suppression. We perform a structural analysis of thiG to determine its potential promiscuous active site, which we validate experimentally by inactivating the pertaining residues and showing a loss of replacer activity. Thus, this study is a successful example where a computational investigation leads to a network-based identification of an indirect promiscuous replace- ment of a key metabolic enzyme, which would have been extremely difficult to identify directly.        Author Summary Many enzymes can perform secondary functions at low affinities or rates, but such pro- miscuous functions have never been predicted on a genome-wide scale. Here, we present the first genome-wide method to predict promiscuous functions of metabolic genes, which we apply to E. coli. Notably, we predict and validate several new cases where a replacer gene can compensate for the loss of an essential target gene through a promiscuous activ- ity. Next, we couple our method with a genome-scale metabolic model, in order to search for replacer genes that compensate for essential target genes by metabolically bypassing them. We use this network-augmented approach to uncover a novel promiscuous pathway for the production of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (the active form of Vitamin B6) in E. coli. This study represents an important step in understanding promiscuous functions in bacte- ria, and is a prime example of a systems-level analysis leading to new biological insight.  Introduction Enzymes have traditionally been associated with discrete activities [1]. Clear-cut annotations populate well-known enzyme databases such as KEGG and Uniprot, and foster an implicit assumption that gene activities are specific. However, recent advancements in our understand- ing of evolution and enzyme activity have cast this view into question, and suggest instead that non-optimized and/or promiscuously active enzymes are frequent and active across life [2]. Generalist enzymes (i.e., those carrying more than one function) have been shown to be abun- dant, to play different biological roles than specialist enzymes, and to behave differently than specialist enzymes during switches in media conditions [3]. Promiscuous enzyme activities (i.e., those that are only active with low affinities/activities) have been shown to play adaptive biological roles (e.g., [4] and [5]), and to often arise through neutral mutations that are not det- rimental to the primary enzymatic activity [6]. In particular, antibiotic resistance may emerge initially through the action of over-expressed, promiscuous genes [7, 8].  Because of recent conceptual and modeling advances, there is significant interest in being able to predict and exploit enzyme promiscuity [912]. Tools have been developed that mine molecular signatures or three-dimensional catalytic domains of enzymes to predict whether enzymes are promiscuous [1315], and these methods have been used, e.g., to design likely ret- rosynthetic pathways [9, 11]. While these methods achieve important goals, they have not been aimed at evaluating the functional implications of existing promiscuous activities on a genome- wide, network scale. A notable recent effort did probe the global relevance of promiscuous enzyme activities, but the study used as is data collected from enzyme databases, which, while having the advantage of being fully experimentally verified, include many non-biologically-rel- evant instances and exclude many biologically relevant ones [16]. Another recent study used knowledge gaps identified in a genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli to identify candidate isozymes, which display substrate promiscuity [17]. In that study, a target enzyme that is found to be nonessential in vitro despite being essential in silico is knocked out, after which potential isozymes that are found to be upregulated are cumulatively knocked out until the cell can no longer survive. This method thus identifies enzymes with a secondary isozyme function that, when the cell overexpresses them, can compensate for the loss of the target. Interestingly, in one case they consider, the target is in fact essential, and adaptive evolution is required for the potential isozyme to be expressed enough to compensate for its loss. Searching for many more such low activity promiscuous functions in an unsupervised, genome-wide way is the focus of this present study.  To accomplish this, we utilize an unsupervised PSI-BLAST based method for assessing potential secondary functions of genes in E. coli. We predict promiscuous replacer functions that may compensate for primary target functions in other genes if they are altered or lost, and compare these predictions to known cases in which an over-expressed gene can take on a secondary role, as shown in an assay generally referred to as multicopy suppression [18]. Multi- copy suppression reveals replacer genes whose over-expression suppresses the lethality caused by knocking out conditionally essential target genes. It is thus an elegant assay for uncovering promiscuous gene functions. We find that our method for predicting promiscuous functions successfully recapitulates known multicopy suppression events [8, 19] and predicts new ones, several of which we validate in vitro.  We next develop a genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEM) based approach to predict and experimentally test cases of multicopy suppression in which functional promiscuous replace- ment happens indirectly through a bypassing pathway or reaction, rather than by directly replacing the function of the target gene. For this, we focus on the gene target pdxB, for which multiple promiscuous replacers have been reported in the past [8]. PdxB is a key enzyme for producing pyridoxal 5-phosphate (the active form of Vitamin B6), an essential nutrient in E. coli. Our experiment proceeded in 4 steps: First, we predicted that the gene thiG harbors a pro- miscuous activity that metabolically bypasses pdxB. Second, we validated this prediction with a new in vitro individual multicopy suppression experiment. Third, we performed a detailed structural analysis of ThiG and hypothesized which residues perform the promiscuous func- tion. And Fourth, we mutated this active site and confirmed loss of pdxB replacement activity. Thus, we begin at the level of a genome-wide screen for promiscuous functions, and proceed to identify and validate a promiscuous pathway for production of an essential nutrient in E. coli, which could have important functional implications for this model organism.  Results Developing an enzyme PROmiscuity PrEdictoR (PROPER) We aimed to predict promiscuous functions of genes in a systematic and unsupervised manner, and specifically to do it on a genome-wide scale. We started by doing permissive PSI-BLAST based searches for distant gene similarities across RAST, a large consistent database of meta- bolic reactions and compounds that includes thousands of microbes [20]. This search allowed us to assign putative secondary functions for each initial root gene in the search (see Methods and Fig 1). We did this across metabolic genes in E. coli, which resulted in a set of phylogenetic trees, one for each root gene, that include up to thousands of genes from other bacteria along with their associated functions.  Using these trees, we searched for instances in which a gene in one of the trees had an assigned function different from the one that the RAST database assigns to the root gene. We restricted our search to genes whose primary functions are metabolic, as this is our focus of interest. Since our tree building method was more permissive than typical BLAST or PSI- BLAST, we considered these predicted functions as potential secondary functionalities that might only be effective at high expression levels or with slight mutations. We entered these cases in a large gene-by-function matrix.   Fig 1. Schematic of prediction framework for promiscuous replacers. (1) Gene similarity trees are built around each gene in E. coli, including any distantly related gene in the RAST database. (2) A matrix is formed which links genes with their primary functions and also potential promiscuous functions. A gene (in this example, eco1) will take a potential secondary promiscuous function in the matrix if its similarity tree includes any genes annotated with different functions (e.g., in this example, shi4, which encodes function fn4). (3) Cases in which a genes predicted promiscuous function is identical to the function of another gene in E. coli constitute predicted direct target-replacer gene pairs (via PROPER). We also predict indirect target-replacer pairs where a replacer bypasses the targets function (via GEM-PROPER). (4) Promiscuous activity of a replacer gene can be confirmed for target-replacer pairs in which the target is conditionally essential on a minimal medium, via the multicopy suppression assay.    To facilitate testing and validation, we used our promiscuity matrix to predict pairs of genes that correspond to those identified through an in vitro assay called Multicopy suppression [19]. Multicopy suppression tests replacer genes for promiscuous activities that either directly (cat- alyze similar reactions) or indirectly (catalyze distinct reactions) replace the function of a target gene and preserve growth. It proceeds in four steps: (1) a target gene is identified in the bacterium of interest (target genes must be essential on a certain test medium [usually M9], but not on a rich medium); (2) a strain is created in which the target gene is inactivated (due to the condition in step 1, this strain is not viable on the test medium); (3) a library of native genes (hereafter called replacers) is individually over-expressed in the organism on high-copy plasmids; and (4) transformed strains are grown on the test medium, and survivors are noted as having identified successful target-replacer gene pairs. Importantly, the replacer genes are native to the genome of the organism, but their natural expression dosage is not sufficient to promiscuously support growth. Hence, replacer genes discovered through multicopy suppres- sion are hypothesized to possess secondary, low-affinity/low-activity functions that compen- sate for the function of the target. We predict target-replacer pairs in two ways: direct replacements, and indirect replacements.  To predict direct replacements, we search our matrix for instances in which one replacer gene in E. coli has a secondary function assigned through our method, which corresponds exactly to the function of some other target gene that is also found in E. coli. We call this straightforward method the enzyme PROmiscuity PrEdictoR, or PROPER.  To predict indirect replacements, we use the added insight of a GEM of E. coli (obtained from SEED: [21]). The SEED E. coli GEM was used, as opposed to one of the highly curated E. coli GEMS such as [22], because of our requirement that metabolic reactions from the SEED database can be seamlessly added to the GEM to test their effect on cellular fluxes (which would first require a large reconciliation of nomenclature if using a non-SEED GEM). Specifi- cally, we search for replacers that, through a promiscuous function identified in our matrix, metabolically bypass the need for the target. These predictions were done in three steps: (1) we knocked out the target gene in a GEM (this could only be done for genes that were condition- ally lethal on M9 in silico); (2) we searched in our gene similarity trees for any E. coli genes that harbor non-E. coli promiscuous functions; (3) we added each of these promiscuous functions in turn to the GEM, and looked for any that rescued in silico growth. This GEM-based PRO- miscuity PrEdictoR (GEM-PROPER) thus identified indirect replacer genes that act through metabolism (see panel 3 of Fig 1).  In all, PROPER predicted 2811 direct target-replacer pairs in E. coli, encompassing 794 met- abolic target genes and 753 metabolic replacer genes (see S1 Table). GEM-PROPER predicted a total of 98 indirect target-replacer pairs in E. coli (see full list in S4 Table). Since direct replacers span a large portion of metabolism, we focus on these predictions for our large-scale analyses (i.e., the first several sections of the results). Afterwards, we shift our focus to GEM-PROPER, and present a detailed analysis of a novel indirect predictor that we validated.  Systems-wide testing of PROPER The number of direct replacers per target follows an exponentially decaying distribution (see S1 Fig), implying that promiscuous gene functions cluster around key target functions. The tar- get genes with the most putative replacers are involved in fatty acid degradation or synthesis [fadD and fadK (degradation); fabD (synthesis)], or transport processes [malF (maltose/malto- dextrin transport); potC, ydcV, potB, and ydcU (spermidine/putrescine transport); and cysW (sulfate transport)]. Fatty acid degradation and synthesis processes are known to involve enzymes with many potential specificities depending on only small alterations [23].  To validate our direct predictions, we collected results from two studies of multicopy sup- pression in E. coli, which between them had discovered 48 instances of multicopy suppression among 21 target genes [8, 19]. Both of these assays looked for multicopy suppressors of targets that were essential on M9 medium but not in a rich medium, and one used a combinatorial assay that assessed every gene in E. coli as a potential replacer [19]. All but 3 of the target genes for which replacers had been found were metabolic, supporting our focus on metabolism. In all, we predicted a total of 63 replacers for the 21 targets, versus the 48 found previously by multicopy suppression. The replacers we predicted overlapped with those found previously by 8 genes. Notably, for each of the 21 target genes, there were over a thousand metabolic genes that could serve as potential replacers; therefore, the chance of achieving this level of overlap between our predictions and those found experimentally through random guesses is extremely low (p = 4.5e-15 in a hypergeometric test).  As another control test, we performed a BLAST search of each target gene identified in Pat- rick et. al. against all metabolic genes in E. coli, and kept only those above the default threshold as potential replacers. This yielded 122 predicted replacers for the 21 target genes, among which none matched results from Patrick et. al., and only two overlapped with predictions made by PROPER (neither of those turned out true in our own experiments). This emphasizes the added value of PROPER over simple BLAST searches for finding find such low affinity pro- miscuous functions.  We also considered it possible that some of our target-replacer predictions are true, but can-  not be verified using multicopy suppression because the target gene is not conditionally lethal (which is a necessary condition for doing a multicopy suppression experimentsee Fig 1, panel 4). As a quick test of this, we compared our direct predictions to the isozyme sets aspC/tyrB, argD/astC/gabT/puuE, and gltA/prpC, which were discovered in [17] as described in the intro- duction. Indeed, all 8 pairwise combinations of genes from within any of these 3 isozyme sets comes up as a reciprocal target-replacer pair in our direct predictions, meaning that either gene in each pair can play the role of the target or the replacer. That all of these pairs would come up in our predictions and, given that, that they would all be reciprocal are both highly unlikely by chance (p = 3e-19 and p = 3e-5 in hypergeometric tests, denoting that all pairs from [17] (a) overlap our predictions vs. a background of all-vs.-all pairings of our predicted targets and replacers, and (b) are reciprocal, assuming the same likelihood for any pair). This suggests that promiscuous functions that have enough activity to be considered isozymes (or, more specifi- cally, to be defined so through the experimental pipeline in [17]) may tend to come up in our predictions as reciprocal, and suggests a complimentary association between our methods and those in the aforementioned work.  Testing novel predicted direct replacers via new multicopy suppression assays The random gene insertion method used by Patrick et al. to screen for potential target-replacer pairs [19] is demonstrably not comprehensive (e.g., 7 replacers were found for pdxB in [8]; none of these were reported in the Patrick study for pdxB, although pdxB was in the set of replacers that Patrick et al. tested). Hence, we next asked how many of our novel predicted tar- get-replacer pairs (those that had not been previously found experimentally) may be true. To test this we developed a single-replacer multicopy suppression assay analogous to that used to validate individual results in the initial multicopy suppression study by Patrick [19]. This assay involves plating target-replacer strains (i.e., strains with the target knocked out, and the replacer over-expressed on a plasmid) on M9 medium, and observing how long it takes for col- onies to appear. We judged successful target-replacer pairs as those that grew more robustly than an empty plasmid control (see Methods, as well as Supplementary methods in S1 Text for a fuller explanation of this assay).  Using these criteria, we verified 7 of the 8 target-replacer pairs that were identified in Patrick  et. al. and predicted by PROPER (see S2 Table for full list of experimental results). We then assessed each of our 55 novel predicted target-replacer pairs for multicopy suppression, and found three of them to have replacer activity (hisA, cysM, and metB were viable replacers for hisH, ilvA, and metC respectively; see S2 Table). Thus, in all we validated 10 out of 63 direct replacement predictions, which gives a success rate of 20% (after eliminating 14 predictions for ptsI and glyA target genes, which were in practice untestable because the target knockout did not decrease growth from wt in our experiments; see S1 Text). Among the three validated novel target-replacer pairs we validated, the strength of the observed phenotype scaled with the strength of sequence similarity between the replacer gene and its match in the promiscuous gene tree (i.e., Panels 12 of Fig 1). Namely, metB fully restored growth in metC cells, while the less homologous cysM and hisA (in that order) less efficiently supported growth following target knockout (see S1 Text; also compare alignments in S4, S5 and S6 Figs). Thus, these examples suggest that higher similarity to the function-assigning gene corresponds to higher activity or affinity for that enzymes substrates, although a more extensive study of multicopy suppression phenotypes would be needed to uphold this observation generally.  Indirect replacer predictions and follow-up mutagenesis experiments reveal thiG as having pyridoxal 5-phosphate synthase activity Among the 98 indirect target-replacer pairs we predicted, two were for the target pdxB, which is by far the most ubiquitiously replaced target found in vitro across published multicopy sup- pression datasets (in fact, pdxB is the sole focus of the Kim study: [8]). We confirmed our in sil- ico predictions of these two target-replacer pairs using the manually curated E. coli model iAF1260 [22]. The target, pdxB, is a conditionally essential gene (essential on M9 medium, but not on rich medium) involved in the biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (P5P), the active form of Vitamin B6. Vitamin biosynthesis reactions are good candidates for multicopy sup- pression, since vitamins are required in low amounts, so even a moderate flux through an over- expressed promiscuous enzyme could provide enough of the nutrient to enable growth [24]. P5P is an essential cofactor in all known living systems [25].  We tested our two predicted pdxB target-replacer pairs, and found one of them, thiG replac- ing pdxB, to be a true replacer [pdxB/thiG colonies were 1mm diameter, vs. 0.10.2mm diam- eter in pdxB/empty, after 3 days incubation in replicate experiments on M9 medium; see S2 Table]. The observed phenotype was consistent with previously reported pdxB replacers (1mm colonies of a pdxB/replacer strain after 12 days (3 cases) or 35 days (4 cases) at 37C in equivalent growth conditions & temperature [8]). We explored the thiG-pdxB target-replacer pair in detail, as follows:  (1) Pathway and sequence similarity analysis to identify promiscuous function of  thiG. Among the 7 multicopy suppressors (i.e., replacers) previously reported in Kim et. al. for pdxB [8], all were inferred to rescue growth of pdxB by contributing downstream interme- diates to the pyridoxal 5-phosphate synthesis pathway, thus bypassing pdxB (see Fig 2A). In contrast, the predicted multicopy suppression activity of thiG that we confirmed experimen- tally suggests that ThiG promiscuously assumes the PdxS function Pyridoxal 5-phosphate synthase (glutamine hydrolyzing) (hereafter referred to as: P5PS), a reaction that has been described in Bacillus subtilis and other organisms and that completely bypasses the 6-step Pyri- doxal 5-phosphate synthesis pathway known in E. coli (see Fig 2A) [25, 26].  Our prediction of thiG supporting Vitamin B6 biosynthesis is based on similarities between a portion of thiG and a portion of pdxS from Staphylococcus haemolyticus, as found in our gene similarity trees. pdxS in Staphylococcus haemolyticus was annotated as such based on high simi- larity (81% identity over 98% of the genes) with the well-studied pdxS gene in B. subtilis (e.g., see [25] and [27]). A BLASTP gene alignment of B. subtilis pdxS versus E. coli thiG confirms that the genes share a region of moderate similarity, which contains conserved residues of pdxS [25] (see S7A Fig).   Fig 2. Proposed novel pathway for promiscuous production of pyridoxal 5-phosphate. GEM-PROPER was used to predict the indirect target-replacer pair, pdxB/thiG, which we then confirmed with experiments. The predicted secondary function of thiG is pyridoxal 5-phosphate synthase (P5PS), which would bypass the known 6-enzymatic-step pathway for production of p5p in E. coli. (a) The two alternative pathways, along with known promiscuous pathways in E. coli for producing p5p after pdxB knockout (as reported in Kim: [8]). Abbreviations are: ru5p-D = D-Ribulose 5-phosphate; gln-L = L-glutamine; g3p = Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; glu-L = L-glutamate; Pi = Phosphate. (b) Structural alignment of a homology model of thiG (for E. coli, based on crystal structure of thiG from B. subtilis) with a crystal structure of B. subtilis pdxS, the gene that (in complex with another gene, pdxT) performs the P5PS function in B. subtilis. The proteins share the TIM barrel fold. (c) Close-up of the structural alignment in (b), focused on the active site of pdxS and the residues of thiG that we propose perform the pdxS function. The location of the close-up is shown with a box in (b).   PdxS has been shown to dimerize with PdxT to form a complex that catalyzes the P5PS reaction, with PdxS and PdxT acting as synthase and glutamine amido transferase, respec- tively. In E. coli, glutamine amidotransferases exist that have some sequence similarity to pdxT (e.g., the gene guaA, GMP synthetase, which BLASTP reveals to have 29% sequence identity with pdxT over 77% of the pdxT gene). Notably, our list of indirect replacers for pdxB also included hisH, with the predicted function of pdxT. Thus, hisH is a strong candidate for func- tionally complimenting the potential pdxS function of thiG. However, pdxS is also present in the genomes of certain organisms in the absence of pdxT, and it has been hypothesized that it might operate in these organism as an ammonium-dependent synthase of P5P, thus bypassing the need for the glutamine amidotransferase subunit pdxT [26]. It is therefore plausible that the low affinity replacer function of thiG produces P5P either with or without an amidotrans- ferase (using glutamine, ammonium, or some other substrate), and that this is the mechanism by which increased ThiG restores growth in pdxB cells.  (2) 3-D structural alignment to determine putative thiG promiscuous active site for  P5PS activity. We performed a 3-D alignment of ThiG and PdxS protein structures (E. coli ThiG homology-model structure was built using the crystal structure from B. subtilis as tem- plate; PdxS structure was taken from B. subtilis; see methods). This structural superimposition revealed that E. coli ThiG and B. subtilis PdxS share the same fold [TIM barrel: ()8], and revealed a potential overlap of ThiG residues with the PdxS active site: Lys-95, Asn-204, and Glu-97 from the E. coli ThiG homology-model lie within 1.4, 2.2, and 4.9 angstroms respec- tively from the catalytic residues Lys-81, Asp-24, and Asp-102 in PdxS (distances were deter- mined between alpha-carbons of the carboxylic/amide groups in the active sites of the Asn, Glu, and Asp, or between Nitrogens in the active group in the case of Lyssee Fig 2B and 2C). These distances are well within the error of homology models [28], and we thus hypothesize the above-mentioned amino acids can perform the PdxS function. Multiple views of this align- ment are shown in Figs 2B and 2C and S8. One of the residues in ThiG that we propose to be active in its promiscuous PdxS-like function (Glu-97) is one of the two natural ThiG dyad active site residues used during thiamine biosynthesis (see S7B Fig), but the other two proposed residues are not [29]. Thus, the proposed PdxS activity of ThiG is not solely a repurposing of the original active residues. We found that all three proposed residues are more evolutionarily conserved than neighbor residues, suggesting a functional role (ConSurf calculations with default parameters and max homology threshold of 70%; see S9 Fig) [30].  (3) Inactivation of putative thiG promiscuous active site to test if that removes pdxB  replacement activity. To validate the putative secondary triad active site of ThiG (i.e., the res- idues Lys-95, Asn-204, and Glu-97), we tested whether inactivation of the predicted active site would eliminate the ability of ThiG to replace PdxB in vitro. We therefore constructed an over- expression plasmid containing a mutated copy of thiG in which we performed alanine substitu- tion of Lys-95 and Glu-97 (L95A, E97A). The third residue of the proposed active site, Asn- 204, was not altered since, as noted, this residue comprises part of the primary ThiG dyad active site. We thus created a mutated form of thiG (thiGmut) with the proposed secondary active site disturbed, but the site for the primary activity of thiG unaffected.  To investigate the effect of thiGmut overexpression on the growth of pdxB cells in minimal media, we transformed pdxB cells with plasmids encoding IPTG-inducible copies of thiGmut (pdxB/thiGmut), thiG (pdxB/thiG), pdxB (pdxB/pdxB rescue plasmid positive control), as well as the empty vector (pdxB/empty negative control). To determine the optimal M9 glucose media conditions for growth comparison, we performed a checkerboard dilution assay in deep-well microplates in which we individually assessed the growth of each strain across a matrix of varied IPTG and ammonium nitrate (NH4Cl) concentrations to identify synergistic combinations of inducer and nitrogen source, respectively. The nitrogen source (NH4Cl) was varied because we observed that vitamin B6 is used heavily as a cofactor in enzymes that partic- ipate in amino acid metabolism (S10 Fig), so we hypothesized that altered levels of nitrogen consumption might have some effect on the demand for p5p, and thus might influence the sig- nal to noise ratio in validation experiments for ThiG secondary activity.    Fig 3. Inactivating the thiG proposed secondary active site removes its ability to replace pdxB. Four strains (pdxB/empty [- control], pdxB/pdxB [+ control], pdxB/thiG, pdxB/thiGmut) were grown for 96 hours in deep-well microplates, in which a checkerboard matrix of varied IPTG (inducer) and NH4Cl (nitrogen source) concentration in M9 glucose were assessed. Values shown are representative OD600 readings at 96 hours post-inoculation. Additional OD600 data are provided in S5 Table. Box plots of OD600 values at 3% NH4Cl (across IPTG concentrations) are shown in lower panel, along with the results of Ranksum tests of OD600 values between relevant strain pairs.    Strikingly, we found that IPTG and NH4Cl combinations that supported the most robust growth of our pdxB/pdxB control were also supportive of pdxB/thiG at 48 and 96 hours post-inoculation (Figs 3A and S11, S5 Table). Conversely, we observed that pdxB/thiGmut and pdxB/empty similarly exhibited poor growth across all media conditions. Ranksum tests of optical densities (OD600) for all strains grown at the experimentally observed optimum NH4Cl concentration (3%), across all IPTG concentrations, revealed highly significant differ- ences between growth of the pdxB/pdxB and pdxB/thiG group versus the pdxB/thiGmut and pdxB/empty group after 96 hours (p< = 4.7e-3), but no significant differences within these groups. Importantly, these findings were consistent with subsequent batch culture growth experiments performed using the optimized concentrations of 10 M IPTG and 3% NH4Cl in M9 glucose (S11 Fig). These data strongly indicate that inactivation of our proposed secondary active site in thiG negatively impacts the ability of thiGmut to promiscuously replace pdxB in vitro.    Discussion Identifying promiscuous gene functions is a fundamental task in biology. Promiscuous func- tions have been causally associated with the evolution of new gene functions [24, 31], and may have contributed to the evolution of resistance to antimicrobials and other stresses [7]. Here, we present a new method termed PROPER that uses iterative PSI-BLAST-based phylogenetic trees for predicting potential promiscuous functions based on weaker similarities than are typi- cally considered in assigning gene functions. Based on these predictions, we experimentally val- idate 4 novel target-replacer pairs, one of which (thiG replacing pdxB), was found by coupling our promiscuity predictor with a GEM. Finally, we predict and then experimentally validate the promiscuous active site of thiG for this replacing activity, revealing a striking new promis- cuous route for the production of an essential nutrient, p5p, in E. coli.  While sequence similarity-based methods (e.g., BLAST) are used ubiquitously to determine primary gene functions, their ability to call promiscuous functions is unclear. Our method gives a first estimate, as we were able to experimentally validate around 20% of direct target- replacer pairs we could test in the lab (This is 100x higher than expected if guessing target- replacer pairs randomly). It is likely that the number of target-replacer pairs we validated is an underestimate of true promiscuity, as some true replacers might not show during multicopy suppression due to incorrect expression levels (e.g., due to non-optimal IPTG concentrations), insufficient effects of target knockout, or other confounding factors. Notably, many of our pre- dictions might be correct even though they cannot be directly validated through multicopy suppression (due to the necessity in multicopy suppression that the target gene is conditionally essential). Our comparison to the work of [17] emphasizes this point, as several of our pre- dicted target-replacer pairings came up in that work, regardless of the fact that the target genes examined in that study are not conditionally essential. The promiscuous functions we predict thus might represent a large underground repertoire that could be activated under the right kinds of selective pressure.  Our method for predicting promiscuous gene functions utilizes the RAST database and automatically constructed metabolic models from SEED, resources that include thousands of bacterial and archaeal species. While manually curated GEMS for E. coli are available (e.g., [32]), we chose to use the SEED GEM because it interfaces smoothly with the SEED and RAST databases, which was necessary for implementing GEM-PROPER without needing to reconcile thousands of metabolite and reaction names with an outside model. A second benefit of this choice is that although we focus here on predicting promiscuous gene functions in E. coli, our methods are generic and may easily be extended to any other organism in RAST. This could, for example, aid in determining resistance or adaptation mechanisms across major pathogenic strains, which could then be targeted in new cures.  In all, this work constitutes the first ever genome-wide prediction of metabolic gene multi- copy suppression, and the first integration of such predictions with a GEM to achieve network- reliant indirect predictions. We begin with an unsupervised, large-scale method to predict enzyme promiscuity, and finally dial in on and then experimentally verifying a key prediction of biological significance in E. coli. Without such a systems approach, it would have been extremely difficult to identify thiG as a candidate replacer for pdxB. Thus, this study serves as a successful example where systems biology can provide a roadmap for biological investigation, identifying the most promising targets to then follow up on with more costly and time-con- suming experiments.   Materials and Methods Implementation of PROPER PROPER proceeds in three steps, as outlined in Fig 1: (1) building gene similarity trees for all genes in E. coli; (2) using these trees to build a matrix of promiscuous gene functions; and (3) applying this matrix to determine potential promiscuous gene replacers for target genes of interest. In GEM-PROPER, step (3) is replaced by a GEM-based approach, in which we search for promiscuous functions (from step 2) that can rescue in silico growth of a GEM model after knockout of the target gene. Here, we describe these steps in detail:  Step 1: Building the enzyme promiscuity trees. To identify as many promiscuous gene  functions as possible, we performed an unsupervised iterative PSI-BLAST based search for dis- tant sequence relationships between genes in E. coli and all other genes in the SEED database. Our method involved five steps: (1) align the current query sequences; (2) cluster the aligned sequences to reduce sampling bias in sequencing; (3) trim aligned representatives to eliminate non-conserved ends; (4) use trimmed alignments in a PSI-BLAST search against the non- redundant protein database in SEED; and finally, (5) keep PSI-BLAST hits that match certain criteria, as outlined below. These hits would be kept for the next round of PSI-BLAST, and the process would continue for three rounds with increasingly more relaxed thresholds for keeping PSI-BLAST hits.  The intuition behind this approach was to use iterative trimming to build a compact protein profile that is effective at recruiting distant homologs. These profiles differ from individual pro- tein domains such as some CDDs in that they capture the conserved arrangement of multiple domains in related protein sequences. The parameters used in this protocol were manually tuned to facilitate inspection of related protein functions in the same tree for expert annotators at SEED. The detailed protocol and parameters are provided in the supplementary materials (S1 Text). For the last PSI-BLAST search, a combination of the following cutoff criteria was used:  1. uncovered region of the query sequence < = 100  2. the query sequence is at least 60% covered  3. sequence percent identity > = 0.15  4. sequence percent positive match > = 0.30 [This is the percentage of aligned bases with posi-  tive scores from the substitution scoring matrix indicating conserved changes (identical pairs included)].  As PSI-blast itself can do iterative search, the main difference in our approach was trimming and clustering. By trimming we eliminated non-conserved ends, so the profile is more compact and more effective at recruiting distant homologs during each search. The clustering step keeps only the representative sequences in the profile, thus alleviating some of the sampling bias, i.e., so that the profile is not dominated by E. coli variants of the protein. We use MAFFT [33] for alignment and FastTree [34] for tree building.  This whole procedure provided a tree for each gene in E. coli that links to other genes with any sequence similarity, which were then candidates for assigning potential (predicted) pro- miscuous functions to the root gene.  Step 2: Building a matrix of promiscuous gene functions. Genes in RAST are annotated with functions, which then (in the case of metabolic genes) link to metabolic reactions. After a few attempts to set distance thresholds in the trees for assigning functions, we found that including all function in the tree as a potential promiscuous function gave optimal results.    Therefore, all functions existing in the tree of a root E. coli gene are considered potential pro- miscuous functions, as are their metabolic reactions. In cases where a gene is promiscuously associated with only one subunit of an enzyme complex, we predicted that entire function is associated with the root gene. We entered these gene-function promiscuous pairings into a matrix for further analysis.  Step 3 in PROPER: Determining direct target-replacer pairs. To search for direct tar- get-replacer pairs, we identified cases in our matrix in which any of a replacer genes promis- cuously assigned functions is the same as the primary annotated function of a target gene of interest.  Step 3 in GEM-PROPER: Determining indirect target-replacer pairs. To search for indirect target-replacer pairs, we identified cases in our matrix in which any of a replacer genes promiscuously assigned functions can metabolically bypass the primary annotated func- tion of a target gene of interest. This analysis could only be done for target genes that are con- ditionally essential in silico, i.e., whose knockout causes in silico death on M9 medium but not on rich medium.  The GEM used was a genome-scale metabolic model for Escherichia coli K12 taxon ID  83333.1 as downloaded from SEED [21]. Target genes for which Patrick had found replacers were assessed for M9 medium conditional essentiality in silico, and the subset of Patrick targets that were also conditionally essential in silico were kept for further analysis. All essentiality tests were done using Flux Balance Analysis testing for a nominal production of biomass [35]. Metabolic reactions associated with functions in our enzyme promiscuity matrix were added to the GEM individually after knockout of each of the targets to assess if in silico growth was res- cued. Cases in which the indirect replacer gene (i.e., the one associated with the rescuing reac- tion) rescued in silico growth were considered predictions of indirect replacement.  Experimental validation of promiscuity predictions via multicopy suppression Multicopy suppression is an established assay that has been described elsewhere (see panel 4 in Fig 1, and, e.g., [8, 19]). In our experiments, we tested specific target-replacer pairs in the man- ner used by Kim to validate target-replacer pairs they identified in their large-scale screen. Namely, we inserted a plasmid containing the replacer gene with an IPTG-induced promoter into a KEIO strain with the target gene knocked out, and assessed whether this target-replacer strain grew better than the target knockout strain without the replacer. Specifics of strain con- struction and the experiments follow:  Bacterial target, target-replacer, and control strain construction E. coli strains containing specific gene knockouts were obtained from the KEIO collection [36], which contains single-gene knockout strains for the majority of genes in E. coli. Plasmids for IPTG-inducible expression of predicted replacer genes were obtained from the ASKA collec- tion [37], which contains plasmids that overexpress nearly every individual gene in E. coli. Both collections are obtainable from the National Bioresource Project at the National Institute of Genetics, Japan. KO target strains were made electro-competent (4x washes with ddw/10% glycerol) and transformed with ASKA plasmids over-expressing the corresponding predicted replacer gene.  When we were developing our assay, we found that knockout colonies usually grew after some amount of time on M9 medium regardless of whether the replacer gene had been added to the plasmid, despite the fact that each of the target strains we tested was previously reported to be non-viable on M9 medium. The previous study by Patrick [19] had not plated background target-deleted strains that had empty plasmids inserted. Due to the eventual growth in most strains, this was an important negative control for judging that a replacer was actually compensating for the loss of the target and improving growth (and was done in Kim: [8]). Therefore, for each KO strain we additionally transformed with an empty ASKA plasmid as a negative control. We judged a strain to be a true replacer only if it came up consistently stronger and/or earlier than the strain carrying the empty plasmid.  Verification of target identity (knockout location) and plasmid insertion In the KEIO collection each knocked out gene is replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene (KanR). Thus we verified correct location of the knockout in each target strain by amplifying and sequencing the area directly flanking the kanamycin insertion, using a kanamycin univer- sal primer and a strain-specific reverse primer located downstream of the knocked out gene. Since the orientation of the kanamycin insertion depends on the orientation of the original knocked out gene, the KanR primer 5-ATATTGCTGAAGAGCTTGG was used when the original gene had been forward coded and the KanR primer 5-AATGAACTCCAGGACGAG was used if the original gene had been reverse coded. Correct sequence of the replacer gene was verified by amplifying and sequencing the ASKA plasmid insert (forward: 5-ATC ACC ATC ACC ATA CGG AT; reverse: 5-CTG AGG TCA TTA CTG GAT CTA).     Target-replacer plating experiments Starter cultures of each target-replacer (TR) pair were grown overnight in LB+CAP, washed and serially diluted in saline (0.9% NaCl). Aliquots (100 ul) of 106 dilution were plated on LB+chloramphenicol and on M9-glucose-kanamycin-chloramphenicol (1 M9 salts, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1mMCaCl, 0.4% glucose, 34 g/mL chloramphenicol, 30g/ml kanamycin) contain- ing IPTG. All TR pairs were plated on both M9 with 50M and 125M IPTG; TR pairs of par- ticular interest (hisA/hisH, cysM/ilvA and thiG/pdxB) were plated on 250M as well. In each TR plating experiment, the empty and frvX negative controls were plated alongside the TR pairs. Plates were wrapped in nylon to avoid dehydration, incubated at 37 and monitored during the next three weeks. Nearly all negative control plates showed some growth phenotype, ranging from very strong (normal sized colonies within 3 days) to very weak (pinpoint colonies after 3 weeks; S3 Table). Thus, a TR pair was considered valid only if colonies consistently formed at a higher rate than in both negative control plates. Each plating experiment was repeated 23 times.  Growth in liquid M9 Growth of TR pairs that showed exceptionally high growth on the negative control plates (glyA, ptsI and pabB) was also monitored in liquid culture. Cultures in LB+CAP were washed once in saline and re-suspended at a dilution of 1:100 into M9-glucose-kanamycin- chloramphenicol minimal media supplemented with IPTG (50 M). Growth measurements were performed in a 96-well plate incubated for 1924 h at 37C in a temperature-controlled plate reader with continuous shaking (ELX808IU-PC; Biotek), and OD595 was monitored every 15 min. Each TR pair was loaded into 2 duplicate wells. Growth of the negative controls (empty and frvX plasmids) for each target strain was likewise monitored during every run.  Verifying non-heterogeneity of pdxB It was reported in [8] that knockout strains of pdxB sometimes display a heterogeneous pheno- type, with some growing on minimal medium and others not. To be sure that this was not a factor in our experiments verifying the thiG/pdxB replacer-target pair, we grew individual col- onies of pdxB and confirmed that there was no heterogeneity in their growth on M9 medium.  Microwell plate experiment and batch culture for thiG replacement of pdxB Overnight cultures of each strain were grown in LB with 30 g/mL kanamycin (pdxB cells) and 25 g/mL chloramphenicol (ASKA plasmids) selection. Cells were washed in 1x PBS and diluted 1:100 into M9-glucose-kanamycin-chloramphenicol for plate seeding; M9 was pre- pared without a nitrogen source. A checkerboard matrix was generated in 2mL deep-well, 96-well assay plates by serial dilution of NH4Cl (22.5% w/v maximum concentration) across plate columns and IPTG (500 M maximum concentration) across plate rows. Wells were uni- formly inoculated with cells, and each well contained a final volume of 1.2 mL. Plates were sealed with gas-permeable membranes and grown in a light-protected, microplate incubator shaker at 37C and 700 RPM; 700 RPM was determined to be equivalent to 300 RPM in a stan- dard incubator shaker. Samples for OD600 measurements were taken at designated timepoints using a SpectraMax M5 microplate multimode plate reader (Molecular Devices), and the gas permeable membrane resealed after each timepoint. 100 L samples were taken for OD600 mea- surements to minimize the total volume loss.  For batch culture experiments, cells were prepared from overnight cultures as described  above. Cells were diluted 1:100 in 30 mL of M9-glucose-kanamycin-chloramphenicol, contain- ing 3% NH4Cl (w/v) and 10 M IPTG, in 250 Erlenmeyer flasks. Cultures were grown at 37C and 300 RPM in an incubator shaker, with samples for OD600 measurements taken at desig- nated timepoints.  Structural alignment of pdxS and thiG The X-ray structure of pdxS (from B. bacillus) in complex with pdxT, was downloaded from the pdb database, and the residues of the pdxS active site were identified from the publication (active residues are: K149, D102, K81 and D24) [38]. Multiple pdxS units from the multimeric structure were overlaid and were found to be coincident (as can be seen in Figs 2B and S8). No structure of thiG was available from E. coli, so a homology-model was built using the SWISS- MODEL pipeline (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/; [39]) based on the thiG template from Ther- mus thermophilus (51.98% seq identity; PDB ID 2htm [40]). The structures of pdxS were subsequently aligned with that of thiG using pyMol [41].  Effects of IPTG on replacers in multicopy suppression assays Low (50M) IPTG concentration was sufficient to induce all of the replacers. Interestingly, increasing the IPTG concentration affected growth sometimes positively and sometimes nega- tively, depending on the specific strain. Increasing IPTG concentration up to 250M caused increases in colony size and number, and decreases in incubation times, for hisA/hisH and cysM/ilvA. Conversely, growth of purE/purK, one of the target-replacer pairs predicted by both Patrick and us, was almost entirely inhibited when IPTG concentration was increased to 125uM. These results illustrate that over-expression can also have deleterious effects [42]. The optimal level of expression (and hence the optimal IPTG concentration) depended on the spe- cific target-replacer combination. In agreement with this, in several target strains, over-expres- sion of the randomly chosen gene frvX caused a decrease of the background seen in the empty plasmid control (see S3 Table).

All target-replacer pairs predicted by our method were assessed for how often a metabolic target paired with a metabolic replacer, with a non-metabolic replacer, a non-metabolic target with a metabolic replacer, etc. We found that (A) Replacer genes with metabolic primary functions take more metabolic targets than do replacer genes with non-metabolic primary functions; (B) Replacer genes with non-metabolic primary functions take more non-metabolic targets than do replacer genes with metabolic primary functions; and (C) The number of targets replaced by replacer genes with non-metabolic vs. metabolic primary functions is the same.

Histograms are shown of: (A) number of genes rep- resented in each tree; (B) number of unique organisms represented in each tree; (C) number of distinct functions represented in each tree; and (D) number of E. coli metabolic functions pres- ent in each tree.

(A) E. coli thiG is aligned with pdxS, the gene whose func- tion it putatively performs promiscuously. Key residues in both genes are marked, as per the key at the bottom. Two alignments are shown as they came up in BLASTP sequence alignment. (B) The active residues of thiG for its primary function are shown, along with putative active residues for the pdxS function. (TIF)  S8 Fig. Structural alignments of thiG and pdxS. Multiple alignments are shown. (TIF)  S9 Fig. Evolutionary conservation of the putative pdxS residues in thiG. The residues in thiG that we predict can perform the pdxS function show a high degree of conservation, as shown in the plot. This was generated from the output of ConSurf, set with default settings except for a maximum cutoff of 70% homology in the sequences to be aligned (higher cutoffs led to less resolution in distinguishing how conserved the key residues are versus their neigh- bors).

Results analogous to those shown in Fig 5 of the main text are shown, but at the 48 hour timepoint (instead of 96 hours as shown in the main text). (A) Rank- sum test across all IPTG concentrations in the microwell plate experiment (equivalent of that shown in Fig 6, but for the 48 hour timepoint instead of 96 hours). (B) Results of a separate batch culture experiment, with 58 replicates per group, which show the same trend of the microwell plates from subfigure A. P-values are from t-tests across replicates of each strain grown in identical condition (4% NH4Cl and 10uM IPTG with otherwise minimal M9 media). #OD600 values in (A) were measured using 100uL of culture, where 300uL of culture would be the equivalent of a normal 1mL cuvette.

In   this research,   ten  enzymes   were   investigated   for   the   promiscuous   activity   in   catalysis   of  the   Michael addition-cyclization   cascade   reaction   of   p-nitrobenzalacetone   with   1,3-cyclohexanedione   to   prepare   2- hydroxy-2-methyl-4-(4-nitrophenyl)-3,4,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-chromen-5(6H)-one  in  anhydrous   media, and  control   experiments   were   conducted   to  exclude   false   positive   results.   The   highest   yield   (46.1%) was   observed   with   Escherichia   coli  BioH   esterase   and   the   optimal   reaction   condition   was:   1   mmol ,-unsaturated   ketone,   1  mmol   1,3-dicarbonyl   compound,   20   mg   E.  coli   BioH   esterase,   20   ml  N,N- dimethylformamide   at   37 C   for   120   h.   To   preliminarily   investigate   the  mechanism,   site-directed mutagenesis   was   performed   on  the   hydrolysis   catalytic   triad   of  BioH,   and   the   results   indicated   alternate- site   enzyme   promiscuity.   When   a  series   of  substituted   benzalacetones   and   1,3-cyclic   diketones   were used   as   the   reactants,   yields   of   up   to   76.3%   were   achieved.   These   results   imply   the   potential   industrial application   of  E.  coli   BioH   in  the  preparation   of   dihydropyran   derivatives.     2014   Elsevier   Ltd.  All   rights   reserved.  1.  Introduction   Dihydropyran  derivatives  have  attracted  signicant  atten- tion  due  to  their  diverse  biological  activities  [1].  Generally, 3,4-dihydropyran  derivatives  are  prepared  by  inverse-electron- demand  hetero-DielsAlder  reactions  of ,-unsaturated  carbonyl compounds  with  electron-rich  alkenes.  In  2008,  Franke et  al.  used  pyrrolidine  derivatives  as  catalysts  to  prepare  3,4- dihydropyrans  [3].  After  that,  Yu  et  al.  designed  and  utilized  a  uo- rinated  diarylprolinol  silyl  ether  to  catalyze  the  reaction  between 1,3-dicarbonyl  compounds  and   ,-unsaturated  aldehydes  [4]. Then,  Liu  et  al.  applied  chiral  diamine  catalysts  to  synthesize 3,4-dihydropyran  derivatives  using  cyclic  dimedone  and ,- unsaturated  ketones  as  reactants  [5].  Recently,  Ray  and  coworkers reported  a  facile  method  to  synthesize  3,4-dihydronpyrans  through chiral  pybox-diph-Zn(II)  complex  catalyzed  Michael  addition  of cyclic  1,3-dicarbonyls  to  2-enoylpyridine  N-oxides  [6].  Despite  the great  progresses  made  in  the  employment  of  organocatalysts,  many reported  methods  for  the  synthesis  of  3,4-dihydropyran  derivatives suffer  from  drawbacks  such  as  high  cost,  harsh  reaction  conditions, toxicity  and  laborious  workup  procedure.  Therefore,  the  devel- opment  of  a  new  method  with  a  simpler  and  more  convenient procedure  using  a  cost-effective,  eco-friendly  catalyst  is  still  in demand.  Owing  to  the  potential  application  of  enzyme  catalytic  promis- cuity  in  organic  synthesis,  considerable  effort  has  been  made  over the  past  decade  [7].  For  instance,  enzymes  have  been  used  to catalyze  Aldol  reaction  [8],  BaylisHillman  reaction  [9],  Mannich reaction  [10],  Michael  addition  [11]  and  Knoevenagel  reaction  [12]. This  kind  of  catalytic  promiscuity  largely  expands  the  application scope  of  enzymes  in  organic  synthesis.  In  continuation  of  our  work  on  enzyme  catalytic  promiscu- ity  [13],  herein  we  describe  another  example  of  the  catalytic promiscuity  of  Escherichia  coli  BioH  esterase  and  its  application in  the  synthesis  of  3,4-dihydropyran  derivatives  via  the  Michael ,-unsaturated  ketones addition-cyclization  cascade  reaction  of  and  1,3-dicarbonyl  compounds  (Fig.  1).  The  reaction  reported  here employed  the  economical  and  eco-friendly  E.  coli  BioH  esterase  as the  catalyst  and  successfully  provided  access  to  a  diverse  range  of 3,4-dihydropyran  derivatives.  This  protocol  provides  an  interest- ing  insight  into  enzyme  catalytic  promiscuity  and  may   have  the potential  for  industrial  application.  Fig.  1.  E.  coli  BioH  esterase-catalyzed  synthesis  of  3,4-dihydropyran  derivatives  via  the  Michael  addition-cyclization  cascade  reaction  between  substituted  benzalacetones and   1,3-cyclic  diketones.  2.  Materials  and  methods  2.1.  Materials  Amano  lipase  AK,  Amano  lipase  AS,  Amano  lipase  AYS  and Amano  lipase  DF  were  purchased  from  Amano  Enzyme  Inc.  Lipase from  Candida  rugosa  was  purchased  from  SigmaAldrich.  Lipozyme RMIM  and  lipozyme  TLIM  were  purchased  from  Beijing  Gaoruisen Technology  Co.  Ltd.  Lipase  from  Rhizomucor  miehei,   esterase  from Rhodobacter  sphaeroides  (RspE)  were  expressed  in  E.  coli  [14,15]. Bovine  serum  albumin  (BSA)  was  purchased  from  Aladdin  Chem- icals.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  all  reagents  were  obtained  from commercial  suppliers  and  used  without  further  purication.   2.2.  Construction  of  mutants  by  site-directed  mutagenesis  pET-30a  plasmid  harboring  the  recombinant  BioH  gene  (E.  coli K12)  was  used  as  a  template  for  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)- based  site  directed  mutagenesis  using  the  QuikChangeTM method (Stratagene,  La  Jolla,  CA).  The  synthetic  primers  used  to  construct the  mutants  are  listed  in  Table  S1  in  Supplementary  materials.  The mutations  were  conrmed  by  DNA  sequencing.  2.3.  Protein  expression  and  purication  The  resulting  recombinant  cells  were  grown  in  500  ml   LB  media containing  50 g/ml  kanamycine  at  37 C.  The  culture  was  allowed to  reach  an  OD600 of  0.40.6  before  induced  with  0.5  ml   isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  (0.1  mM)   for  4  h  at  37 C.  The  cells were  then  harvested  by  centrifugation  (2150 g,  10  min,  4 C),  and washed  twice  with  100  ml   phosphate-buffered  saline  (0.1  M,   pH 7.4).  Then  the  cells  were  resuspended  in  50  ml  TrisHCl  buffer (50  mM,   pH  8.0)  and  disrupted  by  sonication.  The  supernatants were  puried  on  a  Nickel  column  as  reported  [16].  The  purity  of enzyme  was  checked  by  SDS-PAGE  (Supplementary  materials,  Fig. S1).   2.4.  Typical  enzymatic  procedure  for  the  formation  of 3,4-dihydropyran  derivatives  A  mixture  of  the  1,3-dicarbonyl  compound  (1  mmol), ,- unsaturated  ketone  (1  mmol),  pure  enzyme  powder  of  E.  coli  BioH esterase  (20  mg)   in  DMF   (20  ml)   was  shaken  at  200  rpm,  37 C for  specied  time.  The  reaction  progress  was  monitored  by  thin layer  chromatography  (TLC).  After  the  reaction  was  completed,  the enzyme  was  ltered  off  (Whatman qualitative  medium  ow  lter m)   and  the  ltrate  was paper,  15  cm,   ash  washed  with  water  (20  ml)   and  extracted  with  dichloromethane (2   20  ml).  The  organic  phase  was  combined,  dried  with  MgSO4 and  concentrated  under  reduced  pressure.  The  crude  residue  was puried  by  ash  column  chromatography  (200300  mesh  silica  gel) with  an  eluent  consisting  of  petroleum  ether/ethyl  acetate  (2:1, v/v).  Product-containing  fractions  were  pooled,  concentrated  and dried.  All  the  compounds  were  spectroscopically  characterized  (1H NMR  and 13C  NMR).  2.5.  Analytical  methods  Analytical  thin  layer  chromatography  (TLC)  was  performed on  Haiyang  precoated  TLC  plates  (silica  gel  GF254),  eluted  with petroleum  ether/ethyl  acetate  (1/1,  v/v). 1H  NMR   (400  MHz)  and 13C  NMR   (100  MHz)  spectra  were  recorded  on  a  Bruker  Advance 2B  400  instrument.  Chemical  shifts  ()  were  quoted  in  ppm  using CDCl3 (1H  NMR   7.26, 13C  NMR   77.16)  or  DMSO-d6 (1H  NMR    2.5, 13C  NMR   39.52)  as  solvent  and  tetramethylsilane  (TMS)  as an  internal  reference.  The  coupling  constants  (J)  were  quoted  in Hz.  The  structures  of  the  products  were  conrmed  by  comparing the 1H  NMR   and 13C  NMR   spectral  data  with  those  reported  in  the literature  [5].   3.  Results  and  discussion   The reaction of p-nitrobenzalacetone 1a and 1,3- cyclohexanedione  2a  was   chosen  as  a  model  reaction  (Fig.  2). A  wide  range  of  enzymes  were  rapidly  screened  for  catalytic activity in  this  Michael  addition-cyclization  cascade  reaction (Table  1).  When  the  reactants  were  incubated  without  any  protein or  with  a  non-catalytic  protein  such  as  bovine  serum  albumin (BSA),  no  product  was   formed  even  after  120  h  (entries  12, Table  1).  Amano  Lipase  Ak,  Amano  Lipase  AS,  Amano  Lipase AYS  and  Amano  Lipase  DF  all  showed  very  low  activity  toward this  cascade  reaction  (entries  36,  Table  1).  Lipase  from  R.  miehei, Lipozyme  TLIM  from  Thermomyces  lanuginosus,  Lipozyme  RMIM from  R.  miehei  and  lipase  from  C.  rugosa  also  showed  low  catalytic activities  in  this  reaction,  giving  product  yields  of  only  2.6%,  3.7%, 4.5%  and  3.4%,  respectively  (entries  710,  Table  1).  When  the  R. sphaeroides  esterase  (RspE)  was  applied,  the  reaction  proceeded slowly  and  the  target  compound  was   obtained  in  a  yield  of 8.7%  (entry  11,  Table  1).  E.  coli  BioH  esterase,  which  contains   classical  Ser-His-Asp  catalytic  triad  and  belongs  to  the  group of  carboxylesterases  [16],  was   identied  as  the  most  effective biocatalyst  for  this  cascade  reaction  and  the  target  compound  was obtained  in  a  yield  of  46.1%  (entry  12,  Table  1).  In  the  past  few years,  some  studies  found  that  the  previously  reported  enzyme promiscuous  activity  was   actually  not  catalyzed  by  the  enzymes [17,18].  As  a  control  experiment,  the  reactants  were  incubated with  the  urea-denatured  E.  coli  BioH  esterase,  where  no  conversion was  observed  (entry  13,  Table  1),  conrming  that  the  catalysis  was indeed  mediated  by  the  bioactive  enzyme.  However,  it  remains unknown  whether  the  hydrolysis  site  in  E.  coli  BioH  esterase  is also  responsible  for  its  promiscuous  activity,  as  believed  for  other hydrolases  [19].  In  order  to  clarify  this  question,  site-directed mutagenesis  studies  were  performed  on  the  Ser-His-Asp  cat- alytic  triad.  The  two  mutants  BioH  esterase  Ser82Ala  and  BioH esterase  His235Ala  showed  catalytic  activities  similar  to  that of  the  wide-type  (entries  1415,  Table  1),  indicating  an  active site  other  than  this  catalytic  triad.  In  2007,  Reetz  and  co-workers proposed  a  viewpoint  called  alternate-site  enzyme  promiscuity, suggesting  that  the  reaction  catalyzed  by  promiscuous  enzyme neither  involves  any  of  the  catalytic  amino  acids  of  the  natural enzymatic  process,  nor  appears  to  occur  in  the  natural  binding pocket  [20].  To  some  extent,  our  study  conrms  this  view.  These results  implied  that  perhaps  the  tertiary  structure  and  the  special spatial  conformation  rather  than  the  hydrolysis  site  of  the  BioH esterase  are  responsible  for  this  cascade  reaction.  Other  reaction conditions  such  as  enzyme  loading  and  temperature  were  also investigated.  The  results  showed  that  yields  of  up  to  46.1%  were achieved  when  20  mg   of  pure  enzyme  powder  of  BioH  esterase were  used  in  20  ml   of  DMF   at  37 C  for  120  h.  Encouraged  by  our initial  study  results,  some  more ,- unsaturated  ketones  and  1,3-dicarbonyl  compounds  were  tested in  order  to  investigate  the  generality  and  the  substrate  spectrum of  this  E.  coli  BioH-catalyzed  Michael  addition-cyclization  cas- cade  reaction  (Table  2).  It  was  noted  that  the  reaction  activity  of 1,3-cyclohexanedione  was  higher  than  that  of  5,5-dimethyl-1,3- cyclohexanedione  (entries  13  versus  entries  57,  Table  2).  This was  probably  due  to  the  steric  hinderance  of  methyl.  In  the  case of ,-unsaturated  ketones,  the  electronic  properties  and  sub- stituent  position  at  the  aromatic  ring  played  an  important  role in  the  product  yields.  For  example, ,-unsaturated  ketones  with electron-withdrawing  groups  could  enhance  the  reactivity  of  the substrate  (entries  58,  entries  1112,  Table  2),  and  the  substituent in  the  4-position  of  benzalacetone  led  to  a  higher  yield  than  the same  substituent  in  the  2-  or  3-position  (entry  1  versus  entries 23,  entry  5  versus  entries  67,  entry  8  versus  entry  12,  Table  2). This  might  be  due  to  the  stablilization  of  electron-withdrawing groups  on  the  phenyl  ring  of  the  benzalacetones  by  the  amino  acid residues  of  the  E.  coli  BioH  via  hydrogen  bond,  which  was   in  favor of  nucleophilic  attack  by  carbanion.   4.  Conclusions  In  conclusion,  we   have  developed  a  novel  E.  coli  BioH  esterase- catalyzed  method  to  synthesize  3,4-dihydropyran  derivatives  with moderate  to  high  yields  via  the  Michael  addition-cyclization  cas- cade  reaction.  The  two  mutants  BioH  esterase  Ser82Ala  and  BioH esterase  His235Ala  showed  a  catalytic  activity  similar  to  that  of  the wide-type,  conrming  the  view  proposed  by  Reetz  and  co-workers called  alternate-site  enzyme  promiscuity.  In  addition,  because this  enzyme  could  be  prepared  by  large  scale  fermentation  of  E.  coli with  a  low  cost,  this  protocol  could  provide  an  economic  route  to preparation  of  dihydropyran  derivatives  and  might  be  potentially useful  for  industrialization.  Further  studies  on  improving  the  activ- ity  and  enantioselectivity  of  this  enzyme  by  both  directed  evolution and  rational  design  are  in  progress.  Fig.  2.

Himes, Scott E. Allen, Sungwon Hwang, and Albert A. Bowers* Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States  * S Supporting Information  ABSTRACT: Sactipeptides are peptide-derived natural prod- ucts that are processed by remarkable, radical-mediated cysteine sulfur to -carbon coupling reactions. The resulting sactionine thioether linkages give rise to the unique dened structures and concomitant biological activities of sactipep- tides. An E. coli heterologous expression system, based on the biosynthesis of one such sactipeptide, subtilosin A, is described and this expression system is exploited to probe the promiscuity of the subtilosin A sactionine bond-forming enzyme, AlbA. These eorts allowed the facile expression and isolation of a small library of mutant sactipeptides based on the subtilosin A precursor peptide, demonstrating broad substrate promiscuity where none was previously known. Importantly, we show that the positions of the sactionine linkages can be moved, giving rise to new, unnatural sactipeptide structures. E. coli heterologous expression also allowed incorporation of unnatural amino acids into sactipeptides by means of amber-suppression technology, potentially opening up new chemistry and new applications for unnatural sactipeptides.    S actipeptides are an emerging class of peptide-derived  natural products. The hallmarks of compounds in the class are intramolecular thioether bridges between cysteine sulfurs and the unreactive -carbons of bridging partner amino acids (Figure 1a). To date, ve sactipeptides have been isolated and structurally characterized, including subtilosin A, the sporulation killing factor (Skf), thurincin H, and the two- component sactipeptide thuricin CD (Figure 1b).18 Unlike the -thioether bridges in the analogous lantipeptides, these sactionine linkages are quaternary due to the bridging partner side chain. Additionally, sactipeptide rings tend to be coaxal with the peptide backbone constrained in a U-like formation. The overall distribution of sactipeptide bridges combines with the stereochemistry of the ,-disubstituted residues in the bridging partner residues to give sactipeptides regions of dened secondary structure, as in the 310-helical N-terminus of subtilosin A or the -helical faces of thuricin CD (Figure 1c). The often amphipathic helicity of regions of the peptides is thought to grant subtilosin A and its congeners the ability to interact with and disrupt bacterial cell walls resulting in often bactericidal, typically narrow spectrum, activity.4,9,10 Still, the precise mechanisms of action of many sactipeptides are not yet fully understood.  In terms of biosynthesis, sactipeptides are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modied peptide natural products (RiPPs).11 As such, they are produced from gene- encoded precursor peptides, which are post-translationally modied to install the distinctive sactionine linkages. Recently, Marahiel and co-workers characterized the key enzymes responsible for installing thioethers in subtilosin A, Skf, and thurincin H, in particular, the radical SAM enzymes, AlbA, SkfB, and ThnB, respectively.1214 These so-called sactionine synthetases are members of the newly dened SPASM-domain (Subtilosin A/PQQ/Anaerobic Sulfates Maturing) -containing family of enzymes and are predicted to have two [4Fe-4S] clusters, one each for activating the sulfhydryl and for coupling partner carbon center in what amounts to a radicalradical heterocoupling during cyclization (Figure 1a).15 Large gaps still exist in our understanding of the mechanism and promiscuity of the sactionine synthetases and the eect that changes in structure may have on their potential therapeutic properties. In particular, how the sactionine synthetases select multiple dierent bridging partner residues specically at each bridge site and to what extent that can be manipulated or modied are still looming questions.  A homologous expression system has been reported for thurincin H, using a plasmid encoded copy of the precursor peptide in a precursor-knockout background of the native thuringiensis SF361.16 Additionally, mutants of producer, B. subtilosin A, genetically encoded on a pDG-148 plasmid and coexpressed with the native substrate, have been isolated in the native producer B. subtilis 168.13 While both of these approaches allowed some mutational sampling, the promiscuity of the respective radical SAM enzymes (rSAM) could be obscured by multiple factors: (1) poor downstream processing by other pathway enzymes potentially also contributing to (2) inecient export by the dedicated natural product transporters in the clusters, (3) decreased transcriptional amplication by the known feedback regulation mechanisms or (4) rapid proteolytic degradation of partially modied peptides by the potent intracellular protease activity inherent to many strains of Bacilli.  We anticipated that development of a heterologous system for in vivo overexpression of modied sactipeptides would facilitate future investigations of their biosynthesis, as well as allow for rapid, large-scale production of modied variants.1723 We sought a system that would allow robust overexpression of precursor peptides to allow isolation of sucient materials for downstream characterization and/or potential application. We therefore set out to develop a system to allow heterologous expression of processed sactipeptides in E. coli under the control of the strong T7 promoter and purication from cell pellets. E. coli expression would further allow the adaptation of mature amber stop-codon suppression technology, as has been employed to varying extents with other RiPPs.20,2428 We chose to focus these eorts rst on the sactipeptide subtilosin A, its precursor peptide SboA, and radical SAM enzyme AlbA (Figure 1d). Subtilosin A contains three sactionine thioether bridges and therefore provides a number of opportunities to examine the interdependency of the dierent bridge formation sites.   HETEROLOGOUS PRODUCTION OF PRESUBTILOSIN A  In order to facilitate purication of heterologously expressed sactipeptides, we rst tested enzyme compatibility with N- terminal or C-terminal hexahistidine tags. The subtilosin A precursor gene sboA was separately cloned into pMCSG7 (N- terminal-His tag) and pET28c (C-terminal-His tag) and expressed and puried from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Full- length peptides were puried from inclusion bodies using His- trap Ni-NTA columns according to the procedure of Li et al.29 In parallel, N-terminal-His6-tagged radical SAM AlbA was expressed, puried, and reconstituted as described by Fluhe et al. Upon incubation of peptides and enzyme, we could conrm complete formation of all three sactionine bridges by LC/MS and MS/MS. Therefore, AlbA appears indierent to N- or C- terminal extensions. In the present application, this result suggested that tandem heterologous expression of AlbA and a His-tagged SboA could feasibly yield mature sactipeptides. We chose to move forward with the N-terminal tag as we anticipated that the fortuitous placement of several lysine residues in SboA would allow facile removal of the tag together with the leader peptide via trypsin digestion.    Precursor and enzyme were subsequently cloned into multiple cloning sites 1 (MCS1) and 2 (MCS2), respectively, of the pETDuet-1 vector to generate the bicistronic construct (Figure 2a). Unlike the native producer, this expression system would not be capable of producing true head-to-tail cyclized product because we did not include any candidate protease capable of forming this last linkage. It has been shown that this lack of head-to-tail cyclization does not aect the activity of the sactionine synthetase AlbA, and head-to-tail cyclization is not present in a number of other sactipeptides, such as Thurincin H and Thuricin CD.13 A variety of conditions were tested to aect sactionine formation in vivo (Figure 2b). Ultimately, we found that coexpression in the presence of pPH151 containing the E. coli suf ABCDSE genes and dropping the shake rate signicantly improved expression of the modied sactipep- tide.30,31 These two measures facilitate proper AlbA expression and activity: rst by proper assembly and repair of the FeS cluster, assisted by suf ABCDSE, and second by limiting aeration and possible quenching of the enzyme. SDS-PAGE gels of the crude lysates showed substantially improved expression of AlbA under the optimized conditions (see Supporting Information). The high copy duet vector pRSFDuet-1 was also tested but showed negligible improve- ment over our pETDuet construct. We therefore employed the pETDuet-SboA-AlbA construct in our further examination of AlbA sactionine substrate promiscuity.   DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF SBOA MUTANTS  With a functional heterologous system in hand, we next sought to examine the ability of AlbA to accept alternate SboA substrates in vivo. To date, sactipeptide mutants have largely been limited to alanine scans or relatively conservative mutations at bridging partner residues. Preliminary eorts by Marahiel and co-workers suggested that AlbA has somewhat strict substrate requirements, standing in contrast to the vast majority of RiPP enzymes characterized to date. We therefore designed our initial mutants with three primary goals in mind: (1) to test the promiscuity for bridging partner residues and to examine requirements for (2) substrate exibility or pre- organization and (3) cysteine spacing relative to the brief leader sequence. Saturation mutagenesis would require a library size too large to allow specic probing of each of these areas; we instead pursued a rational design approach. In the case of the three bridging positions, Cys4S-Phe31C, Cys7S-Thr28C, and Cys13S-Phe22C (Figure 1c), we incorporated a small subset of sterically and electronically distinct amino acids that are observed at bridging partner positions in other known sactipeptides, Ala, Gln, Met, Phe, Ser, and Thr (Table 1, entries 114). A second set of mutants targeted alanine scanning at exible glycine residues adjacent to the sactionine bridging partners (Glys 26, 29, and 32), as well as potential turn- inducing prolines at residues 18 and 20. The latter two were also targeted for direct deletion in order to more extensively probe eects of the residues 1421 loop on nucleating bridge formation. Finally, we moved the cysteine residues themselves around the N-terminal side of SboA. In order to minimize the number of potential changes to be tested, we chose to move cysteines by swapping them with residues at the respective position. The analogous Ala-swap could also be considered for further investigation.  In total, we designed and examined 40 mutants. Several of these mutants were accessed by QuikChange mutagenesis; however, the majority could be readily obtained by gene synthesis at equivalent or lesser cost (see Supporting Information). In each case, the mutant gene was incorporated into MCS1 of the pETDuet vector containing AlbA in MCS2 and expressed in the pPH151 background under the same optimized conditions as the wild-type SboA using small (100 mL culture size) grow-ups. Peptides were induced with IPTG, as with the wild type, and isolated in a medium throughput manner by using small spin Ni-NTA columns. To facilitate characterization, peptides were further trypsinized to remove the His-tag plus a portion of the leader peptide (cleaves at Lys, 6, Figure 1b).  The distinctive MS/MS fragmentation pattern of sactionine linkages (Figure 3a) was used to evaluate cross-bridge partnering of cysteines in the mutants.4,32 The thioamidals in sactionine bridges have been shown to undergo facile retro- elimination and tautomerization to the corresponding dehy- dramino acid at low collision voltages as depicted in Figure 3ad; the new amide is much more labile than a typical peptide bond, owing to the resonance-stabilized enamine leaving group. Thus, at low collision voltages, only the cleavage of these bonds is observed; other amide bonds stay intact, allowing the determination of the bridge location. This MS-generated formal dehydrogenation at bridging partners has previously been reported by Vederas et al., who exploited it to correctly assign connectivity in the structure of sactipeptide thuricin CD. The alternative desulfurization method, employing nickel-borodeu- teride, worked in our hands but often gave variable and incomplete results, even with subtilosin A itself.7,8 This was potentially due to metal contaminants carried over from Ni- NTA purication or other catalyst posions from the heterologous system. In the MS/MS method, sactionine linkages were easily the most labile at lower collision energies, and these provided strong qualitative conrmation of bridging partner residues with low parts-per-million error. In all cases, the presence of less than three bridges could be readily conrmed by reductive treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and LC/MS to show masses of relevant adducts. Although sactionine linkages can be formed with diering stereochemistry at the bridge partner -carbon, we did not examine eects of mutants on stereochemistry in this study. Outside of NMR, there are no good methods to measure sactionine stereochemistry that we could nd reported in the literature to date.    We compared production of our modied peptides to native production of subtilosin A in B subtilis 168. B. subtilis is reported to produce subtilosin A at roughly 5.5 mg/L6. We obtained between 1 and 2 mg/L dry weight or 2040% of native production from the Duet system (see SI, Figure S29). Production levels of mutants are highly variable, and many of them could only be detected very faintly by UV/vis. Based on extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of the products, yields of mutants varied from 10% to greater than 300% when compared to EIC of the modied wild type peptide (see SI, Figures S30 S59 and Table S2). In general, many of the cysteine swap mutants were produced at comparable or higher levels than the wild type SboA peptide in the Duet system (see SI, Table S2). In several instances (12 out of 40), we observed no product from induction of a given mutant.    The variable or complete lack of production may happen for a number reasons, such as intrinsic destabilization of the given mutant peptide or its transcript causing degradation or unanticipated metabolic processing, such as glutathionylation or other detoxifying post-translational modication that might cause the product to escape our isolation procedure. We expect that post-translation installation of sactionine linkages would improve peptide stability. Therefore, in the analysis, instances of no product were interpreted as a weak proclivity of the enzyme to accept those substrates. Still, it should be noted that these are the results of expression under the current in vivo conditions. It also seems reasonable to speculate that while expression of some mutants may be lower than wild-type, even the production of these low levels has been buoyed by the presence of strong overexpression of the sactionine synthetase relative to levels in the native producer.    SUBSTRATE TOLERANCE AT BRIDGING PARTNERS  Several dierent amino acids appear at bridging partner residues in sactipeptides. Even within subtilosin A itself, phenylalanine and threonine appear at dierent positions, suggesting that the sactionine synthetases might have some level of tolerance for dierent bridging partners. A set of alanine mutants at the three bridging partners of subtilosin A was tested in our E. coli expression system (Table 1, entries 1, 5, and 10). In all three mutants, all three bridges were formed and MS/MS conrmed that the site of modication remained the same; that is, cross-linking occurred at the new Ala22, Ala28, or Ala31 residue. Marahiel and co-workers had reported a lack of production of F22A, T28A, and F31A bridging partner mutants expressed in parallel with the native cluster in B. subtilis. In our hands, however, in an E. coli heterologous expression system, these three mutants were well tolerated by the AlbA enzymatic machinery, demonstrating a potential benet of this approach. Beyond alanine, only the +28 position appeared particularly permissive to other amino acid residue substitutions. Thr28 could also be substituted with serine, phenylalanine, and asparagine and still be activated and incorporated into a sactionine bridge. Meanwhile, Phe22 could be substituted with methionine and still be processed to a sactionine linkage, but neither serine nor threonine substitutions at this position yielded peptide. Similarly, the F31S was processed to a three- bridge product, but no product could be observed with threonine, methionine, or asparagine substitutions at this position.  Given the promiscuity at the +28 residue, we wondered if there could be any proclivity for the native amino acid. We therefore exchanged Thr28 with the upstream Ala27 to see if this would drive bridge formation toward the newly positioned threonine. This was not the case, however, the sactionine bridge was instead formed at Ala28, suggesting minimal residue level control over steering modications, at least at this position.    SUBSTRATE TOLERANCE AT UNMODIFIED POSITIONS  The precursor peptides for subtilosin and the two components of thuricin CD, Trn- and Trn-, all exhibit relatively high glycine content (22%, 26%, and 22% of noncysteine residues respectively). We therefore sought to probe whether substrate exibility arising from these residues was necessary to allow enzymatic modication or if -branching might drive a choice of alternative bridging partners. An alanine scan of the three C- terminal glycine residues, Gly26, Gly29, and Gly32, demon- strated that these positions can tolerate at least small, sterically unhindered amino acid side chains at these positions (Table 1, entries 1521). Moreover, all three positions could be substituted with alanines at once, with no detriment to product formation. All products isolated from these grow-ups exhibited three complete sactionine bridges with the native residues (Phe22, Thr28, and Phe31), suggesting that AlbA is indierent to secondary structure or exibility at these glycine residues.  Subtilosin A has the largest loop of the known sactipeptides (eight amino acids compared to seven in thuricin CD and four in thurincin H), and none of the other known sactipeptides have prolines in their loop regions. We therefore sought to determine whether Pro18 and/or Pro20 were necessary for inducing a turn and allowing AlbA to thereby work on the sets of bridging residues (Table 1, entries 2527). Again, alanine scans at these two positions demonstrated that AlbA was indierent to the presence of prolines at these positions, at least with respect to the number and regioselectivity of sactionine bridge formation. However, complete deletion of Pro18 did appear to shift the bridging partner of Cys13 for the rst time in our experiments (entry 22). Careful scrutiny of the MS/MS data indicates that the Cys13 sactionine thioether is formed at the  carbon of the new Pro19 in isolates from this mutant; the locations of the other two sactionine bridges are conserved. In contrast, deletion of Pro20 sustains formation of the now Phe21 linkage; again, locations of the Cys4 and Cys7 thioether bridges are conserved as well (entry 23). Overall, these mutants demonstrate substrate promiscuity on the part of AlbA and suggest that substrateenzyme interactions may play a role in dictating the position of bridge formation. Alterations to the loop proline residues could also conceivably be expected to have an impact on stereochemistry, especially at the nearby Cys13Phe21 sactionine linkage, a question for future investigations.   SUBSTRATE TOLERANCE FOR CYSTEINE PLACEMENT  Subtilosin A seemingly has relaxed specicity for the bridging partner residues and is able to accept Ala, Gln, Met, Phe, Ser, and Thr to varying degrees at the three dierent positions. Therefore, two major questions can be posed with respect to cysteine placement: (1) can cysteines be moved and still form bridges, and (2) will the bridging partner change depending on the placement of the cysteine? We examined these questions with a series of 14 cysteine swap mutants: four swap mutants each at Cys4 and Cys7, ve mutants at Cys13, and a tandem mutant. Under our heterologous conditions, bridges at Cys4 and Cys7 seemed resistant to changes in placement (Table 1, entries 2836). Cys4 did tolerate a move one residue toward the leader peptide (entry 30), but this move came at the expense of the remaining two bridges, which went unformed in this product. Similarly, Cys7 could be swapped with Ser8 or Gly10, while still allowing formation of the Cys4 bridge, but neither the newly placed middle bridge nor the anterior bridge were formed.  In stark contrast to the Cys4 and Cys7 bridges, Cys13 proved remarkably tractable. Of the ve positional swaps tested (entries 3640), only the Cys11/Ala13 swap (entry 37) did not yield a fully modied three-bridge product. Each new placement of Cys13, either at the +10, + 12, + 14, or +15 positions, resulted in a sactionine linkage to the same bridging partner as the original linkage (Phe22). Interestingly, the Gly10 position, which did not allow a swap with Cys7, is capable of tolerating a sactionine bridge when a +7 bridge is also formed in the nal product (entry 36).  The relative success of the mutants tested may betray the order of AlbA-catalyzed bridge formation in this heterologous host. While the system does not appear to tolerate movement of Cys4 and Cys7, the third bridge at Cys13 seems to tolerate a wide array of changes. This could be due to the rst two bridges being formed rapidly, allowing the rest of the peptide to reach a sort of conformational equilibrium before formation of the third bridge; further kinetic analysis of the bridge-forming reaction will be necessary to conrm this. The formation of a bridge to F22 regardless of the position of the third cysteine indicates a degree of enzymatic control over regioselectivity. This control is overridden in the case of the deletion of Pro18, which suggests that this residue is crucial in spacing and in the conformation of the loop.   INCORPORATION OF UNNATURAL AMINO ACIDS  Unnatural amino acids (UAAs) have been incorporated in a number of heterologously expressed RiPP natural products by amber codon suppression technology, including lantipeptides and cyanobactins.20,2428 In the case of the lantipeptides, UAAs allowed access to analogs with improved potency and solubility. We anticipate that similar eects can be obtained with UAA incorporation into bioactive sactipeptides. UAA incorporation may also allow access to new chemistry from sactionine- forming radical SAM enzymes: since the enzyme putatively generates a reactive radical intermediate, specic placement of a radical trap or other reactive group on a bridge partner amino acid side chain could allow side-tracking into alternative reaction manifolds. This would only be possible if the radical SAMs prove permissive for UAAs at the bridging partner residue. We thus tested UAA incorporation via the orthogonal O-methyl tyrosine tRNA synthetase/tRNA (O-Me-Tyr) pair adapted from M. janaschii.  pUltra-OMe-Tyr plasmid, replicated by an orthogonal pCDF origin of replication and bearing streptomycin resistance, was incorporated in BL21(DE3)s on top of pPH151 and a pETDuet-sboA-AlbA vector mutated to an amber stop codon (TAG) at F31. While we could observe unmodied peptide production/UAA incorporation at 200 rpm, this was accom- panied by substantial amounts of truncate arising from disrupted translation at the newly incorporated TAG codon. No modied sactipeptide could be found at the lower, 50 rpm shake rate. We therefore turned to the recently reported TAGless E. coli strain, C321.A.exp, developed by Isaacs et al.33 In order to drive expression of our same pETDuet-sboA- AlbA, the DE3 prophage was integrated into C321.A.exp. Subsequent growth under our optimized conditions yielded cyclic presubtilosin A exhibiting fully modied cysteine thioether bridges at all three native positions (Figure 4). MS/ MS conrmed the C4S(OMeTyr)C linkage at the newly installed UAA.   CONCLUSIONS  In summary, we have developed a system for the heterologous expression of sactipeptide derivatives of subtilosin A in E. coli and demonstrated unexpected biosynthetic promiscuity of the sactionine synthetase AlbA. We anticipate that a similar strategy could be used to access other predicted sactipeptides or else chemistry from the ever-widening library of radical SAM enzymes in RiPP pathways.3436 The pronounced promiscuity, especially in the loop region and at unmodied positions on the solvent-exposed exterior of the peptide macrocycle, could be exploited for the grafting of peptide epitopes as has been seen in lasso peptides and conotoxins. Moreover, we observed for the rst time promiscuity with respect to sactionine bridge placement and, in specic instances, bridging partner selection. An expanded understanding of control over sactionine bridge placement could allow for the design of constrained sactipeptide conformations for inhibitory display of peptide epitopes; our E. coli expression system should facilitate such eorts. Results with sactionine bridge movements suggest these three interdependence between the positioning of bridges; this may further be compounded by the overall exibility of the substrate. Therefore, many more modied sactipeptides may be possible from compound mutants that combine multiple mutations. Again, this is another place where the heterologous expression system may prove benecial: based on the changes reported here, including the demonstrated mobility of the bridge partners, we estimate libraries far in excess of 1012 non-native subtilosin A analogs to be possible. Thus, this work enters the sactipeptides as another example of a secondary metabolic system capable of producing vast libraries with signicantly high structural complexity. Finally, we have introduced nonproteinogenic amino acids (UAAs) into sactipeptides using stop-codon suppression technology, specif- ically at otherwise less permissive bridging partner position. This demonstrates the robustness of UAA incorporation in our system and may open up new chemistry and new applications for unnatural sactipeptides.

The active sites of KGPDC and HPS share several conserved residues, including the presumed ligands for the Mg2+ and a catalytic histidine residue that has been implicated in protonation of the intermediate in the KGPDC- catalyzed reaction. As reported in the previous manuscript, both enzymes are naturally promiscuous, with KGPDC from Escherichia coli catalyzing a low level of the HPS reaction and the HPS from Methylomonas aminofaciens catalyzing a significant level of the KGPDC reaction. Interestingly, the promiscuous HPS reaction catalyzed by KGPDC can be significantly enhanced by replacing no more than four active site residues from KGPDC reaction with residues from HPS. In this manuscript, we report structural studies of wild-type and mutant KDGPCs that provide a structural explanation for both the natural promiscuity for the HPS reaction and the enhanced HPS activity and diminished KGPDC activity catalyzed by active site mutants.

KGPDC catalyzes the formation of L-xylulose 5-phosphate and carbon dioxide from 3-keto- L-gulonate 6-phosphate in the anaerobic pathway for L-ascor- bate utilization in some eubacteria; HPS catalyzes the for- mation of D-arabino-hex-3-ulose 6-phosphate from D-ribulose 5-phosphate and formaldehyde in microorganisms that can assimilate formaldehyde as a carbon source (Scheme 1) (2-8). In contrast to the reaction catalyzed by OMPDC, both KGPDC and HPS catalyze reactions that involve the Mg2+-assisted formation and stabilization of 1,2-enediolate intermediates.  Earlier structural studies established that, like OMPDC, KGPDC assembles as a dimer of ((cid:226)/R)8-barrels (Figure 1) (1). In both enzymes, two equivalent active sites are located at the dimer interface. Although a structural explanation for the impressive catalytic proficiency has not yet been gener- ally accepted, OMPDC evidently uses a hydrogen bonded network of active site residues to avoid the formation of a highly unstable vinyl anion intermediate (5, 9, 10). The catalytically important residues are an aspartate at the end of the first (cid:226)-strand, a lysine at the end of the second (cid:226)-strand, and an Asp-x-Lys-x-x-Asp motif at the end of the third (cid:226)-strand, with the first aspartate and lysine from one poly- peptide and the second aspartate from the adjacent subunit in each active site. The lysine apparently acts as the general acid that delivers a proton to C6 to form the product (4, 5). In KGPDC, the lysine at the end of the second (cid:226)-strand is replaced by a glutamate (Glu 33), and the essential Mg2+ is liganded by this glutamate and Asp 62 of the Asp 62-x-Lys 64-x-x-Asp 67 motif at the end of the third (cid:226)-strand (11). A key difference between the mechanisms of KGPDC and OMPDC is the identity of the catalytic acid. Lys 64, the general acid in OMPDC, does not perform a similar function in KGPDC. Instead a His 136 and Arg 139 competitively transfer protons to a 1,2-cis-enediolate intermediate via inter- vening water molecules (12, 13).  Scheme 1: The Reactions Catalyzed by KGPDC, HPS, and OMPDC along with Proposed Reaction Intermediates or Transition States  Although no structure is currently available for an HPS, it is likely that its active site will resemble that of KGPDC because of the sequence similarity between the two enzymes. In particular, the groups at the ends of the first, second, and third (cid:226)-strands are conserved, thereby providing the ligands for the Mg2+ ion that is essential for both reactions. Although the histidine at the end of the sixth (cid:226)-strand is conserved, the glutamate at the end of the fifth (cid:226)-strand is replaced with an aspartate, suggesting the presence of a His-Asp dyad in HPS instead of a His-Glu dyad. No arginine is located at the end of the sixth (cid:226)-strand. Because the aldol condensation is both expected to require enolization of the D-ribulose 5-phosphate substrate and reported to be stereospecific for the formation of the arabino-configured product, it is ex- pected that the His-Asp dyad is the required general base in the HPS-catalyzed reaction. The reason for this sequence change from KGPDC is unclear.   FIGURE 1: The structures of the (A) KGPDC with bound L-gulonate 6-phosphate and (B) OMPDC with bound UMP. Both enzymes adopt similar ((cid:226)/R)8-barrel folds and adopt similar tertiary structures.    As reported in the previous manuscript, KGPDC catalyzes a low level of the HPS reaction and HPS catalyzes a sig- nificant level of the KGPDC reaction, thereby providing com- plementary functional promiscuity in the OMPDC suprafam- ily (14). Presumably, both active sites use the coordinated Mg2+ to stabilize 1,2-enediolate intermediates, although these are generated differently in the two enzymes: decarboxy- lation of 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate by KGPDC and general base-catalyzed enolization of D-ribulose 5-phosphate in HPS. The previous manuscript also reported that the promiscuous HPS reaction catalyzed by KGPDC is stereo- specific and yields the same D-arabino-hex-3-ulose 6-phos- phate product produced by the natural HPS. In contrast, the promiscuous KGPDC reaction catalyzed by HPS is ste- reospecific with respect to protonation of the 1,2-enediolate intermediate, with the stereochemical course consistent with the His-Asp dyad providing the proton incorporated into the L-xylulose product.  Interestingly, the promiscuous HPS activity catalyzed by KGPDC could be significantly enhanced by replacing only a few residues conserved among KGPDCs with conserved residues found in HPSs (14). In particular, Glu 112 at the end of the fifth (cid:226)-strand was replaced with an aspartate, Arg 139 at the end of the sixth (cid:226)-strand was replaced with a valine, Thr 169 at the end of the seventh (cid:226)-strand was replaced with an alanine, and Arg 192 at the end of the eighth (cid:226)-strand was replaced with an alanine. Although the E112D, R139V, and T196A substitutions individually enhanced the promiscuous reaction e5-fold and the R192A substitution decreased the promiscuous reaction by g100-fold, multiple substitutions were synergistic, with the value of the kcat for the promiscuous reaction increased 170-fold by the E112D/ R139V/T169A/R192A mutant, and the value of kcat/Km increased 260-fold by the E112D/R139V/T169A mutant. For both of these multiple mutants, the values of the kinetic constants for the natural KGPDC activity were decreased.

In this manuscript, structural studies are reported that provide important insights into the observed changes in both the natural KGPDC and the promiscuous HPS reaction. The X-ray crystal structure of KGPDC with the D-ribulose 5-phosphate substrate for the HPS reaction to 2.0  resolu- tion has been determined in order to understand better the nature of the catalytic promiscuity for the HPS reaction. The structures of two designed KGPDC mutants, E112D/T169A and E112D/T169A/R139V, are also described with the HPS substrate bound to 1.6 and 1.8  resolution, respectively. Finally, the structure of the E112D/T169A/R139V triple mutant with the L-xylulose 5-phosphate product of the KGPDC reaction has been determined. The designed sub- stitutions were observed to have small but significant effects on the conformations of the ligands as well as in the placement of His 136 relative to the bound ligands, thereby allowing the observed changes in the values of the kinetic constants reported in the previous paper to be rationalized.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Construction of KGPDC Mutants. Site-directed mutants of KGPDC were introduced into the UlaD gene, which encodes KGPDC, using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The DNA sequences of each mutant were verified, and the protein was expressed in the BLR(DE3) recA- strain of Escherichia coli, and purified as previously described for wild-type KGPDC (6).  Protein Purification and Crystallization. KGPDC was expressed and purified as described previously (6). The protein was dialyzed against 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, concentrated to 15 mg/mL, frozen as small pellets in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 (cid:176) C. Crystals of KGPDC were grown by microbatch by combining 10 (cid:237)L of protein solution and 10 (cid:237)L of a solution containing 16% MePEG 5000, 100 mM bis-tris-propane pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, and 25 mM L-xylulose 5-phosphate or 25 mM D-ribulose 5-phosphate as described before (1, 15). All three of the KGPDC mutants crystallized in the space group C2 with two KGPDC molecules in the asymmetric unit. Cell dimensions for each complex after freezing are given in Table 1.  Crystal Freezing and Data Collection. Crystals of all four KGPDC complexes were transferred in two steps for approximately 30 s to a cryoprotecting solution containing 15% MePEG 5000, 100 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 15% ethylene glycol, 200 mM NaCl, and 50 mM L-threonohydroxamate 4-phosphate or 50 mM D-ribulose 5-phosphate. The crystals were flash frozen in a cold nitrogen stream at -160 (cid:176) C prior to data collection. Data for wild-type KGPDC, the E112D/ T169A KGPDC double mutant, and the E112D/R139V/ T169A KGPDC triple mutant with bound D-ribulose 5-phos- phate were collected to 2.0, 1.6, and 1.8  resolution, respectively. Data for the E112D/R139V/T169A triple mutant with bound L-xylulose 5-phosphate were collected to 1.7  resolution. All diffraction data were collected at beamline 19ID of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL (APS), utilizing a single 180(cid:176) scan with 1(cid:176) oscillations for a duration of 5 s per frame. The data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (16). Data collection statistics are given in Table 1  Structure Determination and Refinement. The structure of each KGPDC mutant was solved by molecular replacement with the program Molrep using the previously determined structure of KGPDC(cid:226)L-gulonate 6-phosphate as a search model (1, 17, 18). Each model was improved by refinement with the program Refmac (17, 19, 20). Solvent atoms were added to each model using the program ARP/wARP (21). Final values for the R-factor and R-free for each structure are listed in Table 2. Analysis with the program PROCHECK indicated that 93.9% of residues were found in the most favorable regions and 6.1% in the additionally allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot for the KGPDC(cid:226)D-ribulose 5-phosphate structure (22). For the E112D/T169A(cid:226)D-ribulose 5-phosphate structure, 93.5% of the residues fall in the most favorable regions with the remaining 6.3% and 0.3% falling in the additionally allowed and generously allowed regions. For the E112D/R139V/T169A(cid:226)D-ribulose 5-phosphate struc- ture, 94.8% of the residues fall in the most favorable regions with the remaining 5.2% falling in the additionally allowed regions. For the E112D/R139V/T169A(cid:226)L-xylulose 5-phos- phate structure, 94.8% of the residues fall in the most favorable regions with the remaining 5.2% falling in the additionally allowed regions.

To understand better how KGPDC catalyzes the promiscuous aldol condensation of D-ribulose 5-phosphate and formal- dehyde, the crystal structure of wild-type KGPDC was deter- mined with D-ribulose 5-phosphate bound in the active site. As in previously determined structures of KGPDC, the enzyme assembles as a dimer of ((cid:226)/R)8-barrels that are related by a 2-fold rotational axis that results in the formation of two active sites at the dimer interface (13). The position of D-ribulose 5-phosphate in the active site is similar to that observed for the L-xylulose 5-phosphate product of the KGPDC reaction. Like the structure of KGPDC with L-xylulose 5-phosphate, O1 of the D-ribulose 5-phosphate substrate was not visible in the electron density. As in the other liganded structures of KGPDC, a Mg2+ ion was coordinated to O2 and O3 of D-ribulose 5-phosphate as well as the side chains of Glu 33 and Asp 62. The side chain of His 136, which has been implicated in protonation of the enediolate intermediate in the KGPDC-catalyzed reaction, was located near C1 of the D-ribulose 5-phosphate. From the electron density, the change in configuration at car- bon C4 that distinguishes D-ribulose 5-phosphate and L-xylulose 5-phosphate could clearly be seen (Figure 2A). Somewhat surprisingly, as in the structure with L-xylulose 5-phosphate, O4 of D-ribulose 5-phosphate forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Thr 169 despite the change in configuration at this carbon (Figure 2B). As a result, D-ribulose 5-phosphate adopts a conformation distinct from that of bound L-xylulose 5-phosphate through subtle con- formational changes.  The manner in which D-ribulose 5-phosphate binds in the active site of KGPDC is expected to allow the KGPDC- catalyzed HPS reaction to proceed via a 1,2-cis-enediolate intermediate similar to that established for the KGPDC reaction. In the natural KGPDC reaction, electrostatic interactions between the Mg2+ ion and the negatively charged O2 of the 1,2-enediolate intermediate stabilize the intermedi- ate (13). Identical interactions between O2 of D-ribulose 5-phosphate and the Mg2+ ion should serve a similar function in the promiscuous HPS reaction and allow KGPDC to stabilize the enediolate formed from D-ribulose 5-phosphate. In addition, the side chains of Lys 64 and Asp 67, both of which stabilize the enediolate in the natural KGPDC reaction, are found in identical positions in the presence of D-ribulose 5-phosphate and likely serve a similar function in the promiscuous HPS reaction.  In the KGPDC reaction, His 136 has been demonstrated to function as a proton source to transfer a proton, via an intermediary water molecule, to C1 of the 1,2-enediolate intermediate to generate L-xylulose 5-phosphate (13). The position of the His 136 side chain is virtually unchanged in the presence of D-ribulose 5-phosphate compared to L- xylulose 5-phosphate, so it is expected to participate as the general base in enolization of D-ribulose 5-phosphate in the HPS reaction. In support of this hypothesis, the H136A mutant of KGPDC is unable to catalyze proton exchange of the C1 proton of either L-xylulose 5-phosphate or D-ribulose 5-phosphate and is also unable to catalyze the HPS reaction (14).  A solvent-exposed area located on the opposite face of the C1-C2 bond of the bound D-ribulose 5-phosphate provides sufficient room for formaldehyde to approach the 1,2-enediolate and undergo the aldol condensation. Such a mechanism is consistent with the observed stereochemistry for the KGPDC-catalyzed HPS reaction in which the 1-proS proton of D-ribulose 5-phosphate is abstracted and formal- dehyde adds to the re-face of C1 of the 1,2-enediolate intermediate.  Structural Bases for the Enhanced HPS ActiVity of the E112D/T169A Mutant. To better understand why the E112D/ T169A mutant of KGPDC catalyzes the promiscuous HPS reaction better than either single mutant, the crystal structure of the mutant was determined with D-ribulose 5-phosphate bound. These two mutations have the effect of making KGPDC more HPS-like: E112D is expected to gen- erate a His 136-Asp 112 dyad, and T169A is expected to remove the hydrogen bonding interaction with O4 of the bound substrate. These substitutions produce a 60-fold increase in the value of kcat for the promiscuous HPS reaction (14). Both substitutions could clearly be discerned in the electron density map. The shorter Asp 112 side chain could be differentiated from the longer glutamate side chain in the structure of wild-type KGPDC, and the T169A substitution was unambiguous (Figure 3A). The electron density for D-ribulose 5-phosphate was clear, and the configurational change at C4 compared to L-xylulose 5-phosphate was obvious.  In the structures of wild-type KGPDC with either L- xylulose 5-phosphate or D-ribulose 5-phosphate bound, the side chain of Thr 169 was observed to form a hydrogen bond with O4 of the substrate. This interaction caused D-ribulose 5-phosphate to shift slightly in the active site compared to the position of L-xylulose 5-phosphate due to the difference in configuration about C4 (Figure 3A). The change of Thr 169 to an alanine allows the conformation of D-ribulose 5-phosphate to relax to a conformation more like that of L-xylulose 5-phosphate, which likely allows the 1,2-ene- diolate intermediate to be stabilized in a more productive conformation.  The significance of the Glu 112 to aspartate substitution is less clear. Much like Glu 112 in the wild-type enzyme, Asp 112 forms a hydrogen bond with N(cid:228) of His 136 and thereby slightly repositions the imidazole group. His 136 moves 0.4  closer to the positions of both Asp 112 and C1 of D-ribulose 5-phosphate. In the KGPDC reaction catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme, His 136 was proposed to transfer a proton to C1 of the enediolate D-ribulose 5-phosphate via an intervening water molecule. In the mutant, the shorter Asp 112 moves His 136 closer to C1 of the D-ribulose 5-phosphate so that it now likely can directly mediate proton abstraction.  That the increase in the promiscuous HPS reaction catalyzed by the E112D/T169A mutant is synergistic rather than additive when compared to the activities of the com- ponent mutants requires a functional interaction even though these residues are separated by several angstroms. Presum- ably both affect formation and stabilization of the 1,2- enediolate intermediate: The T169A mutation likely allows the substrate to bind in a conformation that is more conducive for formation of the intermediate, and E112D substitution positions the general base His 136 for direct proton abstrac- tion rather than via a water molecule (Figure 3A).  Structural Bases for Further Increase in HPS ActiVity in the E112D/R139V/T169A Mutant. The addition of the R139V to the E112D/T169A mutant further enhances the promiscu- ous HPS reaction: the triple mutant exhibits a 260-fold increase in the value of kcat/Km relative to wild-type KGPDC, a 6-fold increase relative to the value for the double mutant (14). The triple mutant was crystallized in the presence of D-ribulose 5-phosphate. From the electron density all three substitutions were clear. The electron density for the bound D-ribulose 5-phosphate was clear, and the stereochemical configuration about C4 was unambiguous (Figure 3B). As in the structure of the liganded E112D/T169A mutant, the shorter Asp 112 pulls His 136 closer to C1 of the bound D-ribulose 5-phosphate.  FIGURE 3: (A) Stereoview of the active site of the E112D/T169A double mutant with D-ribulose 5-phosphate bound (yellow) overlaid on top of the structure of wild-type enzyme (green). The glutamate to aspartate substitution causes a shift in the position of the His136 side chain. The threonine to alanine substitution causes a change in the conformation of the substrate. (B) Stereoview of the active site of the E112D/R139V/T169A triple mutant (yellow) overlaid on top of the wild-type enzyme (green). The addition of the arginine to valine mutation results in the absence of ordered water molecules adjacent to C1 of the substrate and may allow greater accessibility for formaldehyde to bind.    In this structure, both water molecules that were associated with proton transfer from His 136 and Arg 139 to either face of the 1,2-enediolate are conspicuously absent, while most other ordered water molecules observed in the active site of wild-type KGPDC remain in essentially identical positions. In the natural KGPDC reaction catalyzed by the wild-type protein, Arg 139 has been proposed to transfer a proton via an intervening water molecule to the re-face of C1 of the 1,2-enediolate intermediate to generate L-xylulose 5-phos- phate. Therefore, the replacement of Arg 139 with Val may improve the access of the electrophilic formaldehyde to the enediolate intermediate, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the promiscuous HPS reaction.   FIGURE 4: Stereoview of the active site of the E112D/R139V/T169A triple mutant with bound L-xylulose 5-phosphate. In the presence of the decarboxylation reaction product, ordered water molecules, associated with the protonation step in the decarboxylation reaction, are observed in the active site, unlike when D-ribulose 5-phosphate is bound.    Taken together, the structures of the E112D/T169A and E112D/R139V/T169A mutants suggest that the D-ribulose 5-phosphate substrate for the promiscuous HPS reaction must be correctly positioned for enhanced enolization (E112D and T169A) and subsequent reaction with a proximal formalde- hyde (R139V).  Ability of Mutants To Catalyze the Natural KGPDC Reaction. Although the substitutions for Glu 112, Arg 139, and Thr 169 can significantly enhance the promiscuous HPS reaction, their effects on the natural KGPDC reaction are more modest. In order to understand this effect, the structure of the E112D/R139V/T169A mutant was determined in the presence of the L-xylulose 5-phosphate product of the natural KGPDC reaction. Surprisingly, significant changes in active site geometry were observed compared to the complex of the same mutant liganded with the 4-epimeric D-ribulose 5-phosphate. The region surrounding Val 139 was clearly defined for the triple mutant in the presence of D-ribulose 5-phosphate, but the region from Arg 137 to Gly 150 was not well ordered in the presence of L-xylulose 5-phosphate; indeed, Val 139 was not visible. Perhaps more surprising is the effect of the configuration of the bound ligand on the ordered, general acidic water molecules observed in the complex of wild-type KGPDC with L-xylulose 5-phosphate. These are absent in the complex of the triple mutant with D-ribulose 5-phosphate but are present in the complex with L-xylulose 5-phosphate (Figure 4). Thus, the configuration of C4 of the bound ligand can trigger a structural change between the presence of the ordered, acidic water molecules required for the KGPDC reaction and their absence to allow unimpeded access of formaldehyde to the enediolate inter- mediate in the HPS reaction.  Implications for Enzyme EVolution. The promiscuity of wild-type KGPDC may provide a snapshot of a step in a pathway for divergent evolution of function: the same active site can catalyze either the natural decarboxylation of 3-keto- L-gulonate 6-phosphate or the promiscuous aldol condensa- tion between D-ribulose 5-phosphate and formaldehyde, albeit with different efficiencies. Both reactions involve the Mg2+- dependent stabilization of a 1,2-enediolate intermediate, although the mechanisms by which the intermediates are formed and are partitioned to products are distinct. Our discovery that a limited number of substitutions can dramati- cally enhance the efficiency of the promiscuous reaction emphasizes that the active site of KGPDC is poised to evolve. Changes in (1) the position the general base His 136 induced by the E112D substitution, (2) the conformation of both the bound substrate and the resulting enediolate intermediate induced by the T169A substitution, and (3) access of formaldehyde to the enediolate intermediate induced by the R139V substitution together enhance the efficiency of the promiscuous aldol condensation. Presumably, selective pres- sure could have allowed Nature to identify remote substitu- tions that would further enhance the efficiency to the level observed for wild-type HPS, if KGPDC were the progenitor of HPS.  CONCLUSIONS  In the absence of a structure for a wild-type HPS, we have been able to enhance the promiscuity of KGPDC for catalysis of the HPS reaction. Our sequence-based choice of substitu- tions was based on mimicking the observed differences in conserved residues that are associated uniquely with the natural KGPDC- and HPS-catalyzed reactions. From the outset, it was difficult to predict the effects of the substitu- tions on the structure of the active site and how these would alter the efficiency of the HPS reaction, though, of course, the structure of the native enzyme was a great help in guiding the choice of mutations. From the structural information presented in this manuscript, however, it must be recognized that subtle structural changes can have profound but readily rationalized effects on catalysis. The success of this endeavor also emphasizes that evolution of new functions in proteins possessing the ((cid:226)/R)8-barrel fold can be readily achieved by altering the identities of the residues positioned at the ends of the component (cid:226)-strands that form the active site. Substitutions in these structurally independent positions can produce synergistic changes in catalytic activity, thereby highlighting the utility of this fold in the divergent evolution of new functions.

This enzyme catalyzes not only the dehydration of 2-succinyl-6R-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1R-carboxylate but also cata- lyzes racemization of dierent acylamino acids, with N-succinyl-R-phenyl- glycine being the best substrate. We investigated the molecular mechanisms for both reactions exploring the potential energy surface. Then, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to obtain the free energy proles and the averaged interaction energies of enzymatic residues with the reacting system. Our results conrm the plausibility of the reaction mechanisms proposed in the literature, with a good agreement between theoretical and experimentally derived activation free energies. Our simulations unravel the role played by the dierent residues in each of the two possible reactions. The presence of exible loops in the active site and the selection of structural modications in the substrate seem to be key elements to promote the promiscuity of this enzyme.  1. INTRODUCTION Many eorts have been devoted during the last years to improve the understanding of the mechanism of action of natural enzymes15 and apply this knowledge to the develop- ment of new biocatalysts.6,7 Scientists began to use evolutionary strategies (directed evolution)8 to tailor the properties of individual molecules. Random mutations or recombination can, in many cases, be done eciently, leading in this way to molecular evolution in the laboratory. On the other side, rational design can be used to guide the direct mutations of the enzyme.9 Molecular residues at specic positions of simulations appear to be nowadays a promising option for computer-based design. Nevertheless, the most active computa- tionally designed enzymes usually perform modestly in comparison with the natural enzymes.1013  The development of new specic functions in an enzyme is something that Nature has already done through evolution, although the evolutionary routes followed to reach this goal remain to be revealed. While closely related proteins can have dierent functions, some distantly related enzymes can have the same or similar function. Evolution could have taken advantage of enzymes presenting promiscuous activities. This promiscuity can be classied in three categories: substrate promiscuity (the enzyme accepts dierent substrates catalyzing the same reaction), catalytic promiscuity (the enzyme accepts dierent substrates catalyzing dierent reactions) and product promis- cuity (the enzyme accepts a single substrate and catalyzes the formation of dierent products).1418 Promiscuity provides a raw starting point for the evolution of enzymes, as a new duplicated gene presenting low activity would be the germ for  adaptive evolution.15 This ability endows organisms with a selective advantage and thereby enables their survival and further evolution. Studying protein evolution from promiscuous enzymes oers the possibility to obtain valuable experiences for the design of new biocatalysts.  In this paper we focus on a promiscuous enzyme member of the enolase superfamily, a large group of enzymes that catalyzes dierent reactions distributed in 7 subgroups.19 All enzymes belonging to this superfamily use a common mechanistic rst step consisting in the abstraction of an -proton next to a carboxylate group, leading to the formation of an enediolate anion intermediate stabilized by the presence of a divalent cation in the active site (usually Mg2+). The active site positioned in a cavity formed by the C-terminal ends of the - strands of the barrel domain and the substrate lies sandwiched between the catalytic acid/base residues.20 The Muconate lactonizing subgroup of the family is characterized by the presence of a conserved Lys-X-Lys motif at the end of the second -strand and a lysine at the end of the sixth -strand. These lysine residues are located at opposite faces of the active site, allowing proton transfer reactions to/from both faces of the substrate. The o-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS) enzyme from Amycolatopsis belongs to this subgroup and was rst assigned as a racemase and designated as N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR). However, it was later discovered that this enzyme is a better catalyst for a specic syn dehydration reaction that happens during o-succinylbenzoate synthesis and was then designated as o-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS).21 OSBS is thus an example of an enzyme with catalytic promiscuity. Other members of the enolase superfamily also present the ability to catalyze dehydration and racemization reactions either for the same (product promiscuity) or dierent substrates (catalytic promiscuity).22,23    Scheme 1. Proposed Reaction Mechanisms for the OSBS (a) and NAAAR (b) Reactions Catalyzed by OSBS of Amycolatopsis     OSBS from Amycolatopsis catalyzes the two dierent reactions mentioned before (see Scheme 1): (i) the dehydration of 2-succinyl-6R-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1R- carboxylate (SHCHC) to o-succinylbenzoate (OSB) (OSBS reaction; see Scheme 1a) and (ii) the N-acyloamino acids racemization (NAAAR reaction; see Scheme 1b). The NAAAR reaction can be enhanced using substrates that closely resembles SHCHC. One of the best substrates is N-succinyl- (R)-phenylglycine (NSRPG) that is converted into N-succinyl- (S)-phenylglycine (NSSPG) (see Scheme 1b)). The rst step in both reactions requires the abstraction of a proton next to a carboxylate group of the substrate carried out by the deprotonated Lys 163. It has been proposed that the second step in the OSBS reaction consists in the dehydration of the substrate assisted by the conjugate acid of Lys 163, while the NAAAR reaction utilizes Lys 263 in the 1,1-proton transfer reaction to yield the substrate enantiomer.24   In this work we present a theoretical analysis of the reaction mechanisms for the OSBS/NAAAR enzyme from Amycola- topsis, using SHCHC and NSRPG as substrates. The potential energy surfaces of both reactions have been explored using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid methods in order to determine the reliability of the proposed mechanisms. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been  carried out in order to obtain the corresponding potentials of mean force (PMFs) or free energy proles and to investigate the role of the dierent proteinsubstrate interactions during the binding of the substrate and in the stabilization of the transition state (TS). These simulations can highlight into the origin of enzyme promiscuity and thus serve as a useful guide for the computational design of new functions into existing proteins.  2. METHODOLOGY  Preparation of the System. Theoretical studies were performed starting with the crystallized structure of the OSBS enzyme that appears in the Protein Data Bank with code 1SJB.25 This structure includes the OSB substrate and the magnesium ion. According to experimental data, OSBS from Amycolatopsis assembles as an octamer.25 Active sites are found inside each subunit, with residues of the closer subunit placed at 15  from the active site chosen to model the reaction (chain B). Our model consisted of two subunits, chains A and B and the distance between the active sites of these two subunits is about 30 . The crystal structure contains the product of the OSBS reaction (OSB, see Scheme 1). A schematic representation of the main interactions established by OSB in the 1SJB structure is shown in Figure S1 as Supporting Information. The OSB molecule was transformed into the reactant (SHCHC) adding a hydrogen atom to the C atom and a hydroxyl group to the C atom. After the chemical transformation the internal geometry of the substrate was fully relaxed. The protonation state of titratable residues at pH 7 was determined using the program PropKa 3.1.2629 All the histidine residues located at the surface of our model system were considered to be protonated in order to reduce the net charge of the system. During preliminary simulations we observed that His 225 can be anked by Asp 221 and Glu 218 and then this residue was also assumed to be protonated in our model. The pKa values predicted by PropKa for Lys 163 and 263 of chain B (the selected one to model the reaction in its active site) were 7.15 and 9.14 respectively. Theses pKa values depend on protein conformation and on the nature of the substrate. Results were similar for PDB structure 1SJC25 that contains N-succinylmethionine in the active site; 6.47 and 9.00, respectively. However, the computed values were smaller (4.55 and 6.52 for Lys 163 and Lys 263, respectively) for structure 1SJA25 (chain B) that contains a dierent substrate: N-succinylacetate. In any case, these values are consistent with a protonation state adequate for the forward reactions as depicted in Scheme 1: Lys 163, which acts as a base in both reactions, is considered to be unprotonated at the reactant state, whereas Lys 263, that a acts as acid in the NAAAR reaction, is protonated. We did not consider the 1SJD25 structure because it lacks the magnesium ion and the substrate (NSRPG) is found in a nonproductive orientation with respect the catalytic lysines.    Hydrogen atoms were added using the fDynamo pro- gram.30,31 The system was solvated with a pre-equilibrated water box of 100  80  80  of size centered on the substrate. Water molecules placed at less than 2.8  from any other non- hydrogen atom of the system were deleted. To neutralize the system, 5 sodium atoms were added. In order to reduce the computational time, a sphere of 25  centered on the substrate was dened and the atoms outside that sphere were kept xed. A representation of the simulated system is provided as Supporting Information (Figure S2). To study the reaction a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) Hamiltonian was employed. The quantum region (QM) contains the substrate and the side-chains of those residues directly involved in the reactions: Lys 163 and Lys 263. In addition, in order to model correctly the possible charge transfer between the negatively charged substrate and the metal center,32 we also included in the QM subsystem the magnesium ion and the side-chains of the residues that are part of its coordination shell (Asp 189, Glu 214, Asp 239, and a water molecule). Figure 1 shows the QM regions for the study of the OSBS reaction (Figure 1a) and the QM region for the NAAAR reaction (Figure 1b). The QM subsystem was described at AM133 and M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)34,35 levels. The M06 level is clearly superior to the semiempirical AM1 treatment but, because of the computational cost, the former was used only for the exploration of the potential energy surface, while the latter was employed also for QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations. In any case our results show (see below) that the geometrical description obtained at the semiempirical level is in good agreement with the higher QM level and that single- point energy corrections can be applied to obtain a reasonable quantitative picture of the reaction energetics. For the classical region (MM), the OPLS-AA36,37 and TIP3P38 force elds, as implemented in fDynamo,30,31 were used to describe the protein and the water molecules, respectively. The link atom approach39 was used to saturate the valence of the QM/MM frontier. These link atoms were placed between C and C atoms of each residue in the QM subsystem (see Figure 1).  In order to prepare the system for the study of the NAAAR reaction, the SHCHC molecule was replaced by NSRPG overlapping the optimized substrate structures to get an adequate initial pose of the new substrate into the active site. The nal systems consisted of a dimeric enzyme complexed with the substrate (SHCHC for the OSBS reaction and NSRPG for the NAAAR reaction) and a box of water molecules and counterions. The OSBS system contains 60868 atoms of which 10565 were considered as mobile atoms including 83 atoms in the QM region; whereas the NAAAR system contains 60870 atoms in total of which 10567 were mobile and 85 QM (see Figure S2).

(c) Overlap of the SHCHC (blue) and NSRPG (red) structures at the active site, showing the position of the catalytic lysines and some residues of loop 20.  Simulations, performed using the fDynamo library, employed a switched cuto from 12 to 14  for all nonbonded interactions, including those established between atoms in the rigid and exible regions. The system was rst optimized and equilibrated by means of a combination of steepest-descent and conjugate gradient optimizations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. First, solvent molecules were minimized and equilibrated while the rest of the system was kept frozen. Second, solvent molecules and side chains were relaxed and nally the whole system was minimized and gradually heated from 0 to 298 K. The system was equilibrated with a series of QM/MM MD simulations covering a total of 550 ps in the NVT ensemble using a LangevinVerlet integrator40 with a time a step of 0.5 fs. Snapshots of SHCHC and NSRPG equilibrated in the active site of the enzyme are provided in Figure 2, parts a and b. The overlap of these congurations is shown in Figure 2c.    Potential Energy Surface Exploration. The potential energy surfaces (PES) for both the OSBS and NAAAR reactions were obtained starting from optimized structures of reactants and reaching the transition state structures through scans of selected reaction coordinates. Putative TS structures were located and their nature determined by diagonalization of the Hessian matrix corresponding to the subset of QM atoms. TS structures have a single imaginary frequency and thus they are true saddle points on the PES (there is just one direction in which the energy decreases while the structure is a minimum in all the rest). Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)41 paths were traced down to reactant/intermediate/product valleys from the saddle points. The nal structures were optimized and their nature conrmed from analysis of the Hessian. All these calculations were performed using the micro/macroiteration optimization algorithm.4244 The PESs were explored using the antisymmetric combination of the distances associated with the proton transfer from the substrate to Lys 163 (d(CH) and d(HN Lys 163)) for the rst step of the mechanisms for both substrates. For the second mechanistic step of the NAAAR reaction we obtained the PES using as reaction coordinate the antisymmetric combination of the distances that control the proton transfer from Lys 263 to the C atom of the substrate (d(H Lys 263N Lys 263) and d(CH Lys 263)). For the second step of the OSBS reaction we used the antisymmetric combination of the distances associated with the proton transfer from Lys 163 to the hydroxyl group in  position (d(OH Lys 163) and d(N Lys 163H Lys 163)) and the distance of the oxygen atom of this group to the C atom (d(CO)). The PES exploration was carried rst out at the AM1/MM level and the obtained structures were used as initial guess for M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)/MM calculations using a combination of fDynamo and GAUSSIAN09 programs.45  Free Energy Calculations. Potentials of mean force (PMFs) were obtained for the OSBS and NAAAR reactions at the AM1/MM level. These PMFs provide the free energy change along selected reaction coordinates. Antisymmetric combinations of the distances describing the breaking and forming bonds were employed as distinguished reaction coordinates (RCs). The selected distances depend on the reaction and the step studied (see below). The umbrella sampling approach46 was used to constraint the system close to a particular value of the RC by means of the addition of a harmonic potential with a force constant of 2500 kJmol12, which allowed good overlap between consecutive simulation windows. The probability distributions obtained from MD simulations within each individual window were combined by means of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM)47 to obtain the whole PMF. Each simulation window consisted in 10 ps of relaxation and 20 ps of production, with a time step of 0.5 fs. Simulations were carried out in the NVT ensemble with a reference temperature of 298 K and the LangevinVerlet integrator.40 In the OSBS reaction, the PMF corresponding to the rst step was traced along the d(CH)  d(HN Lys 163) coordinate with a window width of 0.03  and the total number of windows was 100. For the second step we traced a two- dimensional PMF along d(OH Lys 163)  d(N Lys 163H Lys 163) and d(CO), with a window width of 0.05  and 1600 windows. For the NAAAR reaction, in the rst step the reaction coordinate (d(CH)  d(HN Lys 163)) was explored along 70 simulation windows with a window width of 0.05 . For the second step the coordinate d(H Lys 263N Lys 263)  d(CH Lys 263) was sampled using 150 windows with a step size of of 0.03 .  The free energy barriers were computed at AM1/MM level and corrected at M06-2X/MM level for the two steps of both OSBS and NAAAR reactions. In particular, we obtained corrected free energy barriers by applying the following equation:    G corr  =  G   AM MM  1/  +  (  E  TS    E ) R HL    (  E  TS    E ) R AM  1  (1) The potential energy barriers appearing in the previous expression have been obtained by means of single-point calculations on optimized reactant and TS structures localized using a micromacro iteration approach.4244 These structures are optimized using a Hessian-based search for the QM atoms while the MM atoms are fully optimized at each step of this search using only gradients. In eq 1, HL stands for the high level chosen to obtain the corrected estimation of the activation free energy. In our case M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)34,35 has been used. HL calculations are carried out under the eect of the eld created by the MM environment.  Interaction Energies. In order to elucidate the role of the dierent residues in each of the two reactions catalyzed by this enzyme, we computed the averaged interaction energies of these residues with the reacting subsystem (the substrate and lysines 163 and 263, see Figure 1). The average was performed over 100 ps of MD simulations constrained at values of the reaction coordinate corresponding to reactant and transition states, as determined from the corresponding PMFs. The averaged interaction energy of a given residue j was obtained as   E   =  int,  j  1 N  N   =  1  i  |  H i QM MM j ,  /  | i  (2)      aM  (3)  aM  where N is the number of congurations analyzed (1000 in our case), the wave function ( i) corresponds to that of the polarized reacting subsystem and the interaction Hamiltonian with residue j is dened as    i M j A aM 12 R      M j     =      Z q a M R      M j  QM MM j ,  B R  aM 6  q r  +  +    H  aM  M  iM  /  including the electrostatic and van der Waals terms. These calculations were carried out at the AM1/MM level.  We have also compared the averaged interaction energies obtained for each residue at the transition states of both reactions with those obtained for their corresponding reactants. The contribution of the interaction energy of each residue to the barrier can be calculated as the dierence of the interaction established in the transition state and reactant state:       E j TS  =  E j int, TS and ...  E int , where ... R denote averages over the transition and reactant states of the reaction, respectively, and the subscript (j) refers to the residue number.   j R  (4)  int,  3. RESULTS AND DICUSSION  3.1. Exploring the Reaction Mechanisms. Location and characterization of the stationary structures corresponding to a given reaction mechanism (reactants, products, transition structures and possible intermediates) allow determining its feasibility from the inspection of the energy barriers and the total energy change. Tracing the reaction paths along these structures provides detailed information about the molecular characteristics of the mechanism: the stepwise or concerted nature of the process and the degree of synchronicity between bond breaking and forming events. The use of QM/MM methods has facilitated the application of accurate QM methods to the exploration of reaction mechanisms in large systems, such as in enzymatic processes. We investigated the mechanistic proposal of Gerlt and co-workers (see Scheme 1)24 at the M06-2X/MM level. This method has been successfully used to determine the energetics associated with chemical reactions.34,35 PESs traced along the aforementioned coor- dinates were used to select good initial guesses for the optimization of all the relevant structures (reactant, products, TSs and intermediates). Some key geometrical parameters of the optimized structures, together with the values of the relative energies and the imaginary frequencies are provided in Table 1.  Table 1.

We also explored the reaction mechanisms using the much less computationally demanding (and usually less accurate) AM1/MM level. Results are presented as Supporting Information (Table S1 and Figure S3). All the stationary structures are shown in Figures S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information. In general, the AM1 calculations provide the same qualitative picture for the reaction mechanisms. Geometrically, the resulting stationary structures are very similar to those obtained at the M06-2X level. This agreement is important because gives support to the use of the much less computa- tionally demanding AM1/MM method during QM/MM MD simulations. During these simulations (see below) the number of generated structures is much larger than during the exploration of the PES and thus these calculations can be only carried out at the semiempricial level. The larger dierence observed between both QM levels is found in the energy of the intermediate relative to the reactants, which seems to be overestimated at the AM1/MM level.    Figure 3. Potential energy proles obtained for the OSBS (left) and NAAAR (right) reactions determined at the M06-2X/MM level. The structures of the reacting subsystem at the TSs are also represented.    The rst step, the proton abstraction from C by the unprotonated Lys 163, is very similar for both substrates. The proton is being transferred from C to the N atom of Lys 163 and at the transition structures (TS1) the distances of the proton to the donor and acceptor atoms (HC and HN, see Table 1) are similar for both substrates. The proton transfer is somewhat earlier for SHCHC where the proton-donor distance (HC) is 1.34 , while for NSRPG the distance at TS1 is 1.38 . In both the OSBS and the NAAAR reactions this proton transfer is assisted by the presence of the Mg2+ ion, as reected in the reduction of the distances between this ion and the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the substrate observed at the enediolate intermediate (see O1Mg and O2Mg distances for structures in Table S2 of Supporting Information). The remaining distances dening the coordination shell of the ion are almost unaltered in both reactions (see Table S2 of Supporting Information). At the M06-2X level the energy barrier for this rst step is more favorable for the SHCHC substrate (9.1 kcalmol1) than for NSRPG (12.5 kcalmol1). However, the dierences are small considering that these values can uctuate depending on the particular conformation analyzed (see discussion below). Our calculations show that, in the active site, the enediolate intermediates are almost isoenergetic with NSRPG (the energy dierence being 0.5 kcal mol1) or even slightly more stable than SHCHC (2.5 kcal mol1).  The OSBS and NAAAR reactions dier in the second step, the transformation followed by the enediolate intermediate to form the nal product (OSB or NSSPG, see Scheme 1). In the case of the OSBS reaction, Lys 163 transfers the proton to the oxygen atom (O) of the hydroxyl group placed in position  to the carboxylate group, forming a water with respect molecule. Dehydration of the intermediate leads to the formation of the nal product, OSB, an aromatic compound, resulting in an exothermic process (see Figure 3). At the corresponding transition structure (TS2) both the proton transfer and the OC bond cleavage are advanced. The O C distance has been increased from 1.49 to 1.83 , while the proton transferred from Lys 163 is found at 1.37  of the hydroxyl oxygen atom (see OH in Table 1). The energy barrier for the dehydration of the enediolate intermediate is 15.7 kcalmol1 at the M06-2X/MM level.  For the NSRPG substrate the second step proceeds by means of a proton transfer from protonated Lys 263 back to the C atom to produce the substrate enantiomer NSSPG. The geometry of the transition structure (TS2-NAAAR) corre- sponds to an earlier structure with the proton-donor distance (HN) shorter than the proton-acceptor one (HC); 1.32 and 1.43 , respectively. The energy barrier determined from the reaction intermediate is 13.4 kcalmol1 at the M06-2X level. This reaction is only slightly exothermic at the M06-2X level.  It is interesting to note that the distance from C to the H atoms of Lys 263 at the intermediate is larger for the SHCHC substrate than for NSRPG (2.88 and 2.37  at the M06-2X level, respectively, see Table S2 of Supporting Information). This larger distance could prevent the racemization reaction in the case of SHCHC. The energy barrier for a hypothetic proton transfer from Lys 263 would increase above the value obtained for the second step of the OSBS process. There are several factors that contribute to the dierent reaccommodation of the substrate in the active site. First, C atom of SHCHC is part of a ring, rendering it less exible. Second, the hydroxyl substituent on C establishes a hydrogen bond with Lys 163, favoring the displacement of the substrate in the active site away from Lys 263. Finally, in the case of the NSRPG substrate the NH group of the amide substituent makes a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly 291 (2.37  at the M06- 2X level in the intermediate state), favoring the approach of this substrate to Lys 263. In any case, because of the large exothermicity of the OSBS reaction, a hypothetical production of the SHCHC enantiomer would probably be transient and this product would not accumulate.        Proofs of a reaction mechanism can be obtained from the determination of kinetic isotope eects (KIEs), this is the ratio between the rate constants obtained upon isotopic substitution into a particular position of the chemical system. Up to our knowledge, only the primary deuterium isotope eect was measured for the kinetic constants for the OSBS enzyme from Escherichia coli. The KIE value obtained from the catalytic rate constants was 6.1  0.4, indicating a mechanism dominated by proton transfer.48 We determined the M06-2X values of semiclassical KIEs corresponding to isotopic substitutions of non-hydrogen atoms during the rate-limiting step of the OSBS and NAAAR reactions, which could be useful for the experimental conrmation of the proposed mechanisms. Values obtained for C, C, and O atoms were larger than unity, indicating a diminution of the force constant associated with them at the TS. KIEs and details about their calculation are given in the Supporting Information (see Table S3).   Table 2.

Free Energy Proles. For reactions involving a small number of atoms, the characterization of a few stationary structures is usually enough to characterize the process and to calculate free energies that can be compared to experimental equilibrium and rate constants. These free energies are usually obtained by means of the application of the harmonic approximation for the displacements from the stationary structures. However, this approach does not hold for reactions involving many degrees of freedom (such as enzymatic reactions) where the PES is usually rough and many dierent congurations must be considered in order to obtain averaged values to be compared to experimental properties. The energy proles presented above must be considered with caution because they represent the energy paths for a particular conformation of the system but, in principle, many reaction paths are possible in an enzymatic environment as a the large number of nearly degenerate consequence of conformations accessible for the system on the complex PES.5,49,50 Thus, we carried out QM/MM MD simulations to determine the free energy proles or PMFs corresponding to the mechanisms described above. During these simulations many congurations are generated and the free energy changes associated with the reaction were obtained from the probability distribution of distinguished reaction coordinates selected from the previous exploration of the PES. Because of their computational cost these simulations were carried out only at the AM1/MM level. According to the results presented in the Supporting Information, the AM1 method gives a reasonable geometric and energetic description of the reaction mechanism, except for an overestimation of the energies of the enediolate intermediate and TS2 with respect to the reactants. We thus used the AM1/MM hybrid potential to obtain the free energy proles along the distinguished coordinates and we corrected a posteriori the free energy values by means of single-point energy calculations at the higher M06-2X level (as explained in the Methodology).  For the rst step in both OSBS and NAAAR reactions we used the antisymmetric combination of the distances of the transferred proton to the N atom of Lys 163 and to the C atom of the substrate (d(CH)  d(HN Lys 163)) as the distinguished reaction coordinate. The total number of simulation windows used to obtain the PMF was 100 in each case. A similar procedure was used for the second step of the NAAAR reaction where the coordinate was the antisymmetric combination of the distances of the transferred proton to the N atom of Lys 263 and to the C atom of the substrate (d(H Lys 263N Lys 263)  d(CH Lys 263)). For the OSBS reaction, two distinguished coordinates were employed to obtain a smooth two-dimensional PMF (2D-PMF) correspond- ing to the second reaction step. These coordinates were the antisymmetric combination of the distances of the transferred proton to the N atom of Lys 163 and to the O atom of the substrate (d(OH Lys 163)  d(N Lys 163H Lys 163)) and the CO distance. A total of 1600 simulation windows were employed to calculate this two-dimensional PMF. The PMFs obtained for the two steps of both reactions are shown in Figure S6 of the Supporting Information, while the relative AM1/MM free energies and averaged distances are given in Table 2. Free energy dierences corrected by means of single- point calculations at the M06-2X/MM level are also presented in Table 2.       Figure 4. Average interaction energies of each enzymatic residue with the reacting subsystem (substrate + Lys 163 + Lys 263) for the reactant state of the OSBS and NAAAR reactions. The red lines correspond to subunit-A residues, the blue one to subunit-B, the green color is for the magnesium ion, and the black one is for the sum of this ion and its coordination shell. The inset shows the interaction energies of the residues of loops 20 and 50.   The free energy proles obtained from these simulations roughly match the potential energy proles presented in Figure 3, validating the mechanistic description given above. This is also conrmed by an analysis of the averaged distances presented in Table 2, which are in reasonable agreement with the optimized values presented in Table 1 and Tables S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information. In addition, our best estimation of the activation free energies obtained from the highest energy TSs (the single-point corrected free energies, 13.1 and 17.3 kcalmol1 corresponding to TS2 for the OSBS and NAAAR processes, respectively) are compatible with the values expected for enzymatic processes. In particular, the free energy barriers obtained from the application of transition state theory (TST) to the experimental rate constants24 determined at 25 C are 14.3 and 14.6 kcalmol1 for NAAAR and OSBS reactions, respectively. These values must be considered with caution because the experimental assays used Mn2+ because it provides a 3-fold enhancement in the rate of the NAAAR reaction relative to Mg2+.24 However, this dierence in the rate constants translates into a small change in the activation free energy (less than 1 kcalmol1). Our free energy proles also agree with the experimental observation that the values of the rate constant for the proton exchange exceed those for racemization24 because our energy proles show that TS2 of the NAAAR reaction presents a free energy slightly higher than for TS1. It should be taken into account that we have not considered quantum corrections to the classical activation free energy (zero point energies and tunneling) that typically contribute to decrease the calculated activation free energies in H-transfer processes.51,52   With respect to the reaction energies, our results show that the OSBS process is clearly exergonic (the reaction free energy being 17.5 kcalmol1, see Table 2) in agreement with the experimental observation.20,48 Instead, the NAAAR reaction is almost thermoneutral (0.3 kcalmol1) This implies that the activation free energies and the catalytic rate constant will be very similar for the reverse reaction, the transformation of NSSPG into NSRPG, in agreement with the observation that this reaction occurs in both directions at nearly equal rates.24 3.3. Analysis of Interactions Relevant for Catalysis. Once we have presented the results of the QM/MM calculations and checked that these results reasonably agree with experimental observations, we can use our simulations to provide a detailed molecular picture of the processes and the basis for the catalytic promiscuity of the OSBS/NAAAR enzyme from Amycolatopsis. As explained in the Methodology, the average interaction energies of the dierent residues with the reacting subsystem (the substrate and lysines 163 and 263) were computed using eq 2. The results of these interaction energies for the most relevant residues and their standard deviations are provided as Supporting Information (Tables S4 and S5).    We rst analyzed the role of each residue in the formation of the corresponding Michaelis complexes for the OSBS and NAAAR reactions. Figure 4 represents the interaction energies for each residue at the OSBS and NAAAR reactant states. A negative value means that a particular residue stabilizes the reactant state, favoring the binding of the substrate and/or the positioning of the reacting fragments (including the catalytic lysines); while a positive value indicates a destabilizing contribution. As expected, in both cases the largest contribu- tions in absolute values come from the charged residues. The substrates (SHCHC and NSRPG) are both negatively charged and thus positively charged residues contribute to binding, while negatively charged residues destabilize the reactant complex. These chargecharge interactions are expected to make a similar global contribution in dierent residues with the same charge and dierent enzymes with similar active sites (as the OSBS enzyme from E. coli). The largest contribution comes from the Mg2+ ion, 211.1 and 222.7 kcalmol1 for SHCHC and NSRPG, respectively. However, this value is largely reduced when considering together the contributions from the ion and the residues of its coordination shell (Asp 239, Asp 189, Glu 214, and a water molecule) as deduced from the comparison of the green and black lines in Figure 4. The interaction energies of the ion plus its coordination shell are 79.3 and 89.7 kcalmol1 for SHCHC and NSRPG, respectively. Other residues with a large stabilizing contribution are Lys 161, Arg 266, Arg 299, and Arg 322, all of them positively charged. Destabilizing contributions, apart from the coordination shell of the Mg2+ ion, come from Glu 294 and Asp 316. The contacts made by these and other residues with the chemical system are presented in Scheme 2.  Small favorable interactions are also observed between the substrate and residues found in two loops that close over the active site, known as loop 20 and loop 50 because of the position of these loops in the sequences of many members of the superfamily (see Figure 2c). These interaction energies are shown as an insert in Figure 4. Although the values are signicantly smaller than for the charged residues, these interactions could be important to dierentiate between residues with equal charges. It has been proposed that the dierent orientation of the loop 20 in Amycolatopsis OSBS/ NAAAR and E. coli OSBS could explain the absence of the NAAAR activity in this last enzyme.53 This loop seems to play dierent roles in dierent members of the enolase superfamily, being essential for both the synthase and racemization activities in Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR.54 Our interaction energies show that Phe 19, Thr 21 and Tyr 55 make favorable contacts at the reactant states of both the OSBS and NAAAR reactions. The rst two residues contact and orient the catalytic lysine (Lys 163) in agreement with the recent suggestion that the main role of loop 20 would be to hold the catalytic lysine close to the active site and to orient it properly.53,55 Phe 19 and Tyr 55 make hydrophobic contacts with the ring of the substrates. It has been recently observed that mutating Phe 19 in Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR decreased substrate binding in both activities.54 Our simulations show that the role of this loop in Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR is similar in the reactant state of both reactions, indicating that the loop 20 could have the exibility needed to allow the promiscuous activity of this enzyme. The position of the loop could be easily adapted to accommodate slightly dierent orientations of the substrate ring in the active site, as observed in Figure 2c. The positioning of loop 20 on the active site seems to be slightly dierent at the reactant states of the OSBS and NAAAR processes, optimizing the interactions with the dierent substrates (SHCHC and NSRPG, respectively). Instead, it has been suggested that the E. coli OSBS could be evolutionarily optimized to increase substrate binding of the SHCHC substrate, rendering this enzyme less likely for a promiscuous function.53 Mutagenesis studies on E. coli OSBS indicate that loop 20 in this enzyme is more important to keep the structural integrity of the active site than for determining the enzyme specicity.5456 In fact, deletion of the loop 20 results in a larger reduction of the catalytic eciency for Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR enzyme than for the E. coli enzyme. This dierence is due to the fact that loop 20 of E. coli enzyme is only partially closed when the substrate is bound and thus the residues of this loop do not strongly interact with the substrate. In contrast, the loop 20 of Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR enzyme completely closes the active site and their residues form an important part of the substrate binding pocket.54 Thus, dierences in the loop 20 between promiscuous Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR enzyme and nonpromiscuous E. coli OSBS enzyme could be an important factor determining the presence of NAAAR activity. However, it must be pointed out that mutations on the loop 20 of Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR enzyme reduced both the synthase and the racemase activities, suggesting that evolution of this loop were not the only changes needed to evolve the latter activity.54 As discussed below other residues contribute to accelerate the racemase activity in Amycolatopsis OSBS/ NAAAR.studies on E. coli OSBS indicate that loop 20 in this enzyme is more important to keep the structural integrity of the active site than for determining the enzyme specicity.5456 In fact, deletion of the loop 20 results in a larger reduction of the catalytic eciency for Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR enzyme than for the E. coli enzyme.

Figure 5. Dierences in the interaction energies of each residue with the reacting subsystem (substrate + Lys 163 + Lys 263) averaged at TS2 and reactants state, for the OSBS and NAAAR reactions. The red lines corresponds to subunit-A residues, the blue lines to subunit-B, green color is for the magnesium ion and the black one for the sum of this ion and its coordination shell. A negative value means that a particular residue stabilizes the TS more than the reactant state. The inset shows the dierences in the average interaction energies of the residues found in loops 20 and 50.    We have analyzed the contribution of the interaction energy of each residue to the barrier using eq 4. A negative value means that a particular residue stabilizes the TS more than the reactant state and this contributes to increase kcat. A positive value of the dierence means that that residue stabilizes the reactant state more than the TS and this contributes to decrease kcat. Figure 5 presents the results obtained for TS2 of  both reactions. A similar representation for TS1 is given as Supporting Information (Figure S7). Here we only analyze the results for TS2 because this transition state corresponds to the step that diers between the OSBS and the NAAAR reactions and, in addition, this step seems to be the rate-limiting step in both cases. When analyzing these dierential interaction energies it is important to take into account the dierent nature of the second step in the OSBS and NAAAR reactions. In the rst case there is a net charge transfer of +1 from Lys 163 to the substrate while in the second step of the NAAAR reaction there is a net charge transfer of +1 from Lys 263 to the substrate. The eect of active site residues depends on the relative position of these with respect to the direction of the charge transfer. This explains the dierent role played by the Mg2+ ion and its coordination shell in both reactions. For the OSBS process, the ion (together with its coordination shell) stabilizes TS2 with respect to the reactant state (24.0 kcal mol1) and thus contributes to catalysis. The ion also plays a catalytic role during the rst step of the two reactions (proton abstraction by Lys 163) as observed in Figure S7 in the in the second step of the Supporting Information. Instead, NAAAR reaction the contribution of the ion (with its coordination shell) to stabilize TS2 relative to the reactant state is negligible (0.1 kcalmol1). In this case, Arg 266 has a larger catalytic contribution in the second step of the NAAAR reaction (14.8 kcalmol1) than in the OSBS reaction (5.5 kcalmol1). This residue is close to Lys 263 and lowers its pKa, facilitating the proton transfer from Lys 263 to the substrate. This residue also plays an important structural role by means of a strong hydrogen bond interaction with Asp 239, which makes part of the coordination shell of the Mg2+ ion. It is important to realize that a similar role is played by Arg 217 in E. coli OSBS, an enzyme that does not show NAAAR activity. Thus, the low pKa of the proton donor needed for this reaction (Lys 263/235 in Amycolatopsis/E. coli) is more likely to be a consequence of the characteristics of an active site designed to bind a negatively charged substrate and not a requirement to catalyze the second step of the NAAAR reaction. In fact, it has been suggested that E. coli OSBS could also exhibit racemase activity against other, yet unidentied, compounds.16 Another important stabilizing interaction at TS2 relative to the reactant state is provided by Asn 191. This is most probably due to the change of the protonation state of Lys 163 (neutral at the reactant state and protonated at TS2) and thus contributes to catalyze the two reactions, although the eect is larger for the NAAAR reaction. Loop 20 residues do not seem to contribute to stabilize TS2 relatively to the reactant. Lys 161 stabilizes both reactant states and contributes to increase the energy barrier in both reactions. Finally, it is interesting to mention that the total interaction energies of the model system with the reactive subsystem at TS2 for both reactions, OSBS and NAAAR is 4 kcalmol1 more favorable for the NAAAR process (407 and 411 kcal mol1, respectively). This small dierence is below the standard deviations (see Tables S4 and S5), which prevents any conclusion about the preference of the protein for one or another process. In any case it seems that the TSs of both processes can be eciently catalyzed in the active site of Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR by means of stabilizing inter- actions.  4. CONCLUSIONS QM/MM simulations oer a detailed molecular picture of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the Amycolatopsis OSBS/ NAAAR enzyme and constitute, together to kinetic, structural and mutagenesis studies, a fundamental tool to understand how enzyme specicity may have evolved. We have explored two dierent reactions catalyzed by this enzyme: (i) the dehydration of 2-succinyl-6R-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1R- carboxylate to o-succinylbenzoate or OSBS reaction and (ii) the N-acyloamino acids racemization, or NAAAR reaction. AM1/ MM and M06-2X/MM calculations were employed to obtain the stationary structures corresponding to the reaction mechanisms of these two processes. In agreement with previous mechanistic proposals we found that both reactions have a rst common step: the abstraction of a C proton from the substrate by an unprotonated lysine present in the active site (Lys 163). The NAAAR reaction then continues with a proton transfer from Lys 263 back to the C atom of the substrate, while in the OSBS process a proton from Lys 163 is transferred to the hydroxyl group in  position releasing a water molecule. Our calculations conrmed the reliability of these proposals. We then obtained the free energy proles for the two mechanisms and explored the average properties of the reactants and transition states. Analysis of the contribution of the interaction energies of each residue to the stability of the reactants and the energy barriers have been used to highlight the origin of the promiscuous activity of this enzyme.  In the particular case of Amycolatopsis OSBS/NAAAR the evolution of a new activity seems to be the consequence of several factors. As a general conclusion, an active site designed to bind a negatively charged residue and to lower the pKa of the base can also be adequate to catalyze a dierent reaction (the racemization process) provided that the new substrate binds to the active site in the appropriate conformation. In the example analyzed in this work the presence of loops in the active site (and in particular the exible loop 20) seems to be a key factor to promote promiscuity. This loop is able to provide similar interactions to dierent substrates, even if they bind into the active site in slightly dierent orientations. However, other residues, apart from this loop, must also contribute to evolve the racemase activity, lowering the barrier for the proton transfer back to the C atom. Obviously, another important element is the selection of the substrate that must contain those structural elements needed to compensate for the interactions lost due to the absence of the hydroxyl group and to reaccommodate the substrate in the adequate binding pose.  The theoretical analysis carried out in this work shows that computational studies of enzymatic promiscuity may provide us guiding principles for the design of new functions into existing enzymes or for the de novo design of new activities in protein scaolds.6 Active site loops, often involved in substrate binding and product release, could also play a relevant role promoting substrate promiscuity. The ability of these loops to adopt dierent conformations with similar free energies could facilitate the binding of dierent substrates, giving an opportunity to promiscuous activities that could be enhanced by protein engineering processes.

Jiang e-mail: jiangling0424@126.com  Introduction  Enzyme promiscuity has attracted signicant attention from chemists and biochemists (Khersonsky and Tawk 2010). Some enzymes have a catalytic pro- miscuity with unnatural substrates. For instance, hydrolases have been used to catalyze carboncarbon bond formation reactions such as aldol condensations (Chen et al. 2013), Mannich reactions (Xue et al. 2012), Michael additions (Strohmeier et al. 2009) and Henry reactions (Wang et al. 2010).  Carboncarbon bond formation plays an important role in organic synthesis. Among the different carbon carbon formation reactions, the BaylisHillman reac- tion, which is a reaction between an aldehyde and an activated alkene derivative resulting in the formation of a carbon-to-carbon bond (see Fig. 1), has received growing interest (Basavaiah and Veeraraghavaiah 2012). The BaylisHillman reaction is typically catalyzed by organocatalysts such as 1,4-diazabicy- clo[2.2.2]octane, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, and Lewis acids. Generally, these catalysts suffer from toxicity, high price, and lack of biodegradation. Reetz et al. (2007) found that the BaylisHillman reaction could be catalyzed by various proteins such as serum albumins or certain lipases. Lopez-Iglesias et al. (2011) used a protease from Bacillus licheniformis to catalyze the BaylisHillman reaction between p- nitrobenzaldehyde and methyl vinyl ketone. However, there are drawbacks to both methods that need to be overcome, such as the narrow substrate scope and limitations to industrial applications with the addition of water. Recently, Bjelic et al. (2013) designed enone-binding enzymes with catalytic activity for the MoritaBaylisHillman reaction by computational analysis. Generally, enzymatic catalysis provides a new strategy for producing useful ne chemicals, takes place under mild conditions without the use of toxic chemical reagents, giving a more eco-friendly process than conventional chemical catalysis. There- fore, the development of a new enzymatic Baylis Hillman reaction is still in great demand.  Herein, we found that Escherichia coli BioH esterase, which is involved in the synthesis of biotin, also possesses sufcient catalytic promiscuity to catalyze the BaylisHillman reaction over a wide range of substrates in organic solvents (Fig. 1). The esterase can be easily over-expressed in E. coli and be applied without further purication (Tang et al. 2011). Therefore, we believe this low-cost and organic solvent-tolerant enzyme has the potential to actualize green BaylisHillman reactions in industry.  Materials and methods  Materials  Amano Lipase AK from Pseudomonas uorescens (C20,000 U/g), Amano Lipase AS from Aspergillus niger (12,00015,000 U/g), Amano Lipase AYS from Candida rugosa (C30,000 U/g), Amano Lipase DF from Rhizopus oryzae (C30,000 U/g), and Amano Lipase PS from Burkholderia cepacia (C30,000 U/g) were purchased from Amano Enzyme Inc. Lipase from C. rugosa (C700 U/mg) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lipozyme RMIM from Rhizomucor miehei (407 U/g) and Lipozyme TLIM from Ther- momyces lanuginosus (356 U/g) were purchased from Beijing Gaoruisen Technology Co., Ltd. Lipase from R. miehei (250 U/mg) and esterase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RspE) (200 U/mg) were expressed in E. coli (Wang et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2013). BioH esterase was expressed in E. coli and applied without further purication (Supporting Information, page 1, para- graph 2). Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purication.    General procedure of the BaylisHillman reaction  The reaction mixture comprised of aldehyde (0.5 mmol), methyl vinyl ketone (0.5 mmol), BioH esterase powder (150 mg) and acetonitrile (5 ml). It was shaken at 200 rpm at 30 C for specied time (formation of products was determined by TLC). After the reaction proceeded to completion, the enzyme was removed by ltration (Whatman qualitative medium- ow lter paper, pore size 11 lm). The ltrate was washed by water (5 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 9 5 ml). The organic phases were com- bined and evaporated in vacuum. The crude product was puried by silica gel column chromatography and eluted with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (6:1, v/v). Product-contained fractions were combined, concen- trated, and dried.  Analytical methods  Reactions were monitored by TLC with GF254 silica gel plates with a mobile phase of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (3/1, v/v). The structure of the BaylisHillman adducts were conrmed by 1H NMR (Bruker Advance 2B 400 MHz) using CDCl3 as solvent. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm relative to the internal standard of tetramethylsilane. The coupling constants (J) are given in Hz. All the known products were character- ized by comparing the 1H NMR with those reported in the literature.

A wide range of enzymes were investigated in order to choose a suitable biocatalyst (Table 1). In the absence of the enzyme, no conversion was observed. Not all proteins could catalyze the Baylis Hillman reactions effectively, as evidenced by Lipase AK, Lipase AS, Lipase AYS, and Lipase DF, that only produced trace amounts of products. When the reaction was run with the lipases from C. rugosa and R. miehei and with Lipozyme RMIM and Lipozyme TLIM, the reaction proceeded slowly and the yields were \10 %. Esterase from R. sphaeroides (RspE) showed acceptable catalytic activity and had a yield of 24 %. The highest yield was achieved by using E. coli BioH esterase. A reaction catalyzed by denatured BioH was also conducted: the yield was only 12.3 %. These results indicated that the special spatial confor- mation of the BioH esterase is responsible for the BaylisHillman reaction.  Optimization of enzymatic reaction conditions  Next, the reaction medium was optimized (see Fig. 2). When the reaction was conducted under solvent-free conditions, the yield was only 3 %. Solvents with different log p values (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, toluene, cyclohexane and hexane were tested) the yields were 5, 10, 5.1, and 6.1 %, respectively. For N,N-dimeth- ylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, the yields were improved to 22.3 and 37.4 %, respectively. The best results were obtained by using acetonitrile as solvent, with a yield of 46.1 %. Thus, acetonitrile was chosen as the medium for further investigation.   Effect of different substrates on the Baylis Hillman reaction  Under the optimized conditions (see Fig. 1 for details), other aldehydes and a, b-unsaturated carbonyl com- pounds were used in the reaction (see Table 2). Although only aldehydes with a strong electron-with- drawing group, such as a nitro group or cyano group, could take part in the reaction, activated alkenes had an extensive scope. In the case of aryl aldehydes, the substituent position played an important role in the reaction. A substituent in the para-position led to a higher yield, while a substituent in the ortho and meta- positions gave the BaylisHillman adducts in slightly lower yields and resulted in longer reaction times. Generally, longer reaction times were required, and lower yields of BaylisHillman adducts were obtained with using acrylate compared to methyl vinyl ketone, which was most likely due to steric hinderance. To our disappointment, several other activated alkenes, such as acrylonitrile and acrylamide, did not produce their corresponding products (data not shown). Although various reaction conditions were investigated to improve the ee value of the products, no enantioselec- tivity could be observed at this time.  Identication of reaction products  All products were conrmed by NMR and the data are provided as Supplementary Information. Figure 3 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of 3-[hydroxyl-(4- nitrophenyl)-methyl]-but-3-en-2-one. The presence of signals in A (8.2 ppm, triple, J = 10.6 Hz, 2H) and B (7.55 ppm, multiple, 2H) conrmed the corre- sponding proton in the phenyl group. The signals in C (6.29 ppm, double, J = 6.8 Hz, 1H) and D (6.04 ppm, triple, J = 15.4 Hz, 1H) conrmed the corresponding proton of olenic. Signals E (5.68 ppm, single, 1H) and F (3.46 ppm, multiple, 1H) appeared and con- rmed that aldehyde group of p-nitrobenzaldehyde had reacted with methyl vinyl ketone to form a new carboncarbon bond, The presence of signal E (5.68 ppm, single, 1H) conrmed the corresponding proton of allylic and the presence of signal F indicated the proton of hydroxyl. The signal G (2.36 ppm, 3H) indicated the proton of methyl.  Conclusions  Investigations on enzyme promiscuity can potentially expand the application of biocatalysts. Here we describe a novel E. coli BioH esterase-catalyzed BaylisHillman reaction with moderate yields and wide substrate scope. In addition, as the enzyme can be prepared by large-scale fermentation at a low cost, the protocol has a potential for industrial applications. Further studies on improving its activity and enanti- oselectivity by enzyme evolution are still in progress.

"10.1021/bi201581b"	" Rapid Report  pubs.acs.org/biochemistry  Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis without the Lipids: Recognition Promiscuity of Escherichia coli Heptosyltransferase I Daniel J. Czyzyk, Cassie Liu, and Erika A. Taylor*  Department of Chemistry, Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut 06459, United States  * S Supporting Information  ABSTRACT: Heptosyltransferase I (HepI) is responsible for the transfer of L-glycero-D-manno-heptose to a 3-deoxy- -D-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Kdo) of the growing core region of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The catalytic efficiency of HepI with the fully deacylated analogue of Escherichia coli HepI LipidA is 12-fold greater than with the fully acylated substrate, with a kcat/Km of 2.7  106 M1 s1, compared to a value of 2.2  105 M1 s1 for the Kdo2- LipidA substrate. Not only is this is the first demonstration that an LPS biosynthetic enzyme is catalytically enhanced by the absence of lipids, this result has significant implica- tions for downstream enzymes that are now thought to utilize deacylated substrates.   The effectiveness of antibiotics for the treatment of Gram- negative infections is hampered by their uptake into cells, because of the presence of an outer membrane containing a high level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS).1 LPS on cell surfaces is important for cell motility, intestinal colonization and bacterial biofilm formation, and contributes substantively to antibiotic resistance.1,2 These characteristics have spurred research toward the development of inhibitors for the LPS biosynthetic enzymes. The structure of the LPS is comprised of three parts: LipidA, core oligosaccharide (Core-OS), and repeating O-Antigen. Heptosyltransferase I (HepI) catalyzes the first step in the LPS synthesis pathway following lipid functionalization of LipidA.3,4 Blocking LPS biosynthesis prior to the addition of an L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (Hep) residue results in increased bacterial sensitivity to hydrophobic antibiotics and phagocytosis by macrophages; thus, HepI is considered an excellent target for inhibitor development.5 In our efforts to determine the enzyme mechanism for drug design, we have found that HepI can efficiently utilize multiple LipidA analogues as substrates, including a completely lipid free LipidA molecule. This is the first enzyme in the LPS biosynthetic pathway that does not have strict selectivity for acylated substrates.3 Furthermore, this finding has important implications for the substrate selectivity of downstream enzymes, which are now thought also to utilize deacylated substrates.  HepI is essential for the transfer of the first Hep moiety in the core oligosaccharide of LPS. It catalyzes formation of an (15) linkage between L-glycero-D-manno-heptose and the first 3-deoxy--D-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Kdo) covalently attached to LipidA (Scheme 1).5 A crystal structure of Escherichia coli HepI bound to a donor substrate analogue, ADP-2-deoxy-2-fluoroheptose, reveals binding interactions between ADP-Hep and the sugar donor domain; however, these structures revealed little about interactions of HepI with the acceptor substrate Kdo2-LipidA.6 Our goal was to identify a substrate analogue that would be amenable to crystallography, thereby allowing the residues that confer sugar acceptor specificity to be revealed, while also attempting to identify tighter binding molecules that lead toward the development of HepI inhibitors.   Deacylation of the LipidA molecules was investigated to improve the solubility of the acceptor substrate, thereby potentially removing the need for detergent, while also removing potential entropic penalties associated with binding. Additionally, because the Kdo2-LipidA molecule is believed to be bound in the membrane during catalysis, we hypothesized that these residues would be relatively unimportant for con- ferring specificity. Here we report the effect of the acylation state, as well as the number of Kdo molecules, has on Km for the acceptor substrate. Kdo2-LipidA (Figure 1A) was isolated from E. coli HepI knockout strain WBB06 according to published protocols,7 and Kdo-LipidA (Figure 1B, also known as Re-LipidA) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Kdo2-LipidA was O-deacylated by reaction with anhydrous hydrazine. The fully deacylated acceptor molecule (Figure 1D), which was previously synthesized by Brabetz and coworkers,4 was synthesized using a modified method analogous to that used by Bystrova and coworkers.8 First, the O-deacylated Kdo2- LipidA (Figure 1C) was made via reaction with anhydrous hydrazine and then the fully deacylated acceptor resulted from subsequent refluxing with 4 M NaOH.  Using a coupled assay containing pyruvate kinase and L-lactate dehydrogenase, HepI activity was determined through UVvis monitoring of production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide at 340 nm.6,9 All four LipidA analogues (Figure 1AD) were found to be competent substrates when the assay was conducted with or without Triton X-100 (Table 1). For- mation of the pentasaccharide (Scheme 1) derived from use of the fully deacylated LipidA analogue (Figure 1D) was con- firmed by ESI-MS (see the Supporting Information). A roughly 5-fold decrease in the rate of turnover was observed between the fully acylated acceptor substrates and the deacylated forms of Kdo2-LipidA, with similar rates observed for both the O-deacylated and fully deacylated LipidA analogues. This decrease in kcat is more than offset by an increased binding affinity, causing the overall catalytic efficiency to be 4-fold greater for the fully deacylated Kdo2-LipidA than for the fully acylated LipidA (kcat/Km values of 2.1  106 and 5.2  105 M1 s1, respectively) in the presence of Triton X-100 and 12-fold greater (kcat/Km values of 2.7  106 and 2.2  105 M1 s1, respectively) in the absence of detergent.   Furthermore, the <2-fold binding affinity discrimination between Kdo-LipidA and Kdo2-LipidA can be rationalized because in vivo it has been demonstrated that the E. coli Kdo transferase (EcKdtA) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes incorporation of both Kdo units. Because a single incorporation of Kdo is only observed using isolated EcKdtA with limiting quantities of its sugar donor, cytosine monophosphate-Kdo,10 HepI would only encounter Kdo2-LipidA in vivo, thereby eliminating any driving force for selectivity between Kdo-LipidA and Kdo2-LipidA.  Figure 1. Structures of LipidA acceptor substrates: (A) E. coli Kdo2- LipidA, (B) Salmonella minnesota Kdo-LipidA, (C) O-deacylated E. coli Kdo2-LipidA, and (D) fully deacylated E. coli Kdo2-LipidA. The Kdo that acts as a nucleophile for the glysyltransferase reaction is colored red.  Tighter binding of the fully deacylated acceptor analogue, when compared to the acylated acceptors, is enhanced further in the absence of detergent. We hypothesize that when the acyl chains are contained within a detergent micelle, they are isolated from the enzyme, but when free in solution (in the absence of detergent), they make destabilizing interactions with the protein surface or aggregate together. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that HepI aggregates in the presence of Triton X-100, the fully acylated Kdo2-LipidA, and the combination, whereas apo HepI and HepI bound to the fully deacylated LipidA do not show significant aggregation when analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). Furthermore, the observation that the fully deacylated acceptor has a higher affinity in the absence of detergent, and the opposite is true for the O-deacylated LipidA analogue, provides further support for our hypothesis. Because the acyl portion of the LipidA acceptor resides in the inner leaflet of the inner membrane when the reaction occurs in vivo, we speculate that the enzyme only recognizes the sugar region of these acceptor molecules for catalysis. This is the first report of enzymatic activity for HepI in the absence of detergent, suggesting that perhaps the sensitivity of the coupled assay for determining initial rates is also an improvement over traditional thin layer chromatography analysis of radioisotope incorpo- ration for LPS elongation.11    The small differences in kinetic parameters among these four substrates suggest that the sugar binding interactions of the acceptor substrate predominate for HepI. Our findings are consistent with a prior report that Kdo2-LipidIVA (a tetraactylated LipidA analogue that is biosynthetically up- stream of HepI) can be adventitiously turned over by HepI and has an apparent Km of 4.5 M.11 The ability of HepI not only to utilize an underacylated LipidA analogue but also to have improved catalytic efficiency in the absence of any lipids has broad implications for enzymes that utilize glycolipid substrates, and especially other enzymes of the LPS biosynthetic pathway.  Furthermore, our finding that fully deacylated Kdo2-LipidA is a better substrate for the enzyme than the native substrate, and that it binds without inducing aggregation, should open up new strategies for structural analysis of the proteinsubstrate interactions of this and related glycolipid-modifying enzymes. The ability of this enzyme to utilize multiple LipidA analogues suggests that examination of the glycosyltransferases involved in LPS biosynthesis, including HepI, could yield answers that are broadly applicable to questions concerning substrate selectivity in glycosyltransferases in general. We anticipate that these results will ultimately enhance lead discovery in the area of inhibition of LPS biosynthesis for treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections.

"10.1038/nCHeMBIO.2263"	" puBLIsHed OnLIne: 19 deCeMBer 2016 | dOI: 10.1038/nCHeMBIO.2263  article  Molecular insights into the enzyme promiscuity of an aromatic prenyltransferase  ridao Chen1,7, Bingquan Gao2,3,7, Xiao Liu1,6,7, Feiying ruan1, Yong Zhang4, Jizhong Lou4, Keping Feng1,  Carsten Wunsch5, shu-Ming Li5, Jungui dai1* & Fei sun2,3*  Aromatic prenyltransferases (aPTases) transfer prenyl moieties from isoprenoid donors to various aromatic acceptors, some of  which have the rare property of extreme enzymatic promiscuity toward both a variety of prenyl donors and a large diversity of  acceptors. In this study, we discovered a new aPTase, AtaPT, from Aspergillus terreus that exhibits unprecedented promiscuity  toward diverse aromatic acceptors and prenyl donors and also yields products with a range of prenylation patterns. Systematic  crystallographic studies revealed various discrete conformations for ligand binding with donor-dependent acceptor specificity  and multiple binding sites within a spacious hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket. Further structure-guided mutagenesis of  active sites at the substrate-binding pocket is responsible for altering the specificity and promiscuity toward substrates and   the diversity of product prenylations. Our study reveals the molecular mechanism underlying the promiscuity of AtaPT and   suggests an efficient protein engineering strategy to generate new prenylated derivatives in drug discovery applications.   The  transfer  of  prenyl  moieties,  as  mediated  by  aPTases,  is  a  ubiquitous reaction in the biosynthesis of both primary and  secondary  metabolites  in  plants,  bacteria  and  fungi14.  The  prenylation  of  aromatic  compounds  and  a  variety  of  subsequent   tailoring reactions, including oxidation, reduction and cyclization,  give rise to a plethora of hybrid natural products that exhibit diverse  biological  properties.  In  particular,  the  introduction  of  prenyl   moieties  often  increases  the  lipophilicity  of  these  compounds,  enhancing their interactions  with  biological  membranes5.  Modification  of  drug-like  natural  products  via  one-step  prenyla- tion is seen as a convenient approach for the synthesis of bioactive   compounds  in  drug  discovery  programs.  However,  the  present  lack of a widely applicable method for the prenylation of diverse   aromatic scaffolds remains a challenge6.    The aPTases involved in secondary metabolism have attracted  considerable  attention  in  recent  years.  Examples  include  the  dis- covery  of  soluble  ABBA-type  and  dimethylallyltryptophan  syn- thase (DMATS)-type aPTases from bacteria7,8 and fungi912 as well  as  the  characterization  of  membrane-bound  aPTases4,13.  These  aPTases  catalyze  prenylations  by  forming  CC,  CO  or  CN  bonds via electrophilic alkylation8. The ABBA-type aPTase NphB14  can  catalyze  the  prenylation  of  several  aromatic  compounds  (for  example,  hydroxynaphthalenes,  flavonoids  and  polyketides)  via  a  Mg2+-dependent mechanism. The DMATS-type aPTases, AnaPT15,  BrePT16, 7-DMATS17 and CdpNPT18, can catalyze the prenylation  of  tryptophan-containing  cyclic  dipeptides,  hydroxynaphthalenes  or  flavonoids  via  a  Mg2+-independent  mechanism.  The  aPTases  characterized  to  date  have  typically  exhibited  a  strict  specificity   for  their  prenyl  donors  but  have  had  relative  diversity  in  their   aromatic  acceptors.  However,  BAE61387,  TleC  and  MpnD  can  accept  various  prenyl  donors  with  differing  chain  lengths10,19,20.  Even though these enzymatic properties are chemically and biologi- cally intriguing, the limited number of available crystal structures,   particularly  the  lack  of  structures  of  these  enzymes  in  complex   with  diverse  donors  and/or  acceptors,  have  hampered  the  efforts   to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying the promiscu- ity of aPTases.  In  the  present  work,  we  identified  and  functionally  character- ized the aPTase gene AtaPT (A. terreus aromatic prenyltransferase)  from an A. terreus strain21. Unlike any of the previously character- ized  aPTases,  AtaPT  showed  unprecedented  substrate  promiscu- ity,  both  for  aromatic  acceptors  and  for  prenyl  donors  (C5C20),  including dimethylallyl, geranyl, farnesyl, geranylgeranyl and phytyl  pyrophosphates (DMAPP, GPP, FPP, GGPP and PPP, respectively).   In  addition,  the  prenylation  catalyzed  by  AtaPT  also  had  the   ability to form mono-, di- and/or triprenylated products with CC  and/or CO bonds. Systematic structural and functional investiga- tions revealed the structural basis of AtaPTs substrate promiscu- ity.  Moreover,  structure-guided  mutagenesis  yielded  new  enzyme  mutants with tuned catalytic specificities.  RESULTS The unprecedented substrate tolerance of AtaPT We  cloned  the  AtaPT  gene  from  A.  terreus  A8-4  via  RT-PCR22  (Supplementary  Results,  Supplementary  Tables  1  and  2).  The  protein  putatively  encoded  by  AtaPT  has  a  length  of  424  amino  acids and a theoretical molecular weight of 47.5 kDa. AtaPT shares  high sequence identity with the EAU34068 protein from A. terreus  NIH2624 (Supplementary Table 1), differing at only three residues,  including  290  (threonine  in  AtaPT  versus  lysine  in  EAU34068),  292  (alanine  versus  glutamic  acid)  and  373  (asparagine  versus   serine). Additionally, AtaPT shares 42% and 29% sequence identity  with AnaPT and FgaPT2 (ref. 23), respectively. Further sequence  analysis indicated that AtaPT belongs to the DMATS superfamily   and  has  close  evolutionary  relationships  with  aPTases  from   fungi (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Initial  incubation  with a range of routinely tested candidate substrates (for example,  tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides, hydroxynaphthalenes and  flavonoids as acceptors) and with DMAPP as the prenyl donor in  the absence of divalent metal ions revealed the exceptionally relaxed  substrate specificity of AtaPT.  We  next  used  a  panel  of  106  drug-like  aromatics  as  potential  acceptors  and  used  DMAPP,  GPP  and  FPP  as  prenyl  donors  to  extensively investigate the substrate promiscuity of AtaPT (Fig. 1  and Supplementary Fig. 2). HPLCdiode array detection (DAD) MS  analyses  of  reaction  products  revealed  substantial  substrate   promiscuity  of  AtaPT  for  both  the  acceptors  and  donors.  AtaPT  can  catalyze  the  prenylations  of  72  aromatic  compounds  with  all  three different prenyl donors. Included among the accepted com- pounds were many drug-like natural products, including lignanoids   (1 and 2), tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides (3 and 4), quino- line alkaloids (5 and 6), xanthones (712), benzophenones (1318),   flavonoid  aglycons  and  glycosides  (1937,  40),  a  phenylethyl  chromone (38), a curcuminoid (39), a stilbene (41), coumarins (42  and 43), hydroxynaphthalenes (44 and 45) and 4-hydroxybenzalde- hyde (46). Furthermore, we found that the initial monoprenylated  products were subsequently accepted by AtaPT as new substrates  for further reactions that formed di- and/or triprenylated products  with both C-prenylation and O-prenylation, thus providing further  evidence of the extreme degree of substrate promiscuity of AtaPT  (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note).  To  investigate  the  prenyl  donor  promiscuity  of  AtaPT,  we  incubated  (+)-butyrolactone  II  (1)  with  GGPP  or  PPP.  Notably,  HPLCMS analyses revealed that AtaPT can use these substrates  to produce a series of geranylgeranylated and phytylated products  (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). To the best of our knowledge, AtaPT  is the first aPTase shown to be able to catalyze prenylations of lig- nanoids, quinoline alkaloids, benzophenones, flavonoid glycosides  and curcuminioids while accepting various types of prenyl donors.    It  should  be  noted  that  our  subsequent  genetic  studies  showed  that AtaPT was not the aPTase gene involved in the biosynthesis  of  antitumor  metabolite  (+)-butyrolactone  I  (47a)24  in  A.  terreus  (Supplementary Fig. 6), a finding consistent with a recent report25.  AtaPT is capable of promiscuous prenylation In  addition  to  substrate  promiscuity,  we  also  investigated  the   promiscuous  prenylation  capacity  of  AtaPT.  On  the  basis  of  the  results  of  the  initial  exploratory  assays,  we  selected  nine  drug- like  scaffolds  with  complex  structures,  including  1,  ()-cyclo- L-Trp-L-Trp  (3),  9-aminocamptothecin  (5),  norathyriol  (11),  4,4-dihydroxybenzophenone  (13),  genistein  (21),  sophoricoside  (22), resveratrol (41) and 7-hydroxycoumarin (42), to use in prepara- tive-scale reactions and to measure enzyme kinetics (Supplementary  Table 3). In total, we obtained and determined the structures of 42  mono-, di- and/or triprenylated products, with a diversity of both  C-  and/or  O-prenylations  at  differing  positions,  using  high-reso- lution MS and NMR analyses (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 7 and  Supplementary Note). The prenylated products included 35 new  compounds  and  seven  previously  reported  bioactive  compounds,  47a, 50a, 50b, 51a, 51b, 58a and 59a. We performed in vitro bio- activity assays with all of these compounds. For instance, we found  that prenylated products with dimethylallyl or geranyl substitutions  (50a50c  and  51a51d)  of  the  anticancer  agent  21  (refs.  26,27)  exhibited  stronger  antiproliferation  effects  against  three  human  cancer cell lines (HCT-8, Bel7402 and BGC823) and had reduced  half-maximal  inhibitory  concentration  (IC50)  values  compared  to  21 when assessed using an MTT assay method28 (Supplementary  Table 4). This result suggested that these prenylated products might  be promising anticancer leads in the future.

It is typically thought that prenylation reactions catalyzed by the  aPTases have a regioselective preference at the ortho position to the  electron-donating hydroxyl group of an aromatic ring, a scenario  that follows the FriedelCrafts rule. However, for the prenylations  catalyzed  by  AtaPT,  we  observed  unusual  prenylation  patterns  at  various  electron-negative,  atypical  positions  of  aromatic  rings  (Supplementary Fig. 7). When using 5 as the substrate and GPP as  the prenyl donor, the prenyl group was introduced to the ortho and/or  para position relative to an amino moiety to produce 10-geranyl-9- aminocamptothecin (54a), 12-geranyl-9-aminocamptothecin (54b)  and  10,12-digeranyl-9-aminocamptothecin  (54c).  Additionally,  when using 42 and GPP, the prenylations occurred at both the ortho  position to the carbonyl group (C3) and the ortho position to the  phenolic hydroxyl moiety (C6), yielding the diprenylated product  3,6-digeranyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (59b). To the best of our knowl- edge, this is the first report on prenylation at the para position to  an amino moiety and the ortho position to a carbonyl group by an  aPTase. These highly diverse catalytic outcomes are representative  of the multitudinous enzymatic promiscuity of AtaPT.  Structural characterization of AtaPT To  explore  the  molecular  mechanism  (or  mechanisms)  underly- ing the promiscuity of AtaPT, we solved its 3D molecular structure   using crystallography. To obtain high-quality crystals, the first ten  residues at the N terminus, which had been computationally pre- dicted to be disordered, were truncated, yielding a new recombi- nant  protein,  AtaPT11424,  that  had  the  same  catalytic  activities  as   the full-length protein. Hereafter, without explicit statement indi- cating  otherwise,  AtaPT11424  is  referred  to  as  AtaPT.  The  crystal  structure  of  AtaPT  was  solved  to  1.90-  resolution  via  molecu- lar  replacement  using  the  structure  of  FgaPT2  (ref.  23;  Protein   Data Bank (PDB) code 3I4Z) as the initial model (Supplementary  Table 5). All of the residues, excepting those from K309 to A320  (inclusive),  were  clearly  traced  and  assigned  according  to  clear   electron density information.  As a member of the DMATS superfamily, AtaPT shares a com- mon  aPTase  fold  comprising  five  consecutive    units  with  a  catalytic chamber at the center (Fig. 3a). Comparing the structure  of AtaPT with the previously reported structures of DMATS-type  aPTases, AnaPT29 (PDB code 4LD7), FgaPT2, FtmPT1 (ref. 30; PDB  code 3O24) and CdpNPT18 (PDB code 4E0T), the corresponding  structural r.m.s. deviation of C atoms are 1.08 , 1.63 , 1.57   and 1.72 , respectively.

Right, bottom view of the electrostatic surface  of Atapt showing the hydrophobic environment of the catalytic chamber for aromatic substrate binding. (c) the catalytic chamber of Atapt coordinated  with key residues, which are divided into three regions: the prenyl donor binding pocket (top), the tyrosine shield (middle) and the aromatic acceptor  binding pocket (bottom).  Using  information  from  previous  structural  studies7,23,30,  we  were able to identify the highly positively charged end of the AtaPT  catalytic chamber for prenyl donor binding, the hydrophobic end  of the chamber for aromatic acceptor binding (Fig. 3b) and addi- tional active sites of the reaction chamber (Fig. 3c). The reaction  chamber can be divided into three regions: the top prenyl donor  binding pocket, which is composed of basic residues (K95, R104,  K188, R264 and K266) with positive charges and three polar resi- dues  (N328,  Q342  and  N411),  interacts  with  the  -phosphate  of  the prenyl donor by negating the negative charges23,30; the middle  tyrosine shield, which is composed of four tyrosines (Y190, Y268,  Y344  and  Y413),  interacts  with  the  -phosphate  of  the  prenyl   donor  and  is  responsible  for  stabilizing  the  nascent  carbocation  intermediate during catalysis23,30; and the bottom aromatic accep- tor  binding  pocket,  which  is  mainly  composed  of  hydrophobic  residues, including L252, L249, L323, F272, W397, A270, L204 and  L194 (Fig. 3c).  We also noted that there are two AtaPT molecules in the asym- metric  unit  of  the  crystal,  and  the  area  of  the  buried  interface  between them is 4,500 2. The overall solvent accessible surface  area  of  one  monomer  is  15,400  2  (Supplementary  Fig.  8a),   suggesting  a  strong  interaction  between  two  monomers.  Further  quantitative  analysis  using  PISA31  suggested  a  tetramer  form  of  AtaPT  (Supplementary  Fig.  8b),  a  supposition  consistent  with  our previous data, which were collected using size-exclusion chro- matography with multi-angle light scattering (SECMALS) in the  aqueous phase22. The interfaces of AtaPT within the tetramer are  mainly  composed  of  charged  residues  (Supplementary  Fig.  8a).   Structural  analysis  suggested  that  the  oligomerization  of  AtaPT  does  not  restrict  the  substrate  access  to  the  binding  pocket  (Supplementary  Fig.  8b)  and  might  not  affect  the  enzymatic   activity  of  AtaPT.  However,  a  potential  allosteric  and  synergetic  effect might exist within the tetramer.  The spacious hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket To  explore  the  structural  basis  of  the  enzymatic  promiscuity  of  AtaPT, we mapped the sequence conservation of other DMATS-type  aPTases, including AnaPT, FgaPT2, FtmPT1 and CdpNPT, onto the  structure of AtaPT (Supplementary Figs. 8c,d and 9). The prenyl  donor binding pocket and the tyrosine shield in all of these aPTases  are highly conserved; the aromatic acceptor binding pocket is less  conserved.  Comparison  of  the  aromatic  acceptor-binding  pocket  of  AtaPT  with  those  of  the  other  DMATS-type  aPTases  revealed  that AtaPT has a uniquely spacious hydrophobic substrate-binding  pocket (Supplementary Fig. 10ae), having both the largest solvent  accessible surface area and the greatest overall volume among all of  the proteins examined (Supplementary Table 6).  The aromatic acceptor-binding pocket of AtaPT is surrounded  mainly  by  hydrophobic  residues  with  relatively  short  side  chains  compared with the other DMATS-type aPTases. For instance, the  residues forming the pocket of AnaPT include F103, Q192, F212  and  F265  (Supplementary  Fig.  10b),  whereas  the  corresponding  residues at the equivalent positions of AtaPT are L83, N172, S192  and G251 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). In another example, the resi- dues forming the pocket of FgaPT2 include T102, Y191 and M328  and the positively charged resides K174 and R244 (Supplementary  Fig. 10c), whereas the corresponding residues at the equivalent posi- tions of AtaPT are all small and hydrophobic (G106, S192, G326,  C175 and G251) (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Similar observations  were  also  noted  when  comparing  the  structures  of  FtmPT1  and  CdpNPT with that of AtaPT (Supplementary Fig. 10d,e). We also  examined the electron density map of the high-resolution structure  of AtaPT and observed only two water molecules inside its aromatic  acceptor-binding pocket, reflecting its highly hydrophobic nature. The spacious substrate-binding pocket of AtaPT provides addi- tional  flexibility  to  accommodate  various  donors  and  acceptors,  and the hydrophobic nature of the pocket can probably increase the  stability of prenyl carbocation intermediates, thereby increasing the  possibility of prenylation at multiple positions.  Donor-dependent specificity with conformational changes To  further  reveal  the  molecular  mechanism  underlying  the  pro- miscuity of AtaPT, we determined the crystal structures of AtaPT  bound  with  various  donors  and/or  acceptors.  To  obtain  a  stable  complex with substrates, we used the nonhydrolyzable prenyl donors  DMSPP  (dimethylallyl  S-thiolodiphosphate)  and  GSPP  (geranyl S-thiolodiphosphate) instead of DMAPP and GPP. Eventually, we  obtained the structures of binary complexes bound with DMSPP  and GSPP as well as the structures of ternary complexes bound with  GSPP1  (DBu),  DMSPP2  (LBu)  and  DMSPP21  (Gen)  (Fig.  1;  Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 5).  a  b  E91  R396  W397  H88  GSPP  DBu  R396  Loop 1  E91  W397  H88  Loop 1  H88  GSPP  DBu  During the cocrystallization experiments, we found that, with- out donors, we were not able to obtain binary complexes between  AtaPT and acceptors, suggesting that there is a sequential substrate  binding  mechanism  for  AtaPT.  We  selected  GSPPDBu  as  the   substrate  to  explore  in  detail  in  our  attempt  to  characterize  the  donor-dependent acceptor binding of AtaPT. In the complex struc- ture of AtaPTGSPPDBu, both GSPP and DBu are clearly resolved  in  our  2.3-  electron  density  map  (Fig.  4a).  DBu  is  specifically  coordinated via hydrogen bonds with E91, H88, R396 and W397.  We  noted  a  strong  hydrophobic  interaction  between  the  prenyl   tail of GSPP and DBu, suggesting the contribution of GSPP in the  binding of DBu with AtaPT.  To  further  understand  the  role  of  GSPP  in  the  interaction  between DBu and AtaPT, we sought to measure the binding affin- ity of DBu to AtaPT by using an isothermal titration calorimetry  (ITC) approach. Notably, we found that without GSPP, the titration  of DBu into the AtaPT protein solution did not produce substantial  heat, suggesting that there is no interaction between DBu and AtaPT  (Supplementary Fig. 12a). However, in the presence of GSPP, sig- nificant heat was produced during the titration, indicating a strong  interaction  between  DBu  and  AtaPT,  with  a  measured  binding  affinity of 0.96  0.05 M (Supplementary Fig. 12b,c). Thus, both  the crystallographic results and the ITC results indicated a sequen- tial manner for the binding of AtaPT to the donor GSPP and the  acceptor  DBu.  Furthermore,  in  the  presence  of  DMAPP,  AtaPT  hardly catalyzed the prenylation of DBu, (Supplementary Fig. 3a);  however, with GPP and FPP, the catalytic efficiency was increased  substantially (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3b). The KM of DBu  bound to AtaPT in the presence of DMAPP was determined to be  313 M, which is significantly greater than the value determined  when GPP was the prenyl donor (89 M; Supplementary Table 3).  Together, the crystallographic, ITC and enzymatic assay results sup- port the conclusion that the acceptance of DBu as a substrate by  AtaPT is dependent on the structure of the prenyl donor.  We superimposed the structure of AtaPTGSPPDBu with the  apo structure and found that, following binding with DBu, AtaPT  underwent a marked conformational change at the loop 1 region  located  within  the  first  repetitive    motif  (Fig.  4b).  Residue  H88  shifted  6.1    to  interact  with  DBu,  forming  a  hydrogen   bond.  Such  substantial  conformational  changes  have  not  been   previously reported.  Various conformations and multiple acceptor-binding sites In  addition  to  observing  donor-dependent  acceptor  binding,  we  further compared the apo structure with the complex structures at  the substrate-binding pocket. First, we observed diverse conforma- tional fluctuations of the tyrosine shield region, especially residues  Y190 and Y268, at different substrate binding states (Fig. 5). We  observed two conformations each for Y190 and Y268; we defined  one such state as the open state and the other as the closed state.  In the apo structure, both Y190 and Y268 were in the closed state  (Fig. 5a). After binding with GSPP, the states of these two tyrosines  did not change (Fig. 5b); however, following further binding with  DBu, both Y190 and Y268 were in the open state (Fig. 5c). These  conformational changes for Y190 and Y268 from the closed to the  open state allow enough additional space to accommodate the bind- ing of DBu. When using DMSPP as the prenyl donor, however, we  observed that Y190 and Y268 each showed both the closed and the  open states in the same crystal with equal occupancies (Fig. 5d).  This type of conformational flexibility was reduced during binding  with the acceptors LBu (Fig. 5e) and Gen (Fig. 5f).  Figure 4 | Donor-dependent acceptor binding by AtaPT.

(b) Superposition of the complex structure of AtaptGSppdbu (green)  onto the apo structure of Atapt (cyan). the dynamic loop 1 is indicated  with the large displacement of H88.  We  next  performed  molecular  dynamics simulations  (Supplementary  Fig.  13a)  to  investigate  whether  the  multiple  conformations  of  the  tyrosine  shield  were  induced  by  substrate  binding  or  by  spontaneous  structural  fluctuations  of  AtaPT  itself.  We  observed  that  two  regions,  G68H88  and  K309P324,  showed  substantial  structural  fluctuations  during  the  simulations  (Supplementary  Fig.  13b).  This  observation  was  consistent  with  the facts that the electron density from K309 to A320 could not be  solved owing to its high mobility and that, in the crystal structure  of AtaPTGSPPDBu, loop 1 (from R71 to G87) became flexible  and could not be modeled owing to a lack of electron density. We  further  investigated  the  fluctuations  of  the  four  tyrosine  residues  of the tyrosine shield and found that Y190, Y268 and Y344 exhib- ited substantial flexibility (Supplementary Fig. 13c) and had two  stable positions, whereas Y413 was less flexible and was stabilized  in one position (Supplementary Fig. 13d). This observation was in  accordance with the above findings, although the conformational  fluctuation of Y344 was not observed from the current crystallo- graphic data. We further performed simulations with the complex  structures  AtaPTDMSPP  and  AtaPTGSPP  (Supplementary   Fig. 13eh). Comparing these with the simulations of the apo state,  we observed a reduced degree of conformational fluctuation follow- ing substrate binding.   a  Y413  b  c  d  Y413  Y190 (CS)  Y268 (CS)  Y413  Y190 (CS)  Y268 (CS)  Y190 (OS)  Y268 (OS)  Y413  Y190  (CS/OS)  Y268  (CS/OS)  e  Y413  f  Y413  Y190  (CS/OS)  Y268 (CS)  Y190 (CS)  Y268 (CS)  AtaPT11424Apo  AtaPT11424 GSPP  AtaPT11424 GSPPDBu  AtaPT11424 DMSPP  AtaPT11424 DMSPPLBu  AtaPT11424 DMSPPGen  Figure 5 | conformational dynamics of the tyrosine shield and various acceptor binding sites of AtaPT.

We next compared the binding sites of acceptors from the struc- tures  of  AtaPTGSPPDBu,  AtaPTDMSPPLBu  and  AtaPT DMSPPGen  (Fig.  5c,e,f  and  Supplementary  Fig.  14)  and  thus  discovered  that  AtaPT  has  multiple  acceptor  binding  sites.  DBu,  LBu  and  Gen  were  bound  at  different  sites  within  the  spacious  hydrophobic pocket. The binding site of DBu consisted of E91, H88,  S177, R396 and W397; that of LBu consisted of G82, N172, V174,  R396 and W397; that of Gen consisted of G82, S170, R396 and Y268  and was surrounded by hydrophobic residues, including I167, E169,  L323, P324 and W397.  Notably, we observed that LBu and Gen were at peripheral sites  relatively far from the prenyl donor-binding site (distances of 6   and 8 , respectively). We speculate that this spacious hydropho- bic pocket is able to effectively protect carbocation intermediates  of prenyl groups during catalysis, increasing the lifetime of these  intermediates and thereby offering a strong opportunity to attack  the prenyl acceptors localized at the peripheral sites to complete the  electrophilic alkylation. It should be noted that we did not observe  the  same  conformational  changes  of  loop  1  that  occurred  in  the  structure  of  AtaPTGSPPDBu  when  we  examined  the  crystal  structures of AtaPTDMSPPLBu or AtaPTDMSPPGen.  The  above  crystallographic  observations  and  molecular  simu- lation  studies  indicate  that  AtaPT  exhibits  multiple  states  with   substantial  fluctuations  at  both  the  loop  1  and  tyrosine  shield  region and has multiple sites for acceptor binding. These properties   suggest likely mechanisms that may explain the enzymatic promis- cuity of AtaPT.  mutagenesis-based alteration of the donor selectivity The  aforementioned  structural  comparisons  revealed  that  the   spacious hydrophobic substrate binding pocket of AtaPT consists   of  many  short  hydrophobic  residues,  and  this  unique  pocket  is   most  likely  responsible  for  AtaPTs  flexibility  in  using  multiple  prenyl donors. To study the key sites controlling donor selectivity,   we  compared  the  complex  structures  of  AtaPTGSPP  with  other  aPTase structures and found that residue G326 in AtaPT contributed  to the enlarged substrate binding pocket (Supplementary Fig. 15a),  whereas the equivalent residue in FgaPT2 (M328), AnaPT (V340),  FtmPT1 (M364) and CdpNPT (M349) protruded into the pocket  and  narrowed  the  cavity,  thereby  preventing  the  tolerance  for  an  extended carbon tail of a prenyl donor compound (Supplementary  Figs.  9  and  15b).  It  is  possible  that  the  presence  of  residues   with shorter hydrophobic side chains in the pocket of AtaPT elimi- nates some or all of the steric barriers that are present in homologs  from  other  species.  Doing  so  may  prevent  the  binding  of  longer   prenyl donors, resulting in AtaPTs broad tolerance for a diversity  of prenyl donors.  To evaluate these suppositions, we performed mutagenesis with  the  aim  of  characterizing  the  contribution  of  G326  to  the  donor  selectivity  of  AtaPT.  The  site-directed  AtaPT  mutant  G326M   was constructed (Supplementary Table 2), and prenylation assays  using 1 as the acceptor showed that G326M could not accept GPP  or  FPP  as  donors.  However,  the  catalytic  activity  for  the  G326M  mutant  with  DMAPP  was  substantially  enhanced  compared  to  that of the wild type (Fig. 6a). Similar results were observed when  using 21 as the acceptor; the only detectable activity of the G326M  mutant enzyme was toward GPP and FPP (Fig. 6b). The conver- sion efficiency from 1 to 47a catalyzed by G326M using DMAPP as  the donor was 32 times higher than that of the wild type, and 47a  became the major product (47b47e; Figs. 2b, 6a). Notably, besides  restricting  the  size  of  the  donor  pocket,  the  G326M  mutation  increased the extent of the hydrophobic interface for the binding  of 1, which might be another factor contributing to the increased  prenylation efficiency for 47a that was observed for the mutant.  Alteration of the prenylation promiscuity via mutagenesis Using  the  crystal  structure  of  AtaPTGSPPDBu,  we  performed  further mutagenesis experiments to study which residues serve as  the determinants of prenylation promiscuity. We selected H88, E91,  S177, R396 and W397, all of which are involved in the interaction  with DBu (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 14a), as the targets for  site-directed mutagenesis. We then assayed the catalytic activities  of the mutants using DBu as the aromatic acceptor and GPP as the  prenyl donor.  The R396A mutant resulted in an inclusion body during expres- sion; thus, we did not investigate this mutant further. The S177A  mutant  showed  no  obvious  differences  in  enzymatic  activity  or  product  diversity  compared  to  the  wild  type.  The  H88A  mutant  showed reduced enzymatic activity but produced a similar diversity  of product compounds. The W397A mutant showed both reduced  enzymatic activity and altered product diversity (Fig. 6d). Notably,  the  conversion  efficiencies  from  1  to  48c  catalyzed  by  both  the  W397A mutant and the wild type were similar (Fig. 6d). It is worth  noting that the position of the prenylation of 1 for 48c is the C4  position (Fig. 2b), which is the closest position relative to the pyro- phosphate end of the prenyl donor GSPP in the complex structure  of AtaPTGSPPDBu (Fig. 6c).  We found that the most interesting position of AtaPT in terms  of  its  acceptor  promiscuity  was  E91.  In  the  complex  structure  of  AtaPTGSPPDBu,  E91  formed  a  hydrogen  bond  with  DBu,   and thus seems to have a role in coordinating the binding of DBu  (Fig.  6c  and  Supplementary  Fig.  14a).  We  were  therefore  able   to predict that a mutation from E91 to D91 would not change the  catalytic activity. Results from our enzyme assays largely confirmed  this  prediction,  although  it  must  be  noted  that  the  distribution   of  the  various  products  was  slightly  different  between  the  E91D  mutant and the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 6d).  However, to our surprise, the E91A and E91Q mutants did not  lose their prenylation catalytic activities at all but rather exhibited  substantial alterations in the diversity of their products (Fig. 6d).  Only monoprenylated products (48b and 48c) could be detected for  these two mutants, and they had high conversion rates. Such nota- ble changes persuaded us to solve the crystal structure of the mutant  E91A  with  DBu  and  GSPP  (Fig.  6e).  As  we  had  hypothesized,   the  complex  structure  of  E91AGSPPDBu  exhibited  substantial  differences compared to that of AtaPTGSPPDBu. There was no  conformational change for loop 1 observed in the mutant structure,  but the binding pocket of DBu was altered to comprise residues L83,  S93, K104, L105, S177, R396 and W397 (Fig. 6e and Supplementary  Fig.  16).  Markedly,  the  orientation  of  bound  DBu  in  the  mutant  structure was rotated 180 degrees, with the C4 position (Fig. 6e)  inserted into the pocket. In the wild-type structure, the C4 position  (Fig. 6c) was inserted into the pocket.  We also measured the prenylation activities of wild-type AtaPT  and  the  H88A,  E91A,  E91Q,  E91D,  S177A  and  W397A  variants   using  21  and  22  as  the  acceptors  and  GPP  as  the  prenyl  donor.  Notably, we found that, similar to reactions with 1 as the acceptor,  the  E91A  and  E91Q  mutants  exhibited  significant  differences  in  product diversity when using 21 and 22 as acceptors; both mutant  enzymes  primarily  yielded  monoprenylated  products  (51b  and  57a) and showed increased conversion efficiency (Supplementary   Fig.  17).  These  seemingly  spurious  properties  of  the  E91A  and  E91Q  mutants,  as  well  as  the  molecular  mechanism  (or  mecha- nisms) responsible for the multiple prenylation capacity of AtaPT,  will require further investigation in the future.  With  an  appropriately  deep  understanding  of  the  molecular  mechanisms  of  AtaPTcatalyzed  prenylations,  it  should  be  pos- sible  to  use  structure-guided  mutagenesis  to  fine  tune  both  the   prenyl donor and the prenylation selectivity of AtaPT. This would  increase  the  utility  of  AtaPT  in  the  synthesis  of  new,  possibly   rationally designed prenylated derivatives for applications in drug  discovery programs.   e  R104  S93  S177  GSPP  DBu  L105 A91  R396 L83  W397  E91AGSPPDBu  48f 48e 48d 48c 48b 48a  DMAPP  GPP  47e 47d 47c 47b 47a  160  120  80  40  0  50c 50b 50a  G326M W T  DMAPP  500  400  300  200  100  0  160  120  80  40  0  a  Relative activity (%)  b  Relative activity (%)  c  FPP  49  E91 R396 H88  48f 48e 48d 48c 48b 48a  S177  DBu  GSPP  W397  120  80  40  0  Relative activity (%)  AtaPT11424 GSPPDBu d  160  G326M W T  GPP  51d 51c 51b 51a  G326M W T  FPP  52d 52c 52b 52a  G326M W T  G326M W T  G326M W T  W T  H88A  E91A  E91Q  E91D  77A 1 S  W 397A  Figure 6 | Structure-guided mutagenesis of AtaPT to alter its substrate  promiscuity.

DIScUSSION The  molecular  mechanisms  of  enzyme  promiscuity  have  been   discussed  in  different  subject  areas32.  However,  structural  results   are  fairly  scarce,  especially  for  complex  structures  with  a  single  enzyme bound to multiple or numerous substrates. This lack of data  has,  to  date,  limited  the  characterization  of  mechanisms  relating   to  enzyme  promiscuity.  In  the  present  study,  we  characterized   multiple  crystal  structures  of  AtaPT  in  complex  with  different   acceptors and/or donors, providing a solid structural basis to explore  the mechanistic basis of the extreme promiscuity of AtaPT. Thus,  our work adds important insights and empirical data that promise  to help elucidate the molecular basis of enzyme promiscuity.  The  molecular  mechanism  of  the  multiple-site  prenylations   on the aromatic rings that led to AtaPTs product diversity has not  been  fully  elucidated  in  the  present  study.  Rather,  we  speculate  that the spacious hydrophobic pocket allows AtaPT to accommo- date various aromatics and even some prenylated products. Each   aromatic  substrate  may  bind  AtaPT  at  different  sites  with  varied   orientations,  although  the  crystallographic  approach  can  only  capture  the  most  stable  state  of  a  substrate-bound  complex.  This  multiple  binding  scenario  would  allow  the  prenylation  to  occur  at  different  positions.  Furthermore,  the  prenylated  products  can   also  bind  the  spacious  hydrophobic  pocket  again,  facilitating  a   subsequent prenylation.  For  the  alteration  of  prenylation  patterns  between  the  E91A  and E91Q mutants, we offer the following speculations. Wild-type  AtaPT could accept 1 in two orientations (one for the insertion of  C4, the other for the insertion of C4), and 1, in both orientations,  could be prenylated with different binding affinities and catalytic  efficiencies. The prenylated 1 could bind AtaPT again with an alter- native orientation for the second prenylation. The crystal structure  of AtaPTGSPPDBu (Fig. 4) that we solved might represent one  orientation of 1 with a relatively high binding affinity. Whereas the  mutation of alanine or glutamine at E91 eliminates the binding of  1 in this orientation, in the crystal structure of E91AGSPPDBu,  the  second  orientation  of 1,  which  had  a  higher  binding  affinity,  could be captured (Fig. 6e). However, 1 bound in the orientation  amenable to the insertion of C4 could not be prenylated owing to  steric hindrance. Thus, the products 48b and 48c with the prenyla- tion sites at C3 and C4 could come from another position with low  binding affinity but high catalytic efficiency. As a result, even if the  prenylated 1 could reenter the acceptor-binding pocket, the second  prenylation could not be catalyzed. This scenario explains how the  prenylation profiles of the mutants could be altered substantially.  Traditionally,  enzymes  have  been  held  to  have  strict  specific- ity  for  their  substrates  and  for  the  reactions  that  they  catalyze32.  However, it is increasingly accepted that enzyme promiscuity is not  a rare phenomenon; rather, it seems to be widespread and may even  be an inherent feature in the biology of, for example, glycosyltrans- ferases33, transaminases34 and cytochrome P450s35. The promiscuous  enzymes are highly valuable in many synthetic applications, ranging  from laboratory to industry36, especially in reactions that are diffi- cult to access by chemical methods such as CC bond formation and  ring system construction. Therefore, there is a large drive to discover  or develop universal enzymes that can be used for general chemi- cal syntheses. In the present study, we showed that AtaPT not only  accepts various types of aromatic acceptors with complex structures  and various prenyl donors with different chain lengths but also con- ducts diverse mono-, di- or triprenylations with C- or O-prenylated  products. AtaPT is therefore an aPTase with substantial versatility  for use in the development of applications requiring prenylation.   received 17 March 2016; accepted 2 November 2016;  published online 19 December 2016  mEThODS Methods, including statements of data availability and any associated   accession codes and references, are available in the online version  of the paper.

The prenyl donors dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), geranyl  diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate  (GGPP) and phytyl diphosphate (PPP) were chemically synthesized accord- ing  to  the  literature38.  DMSPP  and  GSPP  were  purchased  from  Echelon  Biosciences.  ()-Butyrolactone  II  was  prepared  as  previously  reported24,39.  Optically  active  (+)-butyrolactone  II  (1)  and  ()-butyrolactone  II  (2)  were  isolated from ()-butyrolactone II via chiral HPLC using a Chiralpak AD-H  column (250 mm  4.6 mm i.d., 5 m, Daicel); their enantiomeric excess val- ues were over 99%. All other tested aromatic compounds were purchased from  Sigma-Aldrich, GL Biochem or BioBioPha. All of the tested aromatic substrates  displayed  NMR  and  MS  spectroscopic  data  consistent  with  those  reported   in the literature.  HPLC-grade methanol and acetonitrile were purchased from Merck; water  was purified and deionized by a water purification system from Tauto Biotech.  The HPLCMS grade formic acid used in this study was purchased from  Sigma-Aldrich. All of the other chemicals used in this study were obtained  from standard sources for laboratory use.  Chemical analyses. The analyses of substrate specificity and the determination  of conversion rates were performed on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system  coupled  with  an  LCQ  Fleet  ion  trap  mass  spectrometer  (Thermo  Electron)  equipped  with  an  electrospray  ionization  (ESI)  source.  The  LC  chromato- graph was equipped with a quaternary pump, a diode-array detector (DAD),   an auto-sampler, a column compartment and a Shiseido capcell pak C18 MG II  column (250 mm  4.6 mm i.d., 5 m, Shiseido). The mobile phase consisted  of a gradient elution of solvent A (i.e., 0.1% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution)  and solvent B (i.e., methanol or acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 30 C.   For  HPLCMS  analyses,  ultra-high  purity  helium  (He)  was  used  as  the   collision gas, and high-purity nitrogen (N2) was used as the nebulizing gas. The  optimized ESI source parameters were as follows: sheath gas flow rate, 20 (arbi- trary units); auxiliary gas flow rate, 5 (arbitrary units); spray voltage, 5.0 kV;  capillary temperature, 350 C; source collision-induced decomposition (CID),  35 V; tube lens offset voltage, 75 V. For full scan MS analysis, mass spectra  were recorded in the 1001,000 m/z range. The split ratio of effluent from the  LC to the ion source was 2:1. The data were analyzed using XCalibur software.  Cloning  of  AtaPT.  Total  RNA  was  isolated  from  the  3-day-old  mycelia  of   A. terreus with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) before being reverse transcribed with  SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase (Clontech). PCR amplification was carried  out on an iCycler from Bio-Rad. Using TransStart FastPfu DNA Polymerase  (TransGen Biotech), a PCR fragment of 1,275 bp, containing the entire coding  sequence of AtaPT, was amplified from the cDNA template using the forward  primer CDS-F and the reverse primer CDS-R (Supplementary Table 2). The  amplification product was digested with NdeI and XhoI, ligated into pET-28a  plasmid and transformed into DH5 E. coli cells. The identity of the resulting  pET-28aAtaPT  construct  was  confirmed  by  DNA  sequencing.  The  expres- sion construct was transformed into E. coli Transetta (DE3) cells (TransGen  Biotech). Mutations were introduced into AtaPT following the protocols for  the  Fast  Mutagenesis  System  (TransGen  Biotech).  All  primers  used  in  this  study (gene deletion, truncation and mutation) were synthesized by Generay  Biotech and are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.  Protein expression and purification. E. coli Transetta (DE3) cells harboring  the recombinant plasmid were cultured (10 ml) overnight in LB medium con- taining 50 g/ml kanamycin and 40 g/ml chloramphenicol. These cultures  were then added into 1 L of LB medium (containing 50 g/ml kanamycin and  40 g/ml chloramphenicol) and grown at 30 C with the incubator shaking at  200 r.p.m. When the optical density (OD600) of the culture reached 0.6, protein  overexpression was induced by the addition of 0.15 mM IPTG. The cells were  further cultured at 16 C for 20 h for expression of His-tagged AtaPT.  The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (15 min at 4,000g) and resuspended  in  a  lysis  buffer  (20  mM  imidazole,  20  mM  NaH2PO4-Na2HPO4,  0.5  mM   phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 g/ml DNase and 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4)  with the ratio of 3 ml lysis buffer per gram of cells (wet weight). Lysozyme was  added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After incubation on ice for 30 min,    the cells were ruptured with a VCX-130 sonifier (Sonics). Debris and mem- branes were removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 45 min. The supernatant  was applied to a Ni Sepharose 6 fast flow resin column (GE Healthcare) and  separated according to the manufacturers instructions, using a linear gradi- ent of 20500 mM imidazole (in 20 mM NaH2PO4-Na2HPO4, 500 mM NaCl,   pH 7.4). After SDSPAGE analysis, fractions containing pure AtaPT were  collected  and  concentrated  by  ultrafiltration  with  30-kDa  ultrafiltration   tubes (Millipore). To facilitate changing of the buffer, the protein fraction  was subjected to a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 50 mM  TrisHCl, 1 mM DTT and 1.5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4. The purified AtaPT  was stored at 80 C before being used in enzymatic assays.  The detailed procedures for protein expression and purification used here  for the crystallization study have been described previously by the authors22.  Assays for prenyltransferase activity and substrate specificity. For the enzyme  assays, the reaction mixture routinely contained 0.4 mM aromatic substrate,  0.8 mM isoprenoid substrate and 45 M AtaPT in 200 l of reaction buffer  (50 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM DTT, 1.5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4). Assays with heat- inactivated enzyme that had been boiled at 100 C for 15 min were used as  negative control reactions. After incubation for 16 h at 37 C, the reaction was  terminated by the addition of 400 l of MeOH and vortexing for 2 min. The  protein was removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 30 min. The superna- tant  was  directly  analyzed  by  HPLC-DAD-MS.  The  conversion  rates  of  the  enzyme reactions were calculated from peak areas of prenylated products and   substrates  as  analyzed  by  HPLC.  To  facilitate  inferential  statistical  analysis,  three  parallel  assays  were  routinely  performed;  mean    s.d.  from  triplicate  analyses are reported here.  To investigate the substrate specificity of AtaPT, a total of 106 aromatics  were tested as potential prenyl acceptors in assays using prenyl diphosphate  compounds of differing chain-lengths, including DMAPP, GPP, FPP, GGPP  and PPP. The structures of the 106 aromatics are detailed in Figure 1 and  Supplementary Figure 2.  Determination of kinetic parameters. For the determination of kinetic param- eters, 35 M of recombinant AtaPT was incubated with either various concen- trations of prenyl acceptors (20400 M) or a fixed concentration of prenyl  donors (DMAPP, GPP or FPP, 800 M) in a total volume of 200 l at 37 C for  30 min. All of these reactions were performed in triplicate, and enzyme activity  was evaluated via quantification of the corresponding prenylated derivatives as  nmol per mg of recombinant protein per minute. Kinetic parameters, includ- ing the MichaelisMenten constant (KM) and the turnover number (kcat), were  calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 5 software.  Preparation  and  identification  of  the  reaction  products.  To  prepare  the   enzymatic  products  for  structural  elucidation,  each  reaction  mixture,  all  of  which contained 2 mM prenyl acceptor, 4 mM prenyl donor and 45 M of  recombinant AtaPT in a total volume of 50 ml reaction buffer, was incubated  for 16 h at 37 C. The enzymatic product was extracted with EtOAc (10 ml  3).   The organic layers of these extracts were combined and concentrated under  vacuum. The resulting residue was further dissolved in MeOH, and the enzy- matic products were then purified by semi-preparative HPLC. The structures  of the enzymatic products were characterized by MS and NMR spectral and  polarimetric  analyses  (Supplementary  Note).  Optical  rotations  in  MeOH   were measured on a PerkinElmer Model-343 digital polarimeter (PerkinElmer).  NMR spectra were recorded on Varian NMR System 600 and 500 spectrom- eters (Varian). All spectra were processed with MestReNova.6.0.2 (Metrelab),  and chemical shifts were referenced to those of the solvent signals. Chemical  shifts are given in p.p.m. and coupling constants (J) are given in hertz (Hz). To  confirm the elemental composition of molecular ions with high mass accuracy,  an LCESIITTOFMS analysis was performed on a Shimadzu LCMSIT TOF instrument equipped with a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system.  Crystallization,  data  collection  and  structure  determination.  The  detailed  procedures  for  protein  crystallization  and  diffraction  data  collection  have  been  described  previously  by  the  authors22.  In  brief,  crystals  of  AtaPT11-424  were obtained using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 16 C.

After a multistep energy minimization process undertaken to avoid possible  clashes, the system was equilibrated in two steps: a 2-ns simulation with the  heavy atoms of the protein constrained and a 5-ns simulation with the pro- tein  backbone  constrained.  Subsequently,  free  molecular  dynamics  simula- tions  were  performed  without  any  constraints.  Two  individual  simulations  (named MD1 and MD2) were performed to verify repeatability; both MD1 and  MD2 lasted more than 140 ns. The DMSPP and GSPP bound AtaPT systems  were simulated with a similar strategy; the force field parameters for ligands   were from the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF)47. During the sim- ulations, the temperature was controlled at 300 K by the Langevin method,  and  the  pressure  was  controlled  at  1  atm  by  the  Langevin  piston  method.   The SHAKE method was used on all hydrogen-containing bonds to allow a   2-fs time step in the simulations. The simulation trajectories were analyzed  with the VMD program48.  38.

Substrates were soaked into crystals to yield complex struc- tures. To get crystals of the ternary complex, the crystals were first soaked with  prenyl donor compounds (DMSPP or GSPP) at a final concentration of 10 mM  and  then  soaked  with  various  acceptor  compounds  at  a  final  concentration   of 16 mM for DBu (1), 8 mM for LBu (2) and 8 mM for Gen (21). Prior to  diffraction  experiments,  all  of  the  crystals  were  soaked  in  a  cryoprotectant  solution (0.1 M BisTris, pH 6.0, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate and 30% (m/v)  PGE3350) and flash frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream.  Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at a wavelength of 0.97907  at the  BL17U beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Facility (SSRF) with the ADSC  Q315 CCD detector. The apo structure of AtaPT was solved by molecular  replacement using PHASER40 with the structure of FgaPT223 (PDB code 3I4Z)  as the initial model. Binary complex and ternary complex structures were  solved by molecular replacement using PHASER with the apo structure as a  starting model; the ligands were built on the basis of difference maps. All of  the structures were refined using Refmac5 (ref. 41). The statistics for the data  collection and refinement and the Ramachandran statistics are summarized  in Supplementary Table 5. Structure figures were illustrated using PyMOL   (http://www.pymol.org) and Chimera42. The substrate-binding pockets were  computed using HOLLOW37 and generated in PyMOL.

Isothermal  titration   calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed with a MicroCal iTC-200  titration micro-calorimeter (GE Healthcare) at 25 C. As a control, the sample  cell was filled with AtaPT (30 M buffered in 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM   NaCl). The AtaPT concentration was determined via a BCA (bicinchoninic   acid) method. DBu (1, 300 M) prepared in the same buffer was injected into  the sample cell in 2-min time intervals. In total, 20 injections were performed  within 40 min. DBu (1, 300 M) was titrated into the AtaPT protein solution  containing 300 M GSPP. All experiments were repeated three times. The data  were processed using Origin software (Version 7.0).

White, and Valerie de Crecy-Lagard*, Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, United States Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, United States Department of Chemistry, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon 97207, United States  * S Supporting Information  ABSTRACT: The biosynthesis of GTP derived metabolites such as tetrahydrofolate (THF), biopterin (BH4), and the modified tRNA nucleosides queuosine (Q) and archaeosine (G+) relies on several enzymes of the Tunnel-fold superfamily. A subset of these proteins includes the 6-pyruvoyltetrahy- dropterin (PTPS-II), PTPS-III, and PTPS-I homologues, all members of the COG0720 family that have been previously shown to transform 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2NTP) into different products. PTPS-II catalyzes the formation of 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin in the BH4 pathway, PTPS-III catalyzes the formation of 6-hydroxylmethyl-7,8- dihydropterin in the THF pathway, and PTPS-I catalyzes the formation of 6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin in the Q pathway. Genes of these three enzyme families are often misannotated as they are difficult to differentiate by sequence similarity alone. Using a combination of physical clustering, signature motif, phylogenetic codistribution analyses, in vivo complementation studies, and in vitro enzymatic assays, a complete reannotation of the COG0720 family was performed in prokaryotes. Notably, this work identified and experimentally validated dual function PTPS-I/III enzymes involved in both THF and Q biosynthesis. Both in vivo and in vitro analyses showed that the PTPS-I family could tolerate a translation of the active site cysteine and was inherently promiscuous, catalyzing different reactions on the same substrate or the same reaction on different substrates. Finally, the analysis and experimental validation of several archaeal COG0720 members confirmed the role of PTPS-I in archaeosine biosynthesis and resulted in the identification of PTPS-III enzymes with variant signature sequences in Sulfolobus species. This study reveals an expanded versatility of the COG0720 family members and illustrates that for certain protein families extensive comparative genomic analysis beyond homology is required to correctly predict function.  GTP is a precursor of RNA, DNA, and a number of other fundamental metabolites. Among these are riboflavin and the deazaflavin derivatives related to F420; the pterin related coenzymes tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), tetrahydrofolate (THF), methanopterin, and molybdopterin; and a variety of 7- deazaguanine derivatives such as queuosine (Q) and archae- osine (G+), found in tRNA, and toyacamycin and tubercidin, which are secondary metabolites produced in Streptomyces.  Many of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of these GTP derived metabolites are members of the same structural superfamily, the Tunnel-fold or T-fold superfamily.1 This superfamily comprises a functionally diverse set of enzymes that assemble through oligomerization of a core domain composed of a pair of two-stranded antiparallel -sheets and two helices to form a  2n n barrel.1 Two barrels associate in a head-to-head fashion and bind planar substrates such as purines or pterins at the interface using a conserved Glu/Gln residue to anchor the substrate. Illustrating the diversity of the reactions catalyzed by T-fold enzymes, two enzymes of the BH4 synthesis pathway (Figure 1A) belong to the T-fold superfamily, GTP cyclohydrolase IA (GCYH-IA or FolE) and 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahy- dropterin synthase (PTPS-II or PtpS).2 GCYH-IA catalyzes the first step of the pathway producing 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2NTP) from GTP.3,4 H2NTP is then converted to 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin (PTP) by PTPS-II5,6 (Figure 1A), and PTP is then reduced to BH4 by sepiapterin reductase (SR encoded by the spr gene and part of the dehydrogenase- reductase (SDR) superfamily).79    GCYH-IA is also the first enzyme of the THF biosynthetic pathway.3 It is replaced in some organisms by GTP cyclohydrolase IB (GCYH-IB or FolE2),10 another T-fold enzyme.11 In most plants and Bacteria the THF pathway contains a second T-fold enzyme, dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA), encoded in Escherichia coli by folB12 (Figure 1A). Furthermore, in Plasmodium falciparum and various bacteria, the DHNA step is bypassed by yet another T-fold enzyme, PTPS-III, a homologue of PTPS-II, that cleaves the side chain of H2NTP to form 6-hydroxylmethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (6HMDP)1315 (Figure 1A).   Figure 1. Separation of COG0720 into six subfamilies by comparative genomic analysis. (A) Known or predicted roles of COG0720 proteins in GTP derived metabolic pathways. (B) Physical clustering of the four PTPS subfamilies (IIV) with genes of folate, BH4, Q, or riboflavin synthesis pathways. Abbreviations and enzyme names are described in the main text.    Queuosine (Q) is a 7-deazaguanosine derivative found at position 34 of several bacterial and eukaryal tRNAs,1618 while archaeosine (G+), a related derivative, is found specifically at position 15 of archaeal tRNA.19 Like the flavin and folate pathways, the Q/G+ pathways are populated by T-fold enzymes, and GCYH-IA (or GCYH-IB) catalyzes the first biosynthetic steps.20 The second enzyme of the pathway, PTPS-I or QueD, is homologous to PTPS-II and catalyzes the formation of 6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin from DHNTP in vitro21 (Figure 1A). Finally, the enzyme QueF, an oxidoreductase that reduces the nitrile side chain of 7-cyano- 7-deazaguanine (preQ0), the last common intermediate in the Q and G+ pathways,22,23 to the aminomethyl side chain of 7- aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1), is also a T-fold enzyme.24  Functional diversity is found not only between the different T-fold subfamilies but also within a given subfamily. As alluded to above, three members of the COG0720 subfamily, PTPS-I, II, and III, have been shown to catalyze different reactions in different pathways (Figure 1A), and a fourth COG0720 member, PTPS-IV, whose structure was recently determined, has an as yet unknown function.25  By combining comparative genomic with biochemical and genetic characterization, we provide evidence that the COG0720 family is an example of a family of enzymes containing functionally promiscuous members. This functional promiscuity is exploited in vivo with single enzymes contributing different reactions to different pathways.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   Separation of Four COG0720 Subfamilies by Com- parative Genomics. Because of its functional diversity, the COG0720 family of enzymes is particularly difficult to annotate. Out of 810 bacterial COG0720 sequences in the NCBI database as of July 2010, 516 are annotated in RefSeq26 as 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase, or PTPS-II. However, with the exception of specific cyanobacteria that synthesize glycosylated BH4 derivatives,27 the BH4 pathway is absent in most of these organisms, and thus these enzymes likely have activities other than that of a PTPS-II. To illustrate the difficulty of annotating COG0720 members using sequence similarity (BLAST score) alone, the rat PTPS-II protein (NP_058916.1) was used as input to search the Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 genome using default BLASTP parameters,28 and two COG0720 proteins were retrieved. The one with the lowest similarity (YP_400201.1; E-value: 5e-20) has robust canonical PTPS-II activity in vitro, whereas the one with the highest similarity (YP_400970.1; E-value 6e-31) exhibits only low activity, and deletion of the corresponding gene does not affect BH4 levels in vivo.27 Transferring the function of the experimentally characterized member of the family, the rat PTPS-II, to the best scoring homologue in Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 therefore results in an erroneous annotation. In order to better annotate the COG0720 family, other types of association evidence were required. Using the SEED database,29 we performed a comparative genomic analysis of the four PTPS families (I to IV). A subsystem named Experimental PTPS was constructed that included all of the COG0720 homologues in the database. More than one copy of the gene was found in 114 of the 918 genomes analyzed, confirming that the misannotation risk is indeed very high.    Figure 2.

Genome abbreviations: Sa, Synthrophus aciditrophicus; Cb, Clostridium botulinum; Ec, Escherichia coli; Rn, Rattus norvegicus.     Physical clustering analysis revealed that specific members of the COG0720 subfamilies could be efficiently separated by analyzing their genomic context. Twenty-four COG0720 genes cluster with other genes of the BH4 pathway such as folE and spr (Figure 1B and see Experimental PTPS subsystem in SEED) and hence were annotated as ptpS genes encoding PTPS-II enzymes. Another 283 COG0720 genes cluster with queuosine genes (queCEF)30 and folE or folE220 (Figure 1B and see Experimental PTPS subsystem in SEED) and were therefore annotated as queD encoding PTPS-I enzymes. Finally, 16 COG0720 genes cluster with folate biosynthesis genes such as folE, folK, and folP (Figure 1B and see Experimental PTPS subsystem in SEED) and were annotated as encoding PTPS-III enzymes.  We derived signature motifs for these three subfamilies of enzymes using the PRATT tool from the PROSITE suite31 as well as Web Logo 3.0.32 The sequences of the experimentally characterized enzymes, as well as sequences from additional members predicted through physical clustering, were used as input for each COG0720 subgroup. Previous sequence and structural analysis of the PTPS-III family had shown that it could be distinguished from the PTPS-II family by the presence of specific motifs surrounding the catalytic residues:13 {CX(5)- H-G-H} for PTPS-II enzymes and {E-X(2)-H-G-H} for PTPS- III enzymes. We confirmed and slightly expanded these two signature motifs and identified the signature motif for the PTPS-I family as {C-X(3)-H-G-H} (Supplemental Figure 1). PTPS-IV encoding genes are found in only a few halophilic Archaea and Actinomycetes (a total of 14 organisms), and members of the PTPS-IV family are still of unknown function, although physical clustering suggests a link with riboflavin. Indeed, in Archaea PTPS-IV genes cluster with GTP-cyclo- hydrolase III (GCYH-III) genes (arfA)33 and in Bacteria with GTP-cyclohydrolase II genes (ribA2) that contain mutations conferring GTP-cyclohydrolase III type activity,34 and in both they further cluster with a formamide hydrolase gene (arf B) that encodes the subsequent enzyme in this GCYH-III dependent riboflavin pathway.35 We therefore predict that PTPS-IV proteins are involved in the synthesis of a product derived from 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5-phosphate (APy), the riboflavin/F420 biosynthetic intermedi- ate generated by the ArfA and ArfB proteins. A PTPS-IV signature motif, {F-X(0,1)-G-X-[ANTV]-[NPQST]} was iden- tified using the 14 PTPS-IV sequences as input (Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1). Finally, two groups of COG0720 proteins (PTPS-V and VI) that do not contain any of the motifs identified in the PTPS-I/II/III/IV families were found in Crenarchaea (listed in Supplemental data 1). The PTPS-V members are found in all sequenced Pyrobaculum sp., in Vulcanisaeta sp., and in Thermoproteus neutrophilus and contain a {S-X(2)-W-X(3)-H-G-H} motif. The PTPS-VI members are found in Metallosphaera sedula DSM 5348 and in all sequenced Sulfolobus species and contain a {S-S-X(4)-Q-X-H-G-H} motif. The functions of these last two families of COG0720 proteins are unknown.    Table 1.

The combination of physical clustering and motif analysis allowed us to differentiate six COG0720 subfamilies and derive signature motifs that were used to propagate the annotations in the SEED database (see Experimental-PTPS subsystem).  PTPS-I/III Enzymes Can Function in Both Folate and Q Pathways. Genomic analysis revealed that a group of bacteria (Supplemental Table 1) contained only one COG0720 encoding gene but were predicted to require both PTPS-III and PTPS-I activities as they possessed Q biosynthetic genes (queCEF) as well as the signature folate genes folK and folP (examples are shown in Figure 2A) but lacked folB (encoding DHNA). Closer analysis of the COG0720 proteins encoded in these organisms revealed that they contained a hybrid PTPS-I/ PTPS-III motif {C-E-X-[ILPV]-H-G-H} (Supplemental Table 1). We had previously shown that the predicted PTPS-I/IIISa enzyme from Syntrophus acidotrophicus (YP_462286.1) ex- hibited PTPS-III activity in vivo as the corresponding gene complemented the thymidine (dT) auxotrophy of an E.coli folB strain.15 However, physical clustering linked the corresponding gene to the Q biosynthesis pathway (Figure 1B). More generally, out of 38 genes encoding proteins containing the dual motif, 7 of them cluster with folate biosynthesis genes and 14 of them cluster with Q biosynthesis genes (see Experimental PTPS subsystem in SEED). To test whether the PTPS-III proteins containing hybrid motifs also exhibited PTPS-I activity, we examined the nucleoside constituents of bulk tRNA purified from cultures of WT E. coli transformed with pBAD24 (VDC3339) and of queD strains transformed with pBAD24 (VDC3321) or with derivatives expressing the PTPS-I/IIISa gene (VDC3335) or the PTPS-I/IIISaCys26Ala gene (VDC3365). Bulk tRNAs were enzymatically hydrolyzed and dephosphorylated, and the ribonucleosides were analyzed by LCESIMS/MS as described previously.20 The 410 m/z ion that corresponds to the molecular ion (MH+) of Q was detected by MS at 20.31 min in the WT background, whereas no 410 m/z ion was detected in the queD strain (Figure 2B). Expression of the PTPS-I/IIISa gene complemented the Q phenotype of the E. coli queD mutant (Figure 2B). Mutating Cys26 of the {C-E-X- [ILPV]-H-G-H} motif to Ala in the S. acidotrophicus protein abolished complementation of the Q phenotype but not the dT auxotrophy phenotype (Table 1). Expressing a canonical PTPS-IIILi gene from Leptospira interrogans (NP_712930.1) did not lead to complementation of the Q phenotype (Table 1), whereas the same clone was effective in complementing the dT auxotrophy phenotype of the folB strain.15 In addition, the P T P S - I C b a n d P T P S - I / I I I C b (YP_001383205.1) genes from Clostridium botulinum strain 19397 were analyzed in both complementation tests. In this organism, the PTPS-ICb gene clusters with Q biosynthesis genes and the PTPS-I/IIICb gene clusters with folate biosynthesis genes (Figure 1B). Both complemented the Q phenotype and thus were active as PTPS-I enzymes (Table 1). Only PTPS-I/ IIICb complemented the dT auxotrophy phenotype and thus exhibited PTPS-III activity (Figure 2C). These results show that COG0720 members that contain hybrid PTPS-III/I motifs are active in both folate and Q biosynthesis pathways and that the conserved cysteine in that motif is critical for PTPS-I activity but not PTPS-III activity.

All Euryarchaea predicted to synthesize preQ0 because of the presence of the queCE genes encode a PTPS-I like protein (see Experimental PTPS subsystem in SEED). PTPS-I genes are surprisingly absent in many Crenarchaea, some of which are known to make G+,36 although many have the PTPS-V or PTPS-VI variant. Finally, several archaeal genomes encode more than one COG0720 protein (Supplemental data 1), such as Haloferax volcanii, which contains both putative PTPS-I (HVO_1718) and PTPS-IV genes (HVO_1282).    Figure 3. Genetic evidence for the possible functions of Archaeal COG0720.

(D) Genetic evidence that SSO2412 gene (PTPS-VI) is involved in folate biosynthesis. Complementation of dT auxotrophy phenotype of E. coli folB with SSO2412 cloned in pBAD24. Growth was monitored after 48 h on LB plates containing 100 g/mL Amp and supplemented when noted with 0.2% Ara or 80 g/mL dT. Genome abbreviation: Ec, Escherichia coli.  Because H. volcanii is known to contain G+-modified tRNA37 and many of the genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes have been identified (folE2, HVO_2348; queC, HVO_1717; and queE, HVO_1716 ) and shown to be essential for G+ formation,20,38 it was logical to propose that HVO_1718 encodes the QueD/PTPS-I protein involved in G+ synthesis. A HVO_1718 derivative was constructed as described in the Methods section. Subsequent analysis of ribonucleosides from bulk tRNA extracted from the H. volcanii WT and HVO_1718 strains grown in minimal medium showed that the peak observed for the molecular ion of G+ (325 m/z), corresponding to the 26.2 min peak detected on the UV trace present in the WT H. volcanii H26 strain, was absent in the mutant strain (Figure 3A). Expression of the PTPS-I gene from Halobacterium sp. NRC1 (Vng6306) on the shuttle vector pJAM202 complemented the G+ deficiency phenotype of the HVO_1718 strain (Supplemental Figure 2), clearly establish- ing HVO_1718 as encoding a functional PTPS-I.  The function of the PTPS-IV protein in H. volcanii is less clear. H. volcanii is rare among Archaea in having a complete folate pathway,39,40 but genes encoding FolB or PTPS-III could not be identified in this organism.41 One possibility is that although PTPS-IV lacks the PTPS-III signature motif, it functionally replaces FolB. To test this hypothesis a HVO_1282 strain was constructed, but unlike the H. volcanii folE2 mutant previously constructed,42 it did not require dT for growth, suggesting that PTPS-IV is not involved in folate biosynthesis (Figure 3B). Physical clustering suggested a possible link between PTPS-IV and riboflavin biosynthesis (Figure 1B). Some of the canonical riboflavin biosynthetic genes are known to be missing in Archaea,35 thus we tested the involvement of HVO_1282 in riboflavin biosynthesis. As a control, we constructed a H. volcanii ribA deletion strain (HVO_1284); as shown in Figure 3C, no growth defect in the absence of riboflavin was observed in the HVO_1282 strain, whereas the HVO_1284 strain required riboflavin to grow as expected. At this point, however, even though comparative genomic analysis links the PTPS-IV family to the synthesis of an APy derivative, the family does not appear to be directly involved in the synthesis of riboflavin.    Finally, we investigated whether the variant COG0720 members found in Sulfolobus solfataricus or in Pyrobaculum calidifontis had QueD or FolB activity in E. coli complementa- tion tests. We found that the SSO2412 gene (PTPS-VI family) could complement the dT auxotrophy of the folB mutant (Figure 3D) but not the Q deficiency of the queD strain (Table 1). We failed to see any complementation of either phenotype by the Pcal_1063 gene (PTPS-V family) in the conditions tested.    Figure 4.

The reaction products 6-carboxypterin and pterin were confirmed by GCMS of their TMS- derivatives.   In Vitro and In Vivo Flexibility of the Bacterial and Archaeal PTPS-I Catalytic Site. An exhaustive comparative analysis of the Zur regulon43 revealed that certain bacteria contained two copies of the queD/PTPS-I gene, queD and queD2, with queD2 predicted to be under the control of negative regulator Zur (Supplemental Table 2). Zur is a repressor that responds to zinc levels and upregulates genes under its control when zinc is low.44 These include genes encoding high-affinity zinc transporters such as ZnuABC and paralogs of zinc-dependent enzymes that can use metals other than zinc.45 Analysis of the QueD2 sequences showed that these harbored a {C-X(4)-H-G-H} motif instead of the {C- X(3)-H-G-H} found in canonical QueD/PTPS-I enzymes (Supplemental Table 2). Furthermore, certain organisms, such as Acinetobacter baylyi sp. ADP1, contain only a queD2 gene and no queD gene (Supplemental Table 2). To test whether QueD2 proteins were functional PTPS-I enzymes, we expressed the A. baylyi sp. ADP1 queD2Ab gene (YP_046954.1) in the E. coli queD strain (VDC4660). As shown in Table 1, complementation of the Q phenotype was observed, confirming QueD2 does possess PTPS-I activity. Interestingly, introducing the Lys23Cys and Cys24Ser mutations in the E. coli QueD protein, thereby changing the {KC-X(3)-H-G-H} motif to a {C-X(4)-H-G-H} motif, also allowed functional complementation (Table 1), suggesting that the PTPS-I catalytic pocket is quite plastic. To probe this idea further, we tested whether PTPS-II enzymes, with {C-X(5)-H-G-H} signature motifs, also exhibited PTPS-I activity. Previous studies had shown that PTPS-I from Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 did possess PTPS-II activity in vitro (albeit only 10% of the activity of the canonical PTPS-II from the same organism),27 but the reverse scenario had never been tested. As shown in Figure 2B and Table 1, expressing the rat ptpSRn gene in the E. coli queD mutant (strain VDC3331) did restore the production of Q, demonstrating that the rat PTPS-II exhibited enough PTPS-I activity to functionally replace the chromoso- mal encoded queD, at least when expressed on a multicopy plasmid. Finally, we tested whether a motif containing a shortened spacer {C-X(2)-H-G-H} still led to a functional PTPS-I enzyme by transforming the E. coli queD and folB strains with a plasmid expressing a mutant PTPS-I/IIISa enzyme possessing the Cys26Ala and Glu27Cys double mutation. Like the Cys26Ala single mutant, this clone failed to complement the Q phenotype, but unlike the single mutant, it also failed to complement the dT auxotrophy (Table 1).  The plasticity of the PTPS active site had already been suggested by the report that the E. coli PTPS-I/QueD enzyme displayed relaxed substrate selectivity in vitro, utilizing H2NTP or sepiapterin to form 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin (PTPS-II activity) or 7,8-dihydropterin, respectively, the latter a fundamentally new activity of side-chain cleavage.21,46 Using a direct in vitro assay for activity that eliminates potential artifacts introduced through postreaction workup, the activity of the E. coli enzyme was subsequently shown to produce only 6- carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (CPH4),21 the biologically relevant product. We show here that this enzyme is able to produce CPH4 from several substrates, including H2NTP, sepiapterin, and dihydroneopterin monophosphate (H2NMP) (Figure 4AE). Collectively these results demonstrate that the E. coli QueD enzyme is able to catalyze the formation of a common product from multiple substrates.     Figure 5.

Using Accelerys DS Vizualizer 2.5, R. norvegicus PTPS-II (black, PDB: 1B66) and the P. aeruginosa PTPS-I (gray, PDB: 2OBA) structures were superimposed with a rmsd of 0.3942.

Distances of the respective nucleophilic centers (the S atom of Cys42 and Cys24) from the Zn2+ ion were measured as shown in the inset table. The distances from the O atom of C1OH and C2OH of the biopterin side chain were also measured and are shown in the inset table. (C) Superimposition of the structures of PTPS-I (gray, PDB: 2OBA) and PTPS-III (black, PDB: 1Y13) was performed using the bioinformatics server FATCAT tool imbedded in PDB.

(D) Close-up of the three His residues coordinating the essential Zn2+ ion used as the reference points to show the relative occupation in space of the active site nucleophile Glu38 in P. falciparum PTPS-III (black) and the nucleophile Cys24 in P. aeruginosa PTPS-I (gray). Distances of the respective nucleophilic centers (the O atom of Glu38 and S from Cys24) from the Zn2+ ion were measured as shown in the inset table. The distances from the O atom of C1OH and C2OH of the biopterin side chain were also measured and are shown in the table.   To test if other members of the PTPS-I family shared this substrate plasticity, we investigated the catalytic activity of the predicted archaeal PTPS-I enzyme from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, MJ1272. We first confirmed that MJ1272 was a member of this family as it catalyzed the formation of CPH4 from the expected biological substrate, dihydroneopterin-2,3- cyclic phosphate (H2NMPc)47 (Figure 4F). The generation of CPH4 in these reactions was established by detection of two of its oxidative decomposition products, 6-carboxypterin and pterin. The pterin was labeled with deuterium when the incubation was conducted in deuterated water, consistent with the incorporation of deuterium at C-6 during retroaldol reaction leading to the formation of CPH4. This was retained and measured in the pterin produced by its subsequent oxidative decomposition. Furthermore, MJ1272 also exhibited good activity with a variety of other pterin substrates, including dihydroneopterin, sepiapterin and H2NMP (as shown in Figure 4F). These results demonstrate that, like the E.coli QueD, MJ1272 can catalyze the formation of a common product from multiple substrate pterins.  Structural Analysis of the COG0720 Family. The PTPS-II family has been the most thoroughly investigated structurally, and a detailed chemical mechanism has been proposed.48 The 3D structure of the rat liver PTPS-II exhibits a homohexameric structure formed by a dimer of trimers with 3- fold symmetry.5 On the basis of molecular modeling, site- directed mutagenesis, and refined crystal structures of the enzyme alone and in complex with natural substrate, it was shown that substrate binding occurs at the interface of 3 subunits, comprising two subunits from one trimer and one subunit from the opposing trimer.48 Because of this structure, catalytically important residues are contributed from multiple subunits. For example, the active site residue Cys42 (Rattus norvegicus PTPS-II numbering) is contributed from a subunit of one trimer, while Asp88 and His89, which complete the catalytic triad with Cys42, and the Zn2+ binding residues His23, His48, and His50 are contributed by a subunit in the adjacent trimer.48,49 The proposed reaction involves base-catalyzed isomerization followed by triphosphate elimination,48,50 with Zn2+ serving to activate the substrate and stabilize the intermediates so as to disfavor breaking of the C1C2 bond in the pyruvoyl side-chain.48    Figure 6. Condensed summary of the reactions involved in the mechanisms of PTPS-I, PTPS-II, and PTPS-III to generate their specific products.    To gain insight into the structural basis for plasticity of the PTPS active sites, the structure of rat PTPS-II that produces 6- pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PDB: 1B66) was compared with the structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PTPS-I that produces CPH4 (PDB: 2OBA) using the Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.5 tool. Structural superimposition was made based on monomers of each protein structure. The best global fit was obtained when using the PTPS-II structure from R. norvegicus as a reference with the following three homology regions as anchoring sites: the region from Thr66 to Gly67, the region from Thr105 to Glu107, and the third from Glu133 to Tyr134 (R. norvegicus numbering) (Figure 5A). Overall, the two structures super- impose with a rmsd of 0.4. The spatial locations of the canonical T-fold Glu residues, which interact with the exocyclic 2-amino group of the pterin, are conserved in both structures (Glu 133/Glu107).48 The catalytic residues Asp88 and His89 (R. norvegicus numbering) of the active site are superimposable with the catalytic residues Asp67 and His68 of the P. aeruginosa PTPS-I (PDB: 2OBA). The Zn2+ binding His residues of PTPS-II (His23, His48, and His50)48 occupy the same coordinates as the Zn 2+ binding residues (His13, His28, and His30) of PTPS-I (Figure 5B). Although the catalytic Cys residues involved in catalysis do not completely overlap, the distances from Cys to Zn2+ are similar in both enzymes (Figure  5 Table inset). Despite these shared active site characteristics, the R. norvegicus PTPS-II has two extra helix domains around the active site region, one found on the N-terminal side adjacent to Cys42 and the other around Asp88/His89 (Figure 5A).  The superimposition of the PTPS-I from P. aeruginosa (PDB: 2OBA chainA) and PTPS-III from Plasmodium falciparum (PDB: 1Y13 chain A) performed with the rigid FATCAT algorithm showed that the two structures superimpose with a rmsd of 2.2 (Figure 5C). As was observed in the comparison of the PTPS-I and PTPS-II structures, most of the conserved catalytic residues overlap well; thus, Asp67 and His68 in PTPS- I overlap with the Asp79 and His80 in PTPS-III, the spatial coordinates of the three Zn2+ binding His residues are conserved in both structures, and the spatial locations of the canonical T-fold Glu residues are conserved in both structures (Glu107/Glu161) (Figure 5C and D). Furthermore, while the key catalytic residue Cys24 in PTPS-I is replaced by Glu38 in the active site of PTPS-III (Figure 5D), the distances of the side chain groups of Cys24 and Glu38 to the respective Zn2+ are similar, and thus the spatial positions of the two putative general acid/base residues with respect to Zn2+ are comparable in the two enzymes (Figure 5 Table inset). However, there are noteworthy differences between the two structures; the loops containing the active site do not overlap completely, and PTPS- III has an extra loop close to the active site region (Figure 5C). Despite the active sites similarities among the three PTPS enzymes, the notable differences around the active sites could influence substrate binding allowing the production of different products.     Discussion. The combination of comparative genomic analyses and experimental validation allowed separation of the COG0720 family into at least six functional subfamilies (PTPS-I through PTPS-VI), illustrating the diversity of its catalytic potential. The subfamilies have similar but distinct catalytic activities and are involved in different pathways, three of which have been identified: folate biosynthesis for PTPS-III, Q/G+ biosynthesis for PTPS-I, and biopterin biosynthesis for PTPS-II. Of particular interest is the observation that some members of the COG0720 family have both PTPS-I and PTPS- III activity in vivo and that these proteins harbor a hybrid catalytic motif {C-E-X(2)-H-G-H}. This is an example where catalytic promiscuity of a single enzyme satisfies different metabolic needs in different pathways. An example of this phenomenon is observed with o-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS), a member of the enolase superfamily, which functions both as succinylbenzoate synthase in menaquinone biosynthetic pathway and as an N-succinylamino acid racemase (NSAR) in the racemization of N-acetylmethionine.51,52 Only an amino acid change (changing {C-X(3)-H-G-H} to {C-E-X(2)-H-G- H}) is necessary to transform a PTPS-I into a PTPS-I/III,15 and only one additional mutation (the Cys to another amino acid) is required to transform a PTPS-I/III to a PTPS-III. This latter phenomenon, in which the identity of a single residue can change the predominant product of the enzyme, is similar to observations of the GCYH II/III enzymes, where a single Tyr or Met residue at a key position results in an enzyme with type- II or type-III activity, respectively.34  Although PTPS-I is able to accept a variety of substrates in vitro, the actual biological substrate for PTPS-I enzymes remains uncertain. In methanogenic Archaea the product of GCYH-I is H2NMPc,47 whereas in Bacteria it is H2NTP, so it is possible that both are further processed by a phosphatase to form H2NMP as the relevant substrate in vivo. Further work is needed to differentiate between these two possibilities.  The functions of the COG0720 family members might also be dependent on the identity of the bound metal. PTPS-II enzymes are thought to be zinc-dependent,49 and while the metal dependence of PTPS-III enzymes has not been rigorously determined, the structures of the P. falciparum (PDB: 1Y13) and Plasmodium vivax (PDB: 2A0S) proteins show a bound Zn2+. Interestingly, in the PTPS-I family the archaeal member MJ1272 appears to be Fe2+-dependent (see Supporting Information). This might be a methanogen-specific trait as M. jannaschii FolE2 (or MptA), another T-fold superfamily member, is also Fe2+-dependent,47 whereas in bacteria such as B. subtilis and Neisseria gonorrheae the enzyme is most active with Mn2+.11 Finally, genes encoding QueD2 variants with a different active site signature [{C-X(4)-H-G-H} instead of {C- X(3)-H-G-H}] were predicted to be under Zur regulation, consistent with the canonical QueD requiring zinc, whereas the QueD2 enzymes use another metal. Several cases are now known in which paralogs of zinc-dependent enzymes that use metals other than zinc are upregulated when zinc is low (see ref 53 for examples). Nevertheless, while the existing data is compelling, detailed investigation of the metal dependence of these enzymes will be required to determine if varied metal dependence in fact contributes to the catalytic potential of COG0720 members.  Consideration of the transformations catalyzed by PTPS-I, PTPS-II, and PTPS-III reveals that each can be explained by the involvement of general acid/base catalysis in mediating retroaldol, cleavage/elimination, isomerization, elimination, and hydration reactions (Figure 6). Thus PTPS-III requires only a retroaldol cleavage and isomerization to produce dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin, and PTPS-II requires an isomerization followed by an elimination of triphosphate to produce 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin. The fact that PTPS-I can utilize sepiapterin as well as H2NTP (and the di- and monophosphates) led to the proposal21 of a mechanistically complex series of reactions in which the first three reactions are the same as that used by PTPS-II to produce PTP, followed by two isomerization reactions, a hydration, and finally a retroaldol reaction to produce CPH4. However, given the observed promiscuity of these enzymes it is possible that the activity with sepiapterin does not reflect an actual role in the reaction catalyzed with H2NTP, as one can envision a much simpler route to CPH4 in two steps via similar acid/base-catalyzed transformations (Figure 6); differentiating these 2 pathways may be possible by evaluating the kinetic competence of sepiapterin once PTPS-I has been kinetically characterized with the dihydroneopterin substrates. Overall, the products of the various PTPS enzymes are all accessible via subtle changes in the expression of general acid/base catalysis operating in each of these systems.  Even after this extensive characterization of the COG0720 family many questions remain. The function of the PTPS-IV subfamily is still unknown; it was already known not to function as a PTPS-II.25 We have shown here that it possesses neither PTPS-III nor PTPS-I activity and that it has no direct role in riboflavin synthesis. PTPS-I is missing in many Crenarchaea that make G+, such as Sulfolobus or Pyrobaculum species19,36,54 (see Experimental-PTPS subsystem in SEED), and possible candidates for this activity are the PTPS-V and PTPS-VI families that are found in many Crenarchaea (Supplemental data 1). However, while expressing the PTPS-VI from S. solfataricus SSO2412 complemented an E. coli folB mutant, it did not complement a queD mutant, so it is unlikely that the PTPS-VI family harbors the missing PTPS-I activity in Crenarchaea. Notably, although the PTPS-VI enzymes exhibit PTPS-III activity (based on the folB complementation result), they lack the PTPS-III signature motif. Further biochemical work will be required to fully characterize this complex COG0720 family.     METHODS  Chemicals. All chemicals were obtained from Aldrich/Sigma unless otherwise indicated.  Bioinformatics. Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution and physical clustering was performed in the SEED database.29 Results are available in the Experimental-PTPS subsystem on the public SEED server (http://theseed.uchicago.edu/FIG/subsys.cgi). We also used the BLAST tools and resources at NCBI.28 The H. volcanii genome sequence was accessed through the UCSC archaeal genome browser.55 Multiple alignments were built using the ClustalW tool.56 The PRATT tool31 from the Prosite Web site (http://expasy.org/prosite/) was used to derive the specific protein motifs. These motifs were used to examine the COG0720 family using ScanProsite.57 The same Prosite motifs were also used to search for pattern occurrence in protein queries using Phi-BLAST at NCBI.58 Web logo (http://weblogo. berkeley.edu/logo.cgi)32 was used to create sequence logos for the four PTPS families.

First, the sequences of PTPS-I from P. aeruginosa (PDB: 2OBA) and PTPS- II from R. norvegicus (PDB: 1B6Z) were aligned using ClustalW256 to find conserved regions along the aligned sequences that were used as anchoring points for the superimposition. The 3D superimpositions were performed using the superimposition tool of the software Discovery Studio 2.5 (http://accelrys.com/)60,61 and the super- imposition tools of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (http://www.pdb. org).  Strains, Media, Growth, and Transformation. All strains and plasmids used are listed in Supplemental Table 3. E. coli derivatives were routinely grown at 37 C in LB (BD Diagnostic System) or minimal M9 medium62 supplemented with 0.4% glycerol as a carbon source. Growth media were solidified with 15 g L 1 agar (BD Diagnostic System) for the preparation of plates. Transformations of E. coli were performed following standard procedures.62 Ampicillin (Amp, 100 g mL1), thymidine (dT, 80 M), kanamycin (Kan, 50 g/mL), isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mM), and L- arabinose (0.2%) were added when needed. H. volcanii derivatives were grown at 45 C in Hv-YPC rich medium63 and Hv-min minimal medium.64 Riboflavin (20 g mL1), uracil (50 or 10 g mL1), novobiocin (Nov, 0.2 g mL1), and 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA, 50 g mL1) were added when needed. H. volcanii growth media was solidified with 20 g L1 agar (BD Diagnostic System) for preparation of the plates. Transformations of H. volcanii were performed essentially as described.65  Plasmid and Strain Constructions for Genetic Studies. All primers used for plasmid and strain construction, site directed mutagenesis, and strain verification are listed in Supplemental Table 4. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed using Phusion Hot Start (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) as previously described.66 The genomic DNA from H. volcanii and Halobacterium sp. NRC.1 were prepared as previously described.64 E. coli and A. baylyi sp. ADP1 genomic DNA were prepared as previously described.62  The ygcM gene (NP_417245.1) was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA using primers ygcM.ol1 and ygcM.ol2 bearing EcoRI sites and cloned into pBAD24. The PTPS-IAb gene (YP_046954.1) was amplified from A. baylyi genomic DNA using primers QueDADP1_E- coRI_Fw and QueDADP1_XbaI_Re and cloned into pBAD24 after digestion with the appropriate enzymes. The PTPS-IIRn gene (NP_058916.1) was subcloned from pSTV28MPS 67 into pUC19 68 using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The VNG6306 gene (NP_395805.1) was amplified from the Halobacterium sp. NRC1 genomic DNA using primers HsQueD_NdeI_Fw and HsQueD_Bl- pI_Rev bearing NdeI and BlpI and cloned into pJAM202 69 after digestion with appropriate enzymes. The HVO_1282 (YP_003535334.1) gene was amplified from the H. volcanii DS70 genomic DNA using primers HvPTPSIV_NdeI_Fw and HvPTPSIV_BlpI_Rev bearing NdeI and BlpI and cloned into pJAM202 after digestion with the appropriate enzymes. The SSO2412 (NP_353770.1) and Pcal_1063 (YP_001055954.1) genes were amplified from genomic DNA from S. solfataricus and P. calidifontis respectively using primers SsQueD2QHGH_Fw and SsQueD2QHGH_Rev bearing NcoI and BamHI restriction sites for SSO2412 and PcQueD2WHGH_Fw and PcQueD2WHGH_Rev bearing NcoI and BamHI restriction sites for Pcal_1063. The obtained PCR fragments were cloned into pBAD24 after digestion with appropriate enzymes.  Site directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously66 using the specific oligonucleotides pairs listed in Supplemental Table 4. The resulting plasmids were verified by Sanger sequencing at the U of F core facility.  The ygcM::Kanr deletion was transferred by P1 transduction70 from the E. coli JW2735-2 strain from the Keio collection71 into E. coli K12 MG1655. The Kanr marker was then excised using the Flp to create the ygcM strain (VDC2043). The recombinase72 folB::Kanr deletion was transferred by P1 transduction70 from the E. coli JW3030-2 strain from the Keio collection71 into E. coli K12 MG1655 yielding strain VDC3276. Deletion of both folB and ygcM and excision of the Kanr gene were confirmed by PCR. The H. volcanii HVO_1718 deletion strain was constructed as described previ- ously.42 The H. volcanii HVO_1282 and HVO_1284 strains were constructed as previously described.38 Deletions of the genes were checked by PCR as shown in Supplemental Figure 3.  Cloning and Expression of the M. jannaschii MJ1272 Gene. The M. jannaschii gene MJ1272 (NP_248268.1) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA by using oligonucleotide primers. The primers used were MJ1272-Fwd and MJ1272-Rev. PCR amplification was performed using a 55 C as annealing temperature. The PCR product was purified by using a QIAquick spin column and digested with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes and then ligated into compatible sites in plasmid pT7-7 to make the recombinant plasmid pMJ1272. DNA sequence was verified by dye-terminator sequencing at the DNA Facility of Iowa University. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E.coli strain BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL. The transformed cells were grown in LuriaBertani medium supplemented with 100 g mL1 Amp at 37 C with shaking until they reached an OD600 of 1.0. Recombinant protein production was induced by addition of lactose to a final concentration of 28 mM. After an additional 2 h of culture, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000  g, 5 min) and frozen at 20 C. E. coli cells expressing recombinant protein were resuspended in 4 mL of extraction buffer (50 mM N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES) pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM DTT) and lysed by sonication. After precipitating the majority of E. coli proteins by heating the cell lysate to 80 C for 10 min, the MJ1272 derived protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ HR column (1 cm  8 cm, Amersham Bioscience) with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl in 25 mM TES pH 7.5 over 55 at 1 mL min1. The purified protein ran as a single band at approximately 18 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular weight of 18.8 kDa, and was >98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford analysis.73  Enzyme Assay of M. jannaschii MJ1272. The standard assay for MJ1272 consisted of 515 g MJ1272, 25 mM TES/K+ buffer pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, and 1.0 mM substrate (sepiapterin, H2neopterin, H2neopterin-P) in a total volume of 50 L. When required, 2 mM Fe2+ was also included in the incubation mixture. For assays utilizing H2neopterin 2,3-cyclic phosphate, 1.9 g MptA, 2 mM MnCl2, and 2 mM GTP were also included in the incubation mixture.47 The product of the MptA reaction was confirmed by the absorbance using a diode array detector. 6-Carboxypterin was also confirmed by the formation of the methyl ester with HCl/methanol and reanalysis by HPLC. To test the involvement of cysteine in the reaction MJ1272 (10 g) was preincubated in reaction buffer with 2 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at RT and then assayed for activity with sepiapterin as the substrate according to the standard assay procedures. Assays were typically incubated for 30 min at 70 C and quenched by the addition of 60 L of methanol. Reaction products were oxidized to the fluorescent pterins by addition of 5 L of iodine in MeOH (50 mg mL1), and the samples were incubated at RT for 30 min. Excess iodine was reduced by addition of 5 L of 1 M NaHSO3. Following centrifugation (14,000  g, 10 min), a 4 L portion was separated for TLC analysis, and the remainder was combined with 600 L of H2O for HPLC analysis. For samples incubated with D2O, 50% of the water in the incubation mixture was replaced with D2O.  Chromatographic separation and analysis of pterins was performed on a Shimadzu HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) System with a C18 reverse phase column (Varian PursuitXRs 250 mm  4.6 mm, 5 m partical size). The elution profile consisted of 5 min at 95% sodium acetate buffer (25 mM, pH 6.0, 0.02% NaN3) and 5% MeOH followed by a linear gradient to 20% sodium acetate buffer/ 80% MeOH over 40 min at 0.5 mL/min. Pterins were detected by fluorescence using an excitation wavelength of 356 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. Under these conditions, the pterins were eluted in the following order (min): D-neopterin 2,3-cyclic phosphate (7.6), 6-carboxypterin (8.4), neopterin (11.0), pterin (16.8), 6-hydroxymethylpterin (16.8), and 6,7-dimethylpterin (27.0). The pterins were also identified by TLC (thin layer chromatography) with fluorescence detection. The following Rf were observed using acetonitrile/water/formic acid (88%), 40:10:5 v/v/v as the developing solvent: pterin-6-carboxylate methyl ester, 0.63; pterin, 0.465; 6- hydroxymethylpterin, 0.45; biopterin, 0.44; neopterin, 0.31; and pterin-6-carboxylate, 0.24.     In order to separate 6-hydroxymethylpterin from pterin a polyfluorophenyl column (Varian Pursuit-PFP column 250 mm  4.6 mm, 5 m) was used with the HPLC system. The elution profile was isocratic 25 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 6.0 over 45 min at 0.5 mL min1. With these conditions pterin eluted at 27 min and 6- hydroxymethylpterin at 29 min.  For GCMS analysis, pterins were purified from incubation mixtures by retention on a Dowex 50W-8X-H+column followed by elution with 7 M aqueous ammonia. Pterins was analyzed for deuterium incorporation either by direct insertion (DI) mass spectral of the pterin, M+ = 163 m/z or by DI or GCMS analysis of the pterin (TMS)2 derivative with M+ = 307 m/z and M+  15 = 292 m/z. For the GCMS analysis of the pterins, the individual pterins were purified by preparative TLC from the ammonia eluted material and analyzed as their TMS derivatives as previously described.74    Enzyme Assays of E. coli QueD. The ygcM gene from E. coli, which encodes QueD (PTPS-I), was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA using primers ECygcmS and ECygcmAS and cloned using ligation-independent cloning into the plasmid pET30-Xa (Novagen) following the manufacturers instructions. The integrity of the sequence was confirmed by sequencing (PSU-Keck Genomics Facility, Portland State University). Recombinant QueD was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) using standard protocols, purified as an N-terminal His6-affinity tagged fusion protein via Ni-NTA affinity chromatog- raphy, and then cleaved via Factor Xa to give the native wild-type enzyme.  Assays of recombinant E. coli QueD activity were carried out in reactions containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.5 mM 7,8-dihydroneopterin monophosphate (H2NMP), and 50 M QueD, and were monitored by LCESI-MS at 360 nm. Coupled reactions involving GCYH-IB (50 M) from N. gonorrheae, 50 M QueD, and 0.5 mM GTP were also carried out. Reactions were incubated at 37 C for 60 min in the dark under anaerobic conditions. The protein was removed from the solution using a YM-10 m centrifugal device, and the eluent subjected to LC ESI-MS analysis on a Bruker MicroTOF-Q equipped with a Supelco Discovery C18 column (25 cm  2.1 mm, 5 m particles) eluted at 0.3 mL min1 with a solvent gradient of 5% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) for 5 min, then 550% of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) in 25 min.  tRNA Extraction and Analysis. Bulk tRNA was prepared, hydrolyzed, and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCESIMS/MS) as described in ref 75 from cells grown in chemically defined medium. To evaluate tRNA concen- trations, we measured the levels of the m1G-modified base (298 m/z at 21 min) by integrating the peak area from the extraction ion chromatograms and compared them between samples. The MS/MS fragmentation data were also used to confirm the presence or absence of the nucleosides, Q and G+. All tRNA extractions and analysis were performed at least twice independently.

The analysis of our simulations, carried out by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) poten- tials, shows that the reaction takes place through a DNAN or dissociative mechanism, the same mechanism employed by AP in the hydrolysis of monoesters. The promiscuous activity observed in this superfamily can be then explained on the basis of a conserved reaction mechanism. According to our simulations the specialization in the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters or phosphodiesters, developed in dierent members of the superfamily, is a consequence of the interactions established between the protein and the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group and, in particular, with the oxygen atom that bears the additional alkyl group when the substrate is a diester. A water molecule, belonging to the coordination shell of the Mg2 ion, and residue Lys328 seem to play decisive roles stabilizing a phosphomonoester substrate, but the latter contributes to increase the energy barrier for the hydrolysis of phosphodiesters. Then, mutations aecting the nature or positioning of Lys328 lead to an increased diesterase activity in AP. Finally, the capacity of this enzymatic family to catalyze the reaction of phosphoesters having dierent leaving groups, or substrate promiscuity, is explained by the ability of the enzyme to stabilize dierent charge distributions in the leaving group using dierent interactions involving either one of the zinc centers or residues placed on the outer side of the catalytic site.  1. INTRODUCTION  Enzyme families can be grouped into evolutionarily related superfamilies. Frequently, members of a given superfamily have the ability to catalyze reactions of their evolutionary relatives.14 These promiscuous activities provide new opportunities not only for de- signing new synthetic methodologies but also to test mechanistic hypotheses or the role of particular residues in a reaction and to understand the way followed by evolution to recruit and specialize enzymes for new functions. Structural similarities and promiscuous activities can be vestiges of evolutionary events with a common ancestor displaying broader catalytic activity.5  The alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily is a group of en- zymes that catalyzes phosphoryl transfer reactions. This is a funda- mental reaction in biochemical processes including energy storage, biosynthesis, or replication of genetic material.610 Moreover, transphosphorylations are key regulatory mechanisms in cellular signaling.11 Members of this group of enzymes include phospho- monoesterases, phosphodiesterases, phosphoglycerate mutases, phosphopentomutases, and sulfatases.1216 AP, the best character- ized member of the superfamily, catalyzes phosphate monoesters hydrolysis, but it also shows secondary activity catalyzing phospho- diesters and related compounds.5,16,17 A highly related member of  this superfamily is the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodies- terase (NPP), an enzyme catalyzing phosphodiester hydrolysis,18,19 but it also has secondary activity as phosphomonoesterase20 and sulfatase.21 Active sites of both AP and NPP have a clear structural relationship as can be seen in Figure 1. These sites contain two zinc ions and a deprotonated serine or threonine acting as a nucleophile. A prominent dierence between AP and NPP is the presence of a third metallic ion in the former, a magnesium ion (Mg2 ) that could play a fundamental role in the discrimination between phos- phate monoesters and diesters.22 This ion was initially proposed to play a fundamental role in the deprotonation of the nucleo- phile.23,24 However, the absence of this third ion in NPP and the lack of any other candidate to act as general base in this enzyme led to a reexamination of its role.22 Recent studies with the E322Y mutant of E. coli AP in which one of the ligands of the magnesium ion was mutated, losing then the ability to bound this ion, showed that the absence of this metal center does not inactivate the enzyme completely.22 This observation strongly suggests that the magne- sium ion does not mediate general base catalysis. In addition, the  Received:  February 25, 2011  Published:May24,2011r2011AmericanChemicalSociety12050dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2017575|J.Am.Chem.Soc.2011,133,1205012062ARTICLEpubs.acs.org/JACSFigure 1. Schematic representation of the putative TS of the phosphomonoester and phosphodiester hydrolysis in the active sites of Escherichia coli AP (A) and Xanthomonoas axonopodis pv. citri NPP (B).  E322Y mutant showed a slightly increased activity with diesters, which oers an excellent opportunity to rationalize the speci city dierences between monoesterases and diesterases of the AP superfamily.22  Obviously, the role of the dierent constituents of the active sites must be established on the basis of the most accepted reaction mechanisms. In principle, phosphoester hydrolysis may proceed through dissociative or loose transition state (TS) structures, in which there is an advanced bond cleavage to the leaving group but no bond formation to the nucleophile, or through more associative or tight transition states (TSs), in which there is bond formation to the nucleophile and no bond cleavage to the leaving group.8,25,26 Experimental studies14,27 have established that AP catalyzes phosphomonoester hydrolysis through a dissociative or DNAN mechanism.14,27 However, an analysis of kinetic isotope eects (KIEs) and linear free energy relationships (LFERs) found that the nature of the TS of AP catalyzed phosphodiester hydrolysis was more probably associative.28 These studies then suggested that the AP enzyme is able to recognize and stabilize dierent TS's. The active site would be then exible enough to be adapted to the characteristics of the chemical system, avoiding the energy penalty associated to a change in the nature of the TS.5 However, the other way around has been also proposed to explain the promiscuous activity of related enzymes. In particular the promiscuous activity of protein phosphatase-1 with phosphonates has been explained on the basis of a mechanistic change when going from solution to the active site; this is assuming an evolutionary scenario in which the chemical system is adapted to the protein environment.29  In general, theoretical simulations of reaction processes are needed to determine the reaction mechanism in a more con- clusive way. This is particularly interesting for the case of the phosphoester hydrolysis, where the interpretation of experimen- tal data can be ambiguous due to the inherent diculties associated to the at nature of the free energy surface associated to these processes.25 Methods based on hybrid quantum me- chanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) potentials3033 are a powerful tool for studying chemical reactions in condensed phases such as solutions and enzyme active sites. In previous studies, we carried out QM/MM theoretical simulations of the AP activity with a benzyl phosphomonoester (m-nitrobenzyl phosphate or mNBP) nding that the chemical step is dissocia- tive and stepwise. The breaking between the phosphorus and the leaving group was found to be the rate-limiting step,34 in agreement with the interpretation of experimental data.12  However, our recent theoretical simulations on a phosphodiester (methyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate or MpNPP) alkaline hydro- lysis in aqueous solution and in the active site of NPP indicate that most probably a mechanistic change occurs when the system goes from one environment to another. Eectively, while the TS seems to be clearly associative in solution,35 a dissociative mech- anism is identied in the NPP active site.36 Simulations show that electrostatic interactions in solution favor tight structures be- cause the solvent reaction eld reduces the repulsion between the negatively charged reacting species (nucleophile and substrate). Instead, the electrostatic features of the NPP active site stabilize the charge distribution of dissociative TS structures, in accor- dance with the structural similarity between AP and NPP active sites. Thus, our QM/MM studies would support a picture of evolution of the AP superfamily in which the reaction mechanism is maintained for dierent substrates.  If the reaction mechanism is the same for dierent members of the superfamily, then the question is now how the dierent specicities of AP and NPP for a particular substrate, phospho- monoesters or phosphodiesters, is attained. According to Hers- chlag and co-workers,20,22 substrate specicity could be due to functional contacts to the substrate rather than from dierences in the properties of the bimetallic site, which could induce changes in the reaction mechanism.36 The main purpose of this paper is to investigate into the promiscuous ability of the AP enzyme to catalyze both the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters and to rationalize the origin of the pre- ference for the formers. We will analyze the hydrolysis reaction of a phosphodiester (methyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate diester, MpNPP) in the active site of AP, and the results will be compared with those obtained for the same substrate in NPP and for a phosphomonoester (m-nitrobenzylphosphate, mNBP) in AP. We will also show the results obtained for the same substrate in dierent AP mutants, including the E322Y AP mutant. We anticipate as a general conclusion that, in agreement with the predictions of Herschlag and co-workers, enzyme interactions with phosphate oxygen atoms play a decisive role to develop enzyme specicity within the AP superfamily.  2. METHODOLOGY  2.1. Wild Type Alkaline Phosphatase Models. The starting point for the study of the phosphodiesterase activity of AP was taken from our previous simulations on the hydrolysis of mNBP in this enzyme.34 Details of the procedure followed are described elsewhere.34  12051dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2017575|J.Am.Chem.Soc.2011,133,1205012062JournaloftheAmericanChemicalSocietyARTICLEBriefly, the X-ray crystal structure of E. coli AP with Protein Data Bank code 1ALK23 was used as the starting geometry for the simulations. This structure is a homodimer with two active sites, both containing inorganic phosphate. The inorganic phosphate of one of the active sites was re- placed by the substrate molecule (mNBP) while the other was kept empty. The protonation state of titatrable residues was calculated using the cluster method37,38 assuming pH = 8, which is the optimum value for AP,39 and verified using the PROPKA program.40,41 We solvated the system with a water molecule sphere of 40  radius centered on the phosphorus atom of the substrate. Water molecules placed at less than 2.8  from any other non-hydrogen atom of the system were deleted. We defined as flexible all of those atoms belonging to residues or molecules found at a distance less or equal to 22  of the phosphorus atom. The system was then optimized and equilibrated by means of the combina- tion of steepest-descent and conjugate gradient optimizations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  In the present work a structure corresponding to the reactant state of mNBP hydrolysis was used as a template to model the reactant state of MpNPP hydrolysis. This phosphodiester was placed into the active site overlapping the phosphate groups with the uncharged oxygen atom bearing the methyl group (O3 in Figure 1A) oriented toward the Mg2 site in agreement with the conclusions obtained by Herschlag and co- workers on the basis of their analysis of the reactivity of dierent en- antiomers of a phosphorothioate diester.22  As found in our previous theoretical study in AP, a large QM sub- system is needed to reproduce the charge-transfer eects between the reactive system and the neighboring residues.34 The QM region contains the Ser102 residue, the Arg166 residue, the Lys328 residue, the substrate (MpNPP), the two zinc ions, and their coordination spheres (Asp51, Asp369, His370, Asp327, His331, His412) (see Figure 1A). Because of the small size of the serine side chain, we included part of the previous and next residues of the protein sequence (Asp101 and Ala103) in the QM region. To saturate the valence of the QM/MM frontier we used the link atoms procedure,42,43 placing these link atoms between the CR and C atoms of each residue, except for residues Asp101 and Ala103 where the link atom was placed between the carbonyl carbon and CR atoms. The number of QM atoms was 139. As in previous studies,3436,44,45 we used the semiempirical Hamiltonian AM1/d-PhoT (hereafter simply named as AM1d)44 to describe the QM region. This Hamiltonian incorporates d-extension for the phosphorus atom and modied AM1 parameters for oxygen and hydrogen atoms, while the remaining atoms are described at the AM1 level. The MM region was described by means of the OPLS-AA46,47 and TIP3P48 potentials as implemented in the fDYNAMO library.49  This system was then optimized, combining steepest-descent and conjugate gradient steps. The total system consists of 30 190 atoms, of which 21 924 atoms were kept frozen during all of the subsequent simulations (those belonging to residues or molecules placed more than 22  away of the phosphorus atom). A switched cuto, from 14 to 16 , was employed for all nonbonded MM interactions (including the frozen atoms), while the QM region was allowed to interact with every exible MM atom. MD simulations were performed in the reactant state to warm up the system from 0 to 300 K. Finally, the system was equilibrated at 300 K using the NVT ensemble and the LangevinVerlet integrator with a time step of 1 fs. The total simulation time employed to equilibrate the system was 300 ps. All of the QM/MM calculations were carried out using fDYNAMO.49  2.2. Alkaline Phosphatase Mutants. We also study the MpNPP hydrolysis in the active site of the E322Y AP mutant using the crystal structure with Protein Data Bank code 3DYC22 as the starting geometry for the simulations. The protonation state of titratable residues at pH = 8 was determined using the PROPKA program.40,41 The protein was solvated with a water molecule sphere of 40  radius centered on the phosphorus atom of the substrate, and the flexible region was defined  containing all of the atoms of residues or molecules within a sphere of 22  radius centered on the phosphorus atom. The total system, which contains 30 259 atoms, of which 21 934 were kept frozen, was optimized by means of the combination of steepest-descent and conjugate gradient optimizations and warmed up to 300 K with a series of MD simulations. Finally, the system was equilibrated at 300 K using the NVT ensemble and the LangevinVerlet integrator with a time step of 1 fs during a total simulation time of 300 ps.  Comparing the active sites of AP and NPP, other mutations of resi- dues of the AP active site were proposed to improve its secondary ac- tivity as phosphodiesterase. The rst mutant was designed replacing Lys328 of wild type AP (WT AP) by a tyrosine (K328Y AP), while a second one was designed replacing Lys328 by a tyrosine in the active site of the E322Y AP mutant (E322Y/K328Y AP). The same protocol described above was followed. The equilibration time in these mutants was longer (500 ps) to allow the system to relax after introducing the mutation in the X-ray structures of WT AP and E322Y AP mutant.  In all of the mutants, the QM region was dened as described above, using the AM1d Hamiltonian, whereas the rest of the system was treated by means of the OPLS-AA and TIP3P force elds. The total number of QM atoms was 139 when residue 328 is a lysine and 138 when this residue is replaced by tyrosine.  2.3. Potentials of Mean Force. To analyze the energetics of the chemical reaction, we performed the potential of mean force (PMF)50 in all of the systems previously prepared at a reference temperature of 300 K. The antisymmetric combination of the distances describing the breaking and forming bonds [d(POlg)  d(POnuc), see Figure 1A for atom labeling] was employed as the distinguished reaction coordi- nate (RC). The umbrella sampling approach51 was used to constraint the system close to a particular value of the reaction coordinate by means of the addition of a harmonic potential with a force constant of 2. The probability distributions, obtained from a MD 2500 kJ 3 mol simulation within each individual window, are put together by means of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM)52 to obtain the full probability distribution along the reaction coordinate. Each window consisted of 10 ps of equilibration followed by 15 ps of production. The total number of windows employed to cover the whole range of the reaction coordinate in all of the enzymatic systems were around 200, with small variations in each enzymatic system.  1 3   As in our previous study,36 we also performed a two-dimensional PMF (2D-PMF) for the MpNPP hydrolysis in the AP active site to verify the associative/dissociative nature of the reaction mechanism obtained from the one-dimensional PMF. The 2D-PMF at a reference temp- erature of 300 K was performed as a function of the two distances corresponding to the breaking and forming bonds (d(POlg) and (POnuc)) treated independently. We employed 630 windows to generate the 2D-PMF, and each window consisted of 10 ps of equilibra- tion and 15 ps of production. The force constant applied to both distances was 2000 kJ 3 mol  1 3   2.  2.4. Comparison between Theoretical and Experimental Free Energy Barriers. The comparison of experimental and theore- tical kinetic data is particularly complicated in this superfamily. Inorganic phosphate, the product of the hydrolysis reaction, is a very efficient inhibitor of the enzymatic activity. This effect is the origin of the poor agreement between the kinetic constants (kcat and KM) determined in independent studies where saturating concentrations of inorganic phos- phate were required to have appreciable changes upon hydrolysis.39 Well-converged values of kinetic constants were determined only after the development of high sensitivity 32P-based methods, able to work below the range where product inhibition occurs.39 Unfortunately, under saturation conditions only kcat/KM can be measured. This provides the free energy barrier as measured from the ground state of the free enzyme ), while theoretical simulations are carried and substrate in solution (GE out from the substrate-enzyme Michaelis complex, providing a different  12052dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2017575|J.Am.Chem.Soc.2011,133,1205012062JournaloftheAmericanChemicalSocietyARTICLEScheme 1  Figure 3. Averaged values of the POnuc and POlg distances found during the reaction PMFs for the alkaline hydrolysis of MpNPP in solution (blue), in the NPP active site (red), and in the WT AP active site (black) projected on the 2D-PMF obtained for the latter. The arrows point to the TS locations.  designed by evolution to stabilize the charge distribution of a dissociative TS.  In this work, we have carried out the simulations correspond- ing to the hydrolysis of MpNPP in the AP active site. We ob- tained a one-dimensional PMF using the antisymmetric combi- nation of the distances from the phosphorus atom to the nuc- leophile and from the phosphorus atom to the leaving group [RC = d(POlg)  d(POnuc)]. The resulting free energy prole, together with those previously obtained in aqueous solution and in NPP active site, is presented in Figure 2. The shape of the free energy prole is quite similar to that obtained in NPP: it presents a plateau around the TS region, while the prole in solution displays a bell-shaped curve. This dierence is attri- buted to a change in the mechanism, from associative in aqueous solution to dissociative in both enzymatic active sites. Reaction mechanisms can be analyzed by means of the averaged POlg and POnuc distances obtained along the free energy proles, as shown in Figure 3. These averaged distances have been drawn on the 2D-PMF obtained for the AP enzymatic reaction, as de- scribed in the previous section. This gure conrms the fact that the reaction mechanism in solution is associative, while it is disso- ciative in the two enzymatic active sites. Initially, the reaction is described, in all environments, as an approach of the nucleophile to the phosphorus atom while the leaving group remains strongly bonded. In aqueous solution the reaction continues without appreciable changes in the POlg distance until the formation of a transient compact pentacoordinated structure with distances to the leaving and nucleophilic oxygen atoms of about 1.9 . The bond between the phosphorus atom and the leaving group oxygen atom is broken only after this tight structure is formed. In both AP and NPP enzymes, the reaction proceeds in a com- pletely dierent way; the cleavage of the POlg bond begins in a much earlier stage of the reaction, in such a way that the system reaches regions where both distances (POnuc and POlg) correspond to nearly broken bonds (around 2.8 ), forming a transient tricoordinated structure. Once the new POnuc bond has been formed, the distance between the phosphorus atom and the leaving group increases again. The 2D-PMF conrms this  Figure 2.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  3.1. Reaction Mechanisms of Phosphodiester Hydrolysis in AP. In previous studies we used the QM/MM methodology described before to investigate the reaction mechanisms of the alkaline hydrolysis of MpNPP in aqueous solution and in the active site of NPP.35,36 Our results showed a mechanistic change when going from aqueous solution to the NPP active site: a tight TS was obtained in solution while a much looser or dissociative TS was found in the enzyme. These differences where rationa- lized in terms of the very different nature of the electrostatic interactions established between the chemical system and the surroundings in these two environments. In aqueous solution the electric field acting on the system is a reaction field that essen- tially reduces the repulsion between the two negatively charged reaction fragments (the hydroxide anion and MpNPP) by a factor roughly equal to the dielectric constant. Then, if the electrostatic repulsion is diminished, chemical forces dominate the process, and an associative pathway is obtained. In the NPP active site the situation is quite different. There are no free rotating dipoles able to be adapted to any change in the charge distribution of the reacting fragment and to produce a reaction field. Instead, we have a much more permanent electric field  12053dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2017575|J.Am.Chem.Soc.2011,133,1205012062JournaloftheAmericanChemicalSocietyARTICLETable 1.

An associative ANDN pathway, as the one observed in solution, would cross through regions with higher free energies. According to these results, and assuming an equilibrium distribution, reactive trajectories cross- ing through the associative region of the 2D-surface would be much less probable than trajectories across the region dening the dissociative mechanism.  Averaged distances from the phosphorus atom to the nucleo- phile and the leaving group for the TS's and the reactants are provided in Table 1 for the three proles. The geometries of the TS's, in particular the value of the sum of the bond distances from the phosphorus atom to the nucleophile and leaving group oxygen atoms, conrm the dierent nature of the reaction mech- anism in solution and in the enzymes. This is further conrmed from the analysis of the Pauling bond orders53 of the phosphorus atom to the oxygen atoms of the leaving group and the nucleo- phile at the TS. In aqueous solution these bond orders are 0.83 and 0.46, respectively; for the reaction in NPP we obtained 0.32 and 0.14, and for the reaction catalyzed by AP we obtained 0.17 and 0.29. That is, the sum of the TS bond orders is larger than one in aqueous solution (1.29) and lower than one for the re- action in NPP and AP (0.46 in both cases), conrming the associative nature of the mechanism in solution and the disso- ciative mechanism in the enzymes.  The free energy barrier ordering obtained from the monodimen- 1 for sional PMF agrees with the expected behavior: 20.5 kcal 3 mol 1 for the reaction in the aqueous solution reaction, 13.5 kcal 3 mol 1 for the reaction in NPP. That is, the value AP, and 8.9 kcal 3 mol obtained for the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester in AP is in between the free energy barriers of the uncatalyzed process and the reaction catalyzed by its natural enzyme: AP catalyzes the hydro- lysis of phosphodiesters but less eciently than NPP. It must be noted that the AM1d/MM methodology employed here has been shown to produce slightly underestimated free energy barriers.35,36 The predicted activation free energy in aqueous solution is in reasonable agreement with the activation free energy derived from application of TS theory to the experimental rate constant mea- 1.5 With respect to the sured in solution at 42 C, 25.9 kcal 3 mol enzymatic process, the calculated free energy barrier for the re- 1 lower than in AP (see Table 1), action in NPP is 4.6 kcal 3 mol which seems a reasonable estimation according to the experimental observation of a faster reaction in the former than in the latter. Moreover, the free energy barrier estimated using the same QM/MM methodology for the departure of the leaving group in the stepwise mechanism of mNBP hydrolysis in AP was 1 lower than for Mp- 10.2 kcal 3 mol  1,34 which is 3.3 kcal 3 mol  NPP, in agreement with the fact that AP is a better monoesterase than diesterase. The experimental second-order rate constants (kcat/KM) for the enzymatic reaction of mNBP and MpNPP in the presence of AP (1.8 107 and 18 M 1, respectively)22 can be translated to a free energy barrier dierence (estimated from free enzyme and substrate) using the following relationship:  1 3 s  G E   G  E, MpNPP   G  E, mNBP    RT ln  MpNPP  the free energy barrier GE  mNBP2 According to eq 2 and using the experimentally determined  is reduced by rate constants, 1 when going from the diester to the monoester. If 8.2 kcal 3 mol we assume a more negative binding free energy for mNBP, which is the specic substrate of AP (this is, GBind = GBind,MpNPP  GBind,mNBP > 0), then the value provided by eq 2 should be an upper limit for the free energy barrier dierence estimated from  , see eq 1), in agreement with the the Michaelis complex (Gcat result of our simulations.       kcat KM kcat KM  3  3 O    Figure 4 shows representative snapshots of the reactant state corresponding to the MpNPP and mNBP hydrolysis in AP and averaged values of some signicant distances.54 The MpNPP molecule was placed into the active site with the uncharged oxygen atom of the phosphate group (the one bearing the methyl group, O3) oriented toward the Mg2 site, following the con- clusions of Herschlag and co-workers.22 We tried dierent conformations for the methyl group, rotating around the PO- 0 ) bond. In all cases we found that the methyl group was nally (R placed as shown in Figure 4. This methyl group is placed in such a way that establishes a CH 3 hydrogen bond with the nucleophilic oxygen atom of Ser102. This kind of hydrogen-bond interaction has been documented for other systems, and it has been well-characterized with theoretical methods.55,56 We checked the performance of the AM1d Hamiltonian to treat these interactions comparing the results obtained for a model system (H3CH 3 calculations: M062X57 and MP258,59 with the 6-311G(2df,2p) basis 3 O distance and the interaction energies obtained set.

Lys328 shows also a stabilizing con- tact with the oxygen atom bearing the methyl group (O3). Ob- viously, these interactions are much stronger in the case of a monoester since the negative charges on the oxygen atoms are larger. As shown in Table 2 the averaged Mulliken charges on the oxygen atom interacting with Zn(I) (O1) are 1.07 and 0.51 a.u. for the reactant states of mNBP and MpNPP, respectively. The corresponding charges on the oxygen atom interacting with the Ser102 amide group (O2) are 1.15 and 1.01 au, respectively. Finally the charges on O3 are 1.10 and 0.55 au for mNBP and MpNPP, respectively. This oxygen atom interacts in both cases with Lys328, but the averaged hydrogen bond distance is shorter for mNBP than for MpNPP (2.12 and 2.41 , respectively, see Figure 4). In the case of the mono- ester this oxygen atom also presents a hydrogen bond interaction with one water molecule belonging to the coordination shell of the Mg2 center. This is one of the three structural water molecules, present in the X-ray structure,23 that complete the coordination shell of the ion. These water molecules remain coordinated to the ion during all of the simulations. This interaction is not observed in the reactant state of MpNPP, where the water molecule interacts with Asp153, which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to Lys328. In the reactant state of mNBP, Asp153 is hydrogen-bonded to Arg166, not shown in Figure 4. Thus, and in agreement with the hypothesis of Herschlag and co-workers,22 functional contacts to the substrate dierent to the bimetallic site contribute to the specicity dierence between AP and  Figure 5. Representative snapshot of the TS for the MpNPP hydrolysis in the active site of AP. Averaged distances are given in angstroms ().  NPP. According to our structures, it seems that interactions with phosphate oxygen atoms, and in particular the dierences observed when one of these oxygen atoms bears or not an alkyl group, could be determinants in understanding the preference of AP for phospho- monoesters. Finally, hydrogen bonds are also established between two oxygen atoms of the phosphate group in MpNPP and Arg166 (see Figure 1A and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), but these hydrogen bonds are also observed in the case of the phosphomonoester.34 Figure 4 also shows the distances of some residues involved in the coordination of the Mg2 that will be important when analyzing the behavior of the E322Y mutant (see below).  Interactions contributing to the relative stabilization of the TS of MpNPP hydrolysis in AP can be identied comparing the ave- raged structure of the TS (see Figure 5) with that of the reactant state (Figure 4). The hydrogen bonds established between O2 and the amide group of Ser102 and between O3 and a water molecule of the coordination shell of the Mg2 ion are reinforced when going from the reactant state to the TS. The rst hydrogen bond is stronger than the second at the TS, not only because the distance is shorter (1.98  and 2.37 , respectively) but also because the averaged charge on the O2 atom is larger, in absolute  12055dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2017575|J.Am.Chem.Soc.2011,133,1205012062JournaloftheAmericanChemicalSocietyARTICLEi refers to the residues. The interaction energy of a particular residue with the reacting system was computed over 100 evenly spaced structures saved from a 100 ps QM/MM MD simulation in the reactant and transition states. The interaction energy includes both electrostatic and van der Waals terms. The elec- trostatic interactions are calculated treating the residues as a col- lection of point charges obtained either from the force eld (if they belong to the MM subsystem) or from a Mulliken an- alysis (if they were originally included in the QM subsystem), while the reacting fragments are described at the AM1d level. The contribution of the interaction energy of each residue to the energy barrier is depicted in Figure 6. A negative value means that the interaction energy with this residue contributes to reduce the energy barrier, and a positive value means that contributes to increase it. It should be taken into account that the interaction energy with the reacting fragment does not provide the complete contribution of a given residue to the energy barrier, as far as it can also make a contribution through the interactions with other enzymatic fragments in the reactant and TS. Anyway, the quan- tities presented in Figure 6A may be useful to understand the catalytic properties of AP with MpNPP. The residues providing a more negative contribution of the interaction energy to the bar- rier are Arg166 and Lys167. The rst is able to interact with two of the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group (O2 and O3), and this interaction is strengthened at the TS (see the evolution of the charges in Table 2). Lys167 is placed at the outer side of the active site and establishes a strong electrostatic interaction with the nitro group at the TS that presents an averaged Mulliken charge of 0.84 a.u. A gure showing the positioning of Arg166 and Lys167 at the reactants and TS together with the coordinates of the substrate and the most relevant residues for these two structures in PDB format are provided as Supporting Informa- tion (Figure S1). Other residues appearing with large negative contributions in Figure 6 are Asp51, Lys91, Asp153, Lys177, and Lys209. Their contributions can be rationalized in terms of the charge transfer taking place from the nucleophile to the leaving group and the large charge separation attained at the TS. The residue with the largest positive contribution, and then increasing the energy barrier, is Lys328. As mentioned before, this residue presents a hydrogen-bond interaction with the oxygen atom O3 at the reactant state, while it is confronted to the methyl group at the TS. Other residues making important positive contributions through the interaction energy are Asp97, Glu411, His412, and the metallic centers Zn(II) and Mg2 . The Zn(II) and Mg2 centers electrostatically stabilize the nucleophile in the reactant state. At the TS the charge separation in the reacting subsystem is larger, and then the net electrostatic eect of these two metallic centers is positive. It must be taken into account that the leaving group is able to delocalize the charge through the -electronic system and the nitro group, and then the leaving group oxygen atom (Olg) does not support a very large negative charge. This eect would also explain the small interaction energy contribu- tion to decrease the barrier of the Zn(I) center. There are several points to be stressed when analyzing these data. First, as said before, the interaction energy is not the whole contribution of each residue (or metallic center) to the energy barrier. Second, in this analysis we are not considering the binding energy step, since we compare the TS to the Michaelis complex. Finally, it seems that AP is able to stabilize TS's using dierent strate- gies depending on the nature of the leaving group. So, when the substrate is MpNPP, the leaving group is able to delocalize the charge, and then Lys167 can play an important role in TS  Figure 6. Averaged contribution of the interaction energy of each residue with the reacting system (ser102  substrate) to the energy barrier of the MpNPP (A) and mNBP (B) hydrolysis in the active site of AP. Residues are ordered according to the sequence, and the metallic centers were added at the end.  value, than the charge of the O3 oxygen atom (0.99 a.u. and 0.74 a.u., respectively, as seen in Table 2). An important dierence of the TS structure with respect to the reactant structure is the position of the methyl group. In the course of the reaction the phosphate group must be inverted and then the methyl group must break the interaction established with the nucleophilic oxygen atom. In addition, during the inversion process the methyl group is confronted to Lys328, which loses the interaction with the O3 oxygen atom. As discussed below, this interaction between the chemical system and Lys328 stabilizes the reactant state relatively to the TS, increasing the energy barrier of the diester hydrolysis. The position of Lys328 is held by means of a strong hydrogen bond established with Asp153, which, as explained before, is also hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule of the coordination shell of the Mg2  ion and to Arg166.  To get a deeper insight into the impact of these and other residues in the catalytic activity of the enzyme, we computed the averaged contribution to the energy barrier of the interaction energy of each residue with the reacting system (Ser102 plus the MpNPP). This contribution is calculated as the dierence of the interaction established in the transition and reactant state:  E  int, i  TS    Eint, i  3 where TS and RS denote averages over the transition and reactant states of the reaction, respectively, and the subscript   Eint, i  RS  12056dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2017575|J.Am.Chem.Soc.2011,133,1205012062JournaloftheAmericanChemicalSocietyARTICLEScheme 2  stabilization and not the Zn(I) ion. Instead, when the substrate has a worse leaving group, such as in the case of the hydrolysis of the mNBP monoester34 or of the methyl phenyl phosphate die- ster,36 Zn(I) can play a major role stabilizing the TS's, since the charge cannot be eciently delocalized on the leaving group, and then a large fraction of this charge is now localized on the Olg atom at the TS, as seen in Table 2. This is conrmed in the an- alysis of the interaction energies carried out for the hydrolysis of mNBP in AP, shown in Figure 6B. In this case the contributions of the interaction energy of both Zn centers with the reacting systems are negative (24.8 and 11.5 kcal 3 mol 1 for Zn(I) and Zn(II), respectively), while the contribution of Lys167 is 1. Interestingly, these dierent strategies employed 1.6 kcal 3 mol by AP to interact with the charge distribution of dierent TS's (through specic interactions with the phosphate group oxygen atoms or the leaving group), explain the substrate promiscuity displayed by the AP. In fact, this enzyme is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphoesters with dierent leaving groups.5,12,22 Another interesting dierence between the contributions of the residues in the case of MpNPP and mNBP is found in Arg166. This residue plays a fundamental role in the binding process of the monoester, according to the interaction energy at the reactant state being 99.8 kcal 3 mol 1, larger, in absolute value, than for the diester (72.1 kcal 3 mol 1). However, because of the charge  delocalization found at the TS (see Table 2), the contribution to the barrier in the case of mNBP is positive (8.4 kcal 3 mol  1).  After reaching the TS, the hydrolysis reaction of MpNPP in AP continues when Ser102 and the methylphosphate group mutually approach to form the new POnuc bond. During this approach both the nucleophile and the methylphosphate group remain bound to the zinc centers (Zn(II) and Zn(I) respectively). In this way, the covalent enzymemethylphosphate intermediate ob- tained as a product of this reaction step is found in between the two zinc sites, as shown in Scheme 2 (E 3 P intermediate I).  3.2. Phosphodiester Hydrolysis in AP Mutants. Glu322 is one of the residues belonging to the coordination shell of the Mg2 ion in AP. In NPP, Tyr205 occupies the region correspond- ing to the Mg2 site (see Figure 1). Herschlag and co-workers prepared a mutant of AP with Glu322 replaced by tyrosine (E322Y AP). Since this mutant does not contain a Mg2 ion, the active site is closer to that of NPP. According to the structural changes, the E322Y mutation produced a differential effect on monoesters and diesters hydrolysis. The value of kcat/KM for the reaction of E322Y AP with MpNPP is slightly increased with 1 3 s 1 respect to the value determined for WT AP (35 and 18 M at 25 C, respectively) which can be converted into a free energy 1. ) of approximately 0.4 kcal 3 mol barrier lowering (GE Instead, the value of kcat/KM for the hydrolysis of mNBP is  12057dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2017575|J.Am.Chem.Soc.2011,133,1205012062JournaloftheAmericanChemicalSocietyARTICLETable 3.

Averaged distances are given in .  1 3 s  with Lys328 and displaces this residue from the neighborhood of the methyl group. It is important to point out that this interaction observed in our simulations between Lys328 and Asp51 is not found in the X-ray structure of the E322Y AP mutant.22 This enzyme is crystallized with an inorganic phosphate anion in the active site that establishes a water-mediated interaction with Lys328. This interaction is not observed when the diester is placed in the active site. Instead, Lys328 establishes a strong interaction with Asp51 in the E322Y mutant. The displacement of Lys328, together with the absence of the water molecules coordinated to the Mg2 ion, makes room in the active site to place the methyl group of MpNPP, especially at the TS when the phosphate group must be inverted. The consequence is a moderate reduction of the activation free energy as reected in the experimental rate constants and the calculated activation free energies. According to our interpretation of the results obtained for the E322Y AP mutant, the deletion of the Mg2 ion of the active site has direct and indirect consequences on the ability of the active site to catalyze the hydrolysis reaction. The direct eect is related to the absence of the coordination water molecules in the active site of the mutant. One of these water molecules plays an im- portant role stabilizing one of the nonbridging oxygen atoms of the monoester in the wild type enzyme (see Figure 1A). This would explain the considerable reduction of the monoestarase activity in the mutant.22 The calculated free energy prole associated to the breaking of the POlg bond of mNBP in the  of active site of the mutant shows a free energy barrier Gcat 1 higher than in WT AP 20.4 kcal 3 mol (see Supporting Information, Figure S3), in reasonable agreement  1; this is 10.0 kcal 3 mol  1 3 s  ) is increased by 7.9 kcal 3 mol  severely reduced from 1.8  107 M 1 in WT AP to 1 in the E322Y AP mutant. This dramatic reduction 35 M means that the free energy barrier measured from free enzyme 1. and substrate in solution (GE We obtained the corresponding PMF for the hydrolysis reaction of MpNPP in the active site of the E322Y AP mutant following the same protocol than for WT AP. The free energy  determined for barriers from the Michaelis complex, Gcat E322Y and WT AP and other mutants that will be analyzed below, are provided in Table 3. The free energy proles are given as Supporting Information (Figure S2).  These free energy barriers cannot be directly compared to the experimental values because they dier in the binding free energy. However, if the mutation does not drastically alter the binding free energy, then there should be a parallelism in the change of the free energy barriers measured from Michaelis complex or from free enzyme and substrate. This seems to be the  case for this enzyme: the value calculated for Gcat in E322Y 1 lower than the value mutant (Table 3) is 1.4 kcal 3 mol obtained for WT AP (Table 1). This trend agrees with the 1 as observed reduction in the values of GE determined from the experimental second-order rate constants. Figure 7 shows snapshots of the reactant and transition states of MpNPP in the active site of E322Y AP with averaged values of some key distances. Important changes take place in the active site of AP when this enzyme does not bind the Mg2 ion. The water molecules of the coordination shell of the ion are not found in the active site of the mutant, and Asp51 is no longer bridging between the Mg2 and the Zn(II) centers. As observed in Figure 7, Asp51 now establishes a hydrogen-bond interaction   by 0.4 kcal 3 mol  12058dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2017575|J.Am.Chem.Soc.2011,133,1205012062JournaloftheAmericanChemicalSocietyARTICLEthe mutation of Lys328 on the diesterase activity of E. coli. The residue occupying the equivalent position in diesterase NPP is Glu211. This residue is negatively charged, and instead of re- maining close to the substrate it is oriented outward the active site. The substitution of Lys328 by a negatively charged residue could provoke large perturbations in the protein structure, which are dicult to sample adequately in our simulations. For this reason we decided to substitute Lys328 by an uncharged residue, a tyrosine. Tyrosine, a residue of similar size to histidine, is able to establish hydrogen-bond interactions in the active site and con- tains an aromatic ring that can make favorable contact with the methyl group.65,66 The free energy barrier obtained for the 1) is smaller to that of WT AP K328Y AP mutant (12.0 kcal 3 mol 1) and very similar to that obtained for E322Y (13.5 kcal 3 mol 1). The free energy barrier and averaged values (12.1 kcal 3 mol of the bond to be broken and the bond to be formed are provided in Table 3. The TS structure is presented in Figure 9, and the contribution of the interaction energy of residue Tyr328 with the reacting system to the energy barrier is depicted in Figure 8. When Lys328 is mutated to tyrosine, this residue makes a smaller unfavorable contribution to the energy barrier, resulting in an increased activity of K328Y AP with diesters with respect to the WT AP (see Table 3). Tyr328 maintains a water-mediated in- teraction with Asp153, which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to one of the water molecules of the coordination shell of the Mg2 center. This network of water-mediated interactions gives more room to the placement of the methyl group, especially at the TS, when the phosphate group must be inverted, as reected in the larger distance between the water molecule coordinated to the Mg2  ion and the esteried oxygen atom (O3).  One important dierence found between the reaction me- chanisms determined in K328Y AP and in wt or E322Y APs is the coordination of the covalent enzymemethylphosphate inter- mediate complex. As explained above, this intermediate remains bound to Zn(I) and Zn(II) in the case of WT AP (E 3 P inter- mediate I in Scheme 2) and only to Zn(I) in the case of E322Y mutant (E 3 P intermediate II in Scheme 2). In the K328Y AP mutant, the methylphosphate group leaves the coordination shell of Zn(I) and approaches Ser102 to form the new POnuc bond. The covalent intermediate formed is then coordinated to Zn(II) instead of Zn(I) as shown in Scheme 2 (intermediate III). The obtained covalent intermediate is then more buried into the active site, and this could aect the rate of the subsequent hy- drolysis step, which leads to the regenerated enzyme and the corresponding phosphomonoester. According to these ndings Lys328 could play an important role anchoring the phosphate group in the coordination shell of Zn(I).  As shown above, specicity for monoesterase or diesterase activity could be the consequence of the interactions established through the O3 oxygen atom of the phosphate group. When a monoester is placed in the active site of WT AP, this oxygen atom can establish interactions with a water molecule present in the coordination shell of the Mg2 and with Lys328. Obviously, the next step in our analysis of the diesterase activity of AP is to carry out a double mutation in which these two interactions disappear. The double AP mutant E322Y/K328Y is the natural choice. We obtained the PMF corresponding to the hydrolysis of MpNPP in the active site of this mutant. The free energy barrier is smaller than in any of the single mutants (see Table 3). The TS for the reaction of the phosphodiester hydrolysis in this double mutant is shown in Figure 9 together with some key averaged distances. In this case, Tyr328 establishes a water-mediated interaction with  Figure 8. Averaged contribution of the interaction energy of residue 328 with the reacting system (Ser102  MpNPP) to the energy barrier of hydrolysis of MpNPP catalyzed by WT AP and several mutants.  1 observed from the second- with the increase of 7.9 kcal 3 mol order rate constants. The indirect eect is due to the displacement of Lys328 when a diester is placed in the active site of the mutant. In such a case Lys328 can be alternatively stabilized by Asp51, a residue that is not available in WT AP because that residue is found bridging between Zn(II) and the Mg2 centers (see Figure 1A). As a result, there is more room in the active site to place the alkyl group of the diester and then Lys328 makes a smaller contribution to the energy barrier of diester hydrolysis in E322Y mutant than in WT AP. This is reected in the dierences between the averaged values of the interaction energy of residue 328 with the reacting system at the transition and reactant states obtained for WT AP, E322Y AP, and other mutants represented in Figure 8.  Another interesting change found in the E322Y mutant is the coordination of the covalent intermediate obtained in this re- action step. In the mutant, after crossing the TS region, the reaction proceeds with the nucleophile leaving the coordination shell of Zn(II) and approaching the methylphosphate group that remains bound to Zn(I). Then the enzymemethylphosphate intermediate is found in the coordination shell of Zn(I) as shown in Scheme 2 (E 3 P intermediate II). The deletion of the positive charge associated to the Mg2 ion, absent in the E322Y mutant, obviously favors the displacement of the nucleophile toward the phosphate group, while this remains coordinated to Zn(I). This coordination of the covalent intermediate is dierent to that found in WT AP (intermediate I).  Conclusions obtained from the study of E322Y mutation encouraged us to analyze the consequences of an in silico muta- tion of Lys328. This residue stabilizes both the reactants and TS of mNBP hydrolysis in AP to a similar extent, and the contribu- tion of its interaction energy to the barrier, computed according to eq 3, is small, 1.1 kcal 3 mol 1, while the eect on the barrier 1, as observed in for MpNPP hydrolysis is 26.8 kcal 3 mol Figure 8. Mammalian and yeast APs have a histidine instead of lysine in the equivalent position.60 E. coli AP mutants where Lys328 was substituted by histidine (K328H)6062 or trypto- phan (K328W)62,63 present monoesterase activity. In agreement with our ndings, the study of the K328H AP mutant showed that the Lys328 most probably play an important role in substrate and product binding, but its mutation does not reduce the catalytic properties of E. coli AP.64 We then decided to study the eect of  12059dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja2017575|J.Am.Chem.Soc.2011,133,1205012062JournaloftheAmericanChemicalSocietyARTICLEFigure 9. Representative snapshots of the TS's for the reaction of hydrolysis of MpNPP in the active site of K328Y AP (left) and K328Y/E322Y AP (right). Averaged distances are given in .  Asp51. In the double mutant, this interaction provokes a rotation of the side chain of Tyr328 at the TS, confronting the aromatic ring to the methyl group in such a way that now, the contribu- tion of the interaction energy of this residue with the reacting sys- tem reduces the energy barrier (as seen in Figure 8). After reaching the TS this reaction step is completed when the methylphosphate group leaves the coordination shell of Zn(I) and approaches Ser102 which remains bound to Zn(II) (E 3 P intermediate III in Scheme 2). This result would conrm the proposed role of Lys328 contributing to anchor the phosphate group in the coordination shell of Zn(I).  4. CONCLUSIONS  We have analyzed the hydrolysis reaction of a phosphodiester (MpNPP) in the active site of a phosphomonoesterase (AP) and several mutants to understand the origin of the promiscuity shown by the enzymes that belong to the AP superfamily. Hybrid QM/MM MD simulations provide atomistic details of the reactions that can be used to rationalize the origin of this promiscuity and then to trace the path followed by evolution to specialize dierent enzymes in the catalysis of dierent reactions or dierent substrates.  The rst general conclusion, by comparison with our previous studies, is that alkaline hydrolysis of MpNPP takes place follow- ing dierent mechanisms in aqueous solution and in the active sites of two dierent members of the AP superfamily. Thus, the reaction mechanism is associative in aqueous solution and dis- sociative in two enzymes, a monoesterase (AP) and a diesterase (NPP). The free energy barrier obtained for the reaction in AP lies in between the value obtained in aqueous solution and in NPP, in agreement with the experimental observation that AP is able to catalyze the reaction but not as eciently as the natural phosphodiesterase, NPP. According to our mechanistic ndings, the ability shown by AP to catalyze the hydrolysis of both mono and diesters is not really a promiscuity of reaction, since the nature of the reaction mechanisms remains unaltered in both cases. Our QM/MM studies support a picture of the evolution of the AP superfamily in which the reaction mechanism is main- tained for dierent substrates.  An important feature observed when placing MpNPP in AP active site is the interaction established between the methyl group of the phosphodiester and the nucleophilic oxygen atom,  which contribute to stabilize the reactants with respect to the TS. The analysis based in our QM/MM models also supports the hypothesis of Herschlag and co-workers.22 The interactions established by one of the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group with the coordination shell of the Mg2 ion and with Lys328 could be decisive to dierentiate between monoesters and diesters. Strong hydrogen-bond interactions are found only when the oxygen atom of the phosphate group placed in the surround- ings of these residues does not bear an alkyl group, this is for monoesters. This explanation was tested with dierent AP mu- tants: E322Y, which does not bound Mg2 ions, K328Y, where Lys328 is mutated to an uncharged residue and the double mutant E322Y/K328Y, where both eects are combined. Only the rst mutant has been experimentally studied, nding that the monoesterase activity is dramatically diminished when compared to the WT AP while the diesterase activity is slightly augmented. Our results explain these changes associated to the mutation because deletion of the Mg2 ion does not only eliminate the water molecules of its coordination shell, diminishing the mono- esterase activity, but also provokes a displacement of Lys328, increasing then the diesterase activity. Conversely, mutation of Glu211 and/or Tyr205 in NPP could increase the monoesterase activity of this enzyme.  In addition, the results of our simulations can be also used to explain the ability of this enzyme to catalyze the hydrolysis of dierent substrates having very dierent leaving groups (substrate promiscuity). We show, here and in previous studies with other leaving groups, that the charge on the leaving group at the TS can be stabilized in dierent forms: by means of the Zn(I) ion or by means of other residues placed at the outer side of the active site (such as Lys167) depending on the nature of the leaving group. All in all, these ndings reveal the molecular basis of the evolution in the AP superfamily. These enzymes, evolved from a common ancestor, display preferential activity for diesters or monoesters by means of specic interactions that do not involve the zinc sites, but conserved promiscuous activity because the reaction mechanism, based on the characteristics of the bimetallo active site, is maintained.

Miton1, Gerhard Fischer1, Mark F. Mohamed1, Marko Hyvonen1, Diego P. Morgavi2,3, Dick B. Janssen4 & Florian Hollfelder1  Unculturable bacterial communities provide a rich source of biocatalysts, but their experi- mental discovery by functional metagenomics is difcult, because the odds are stacked against the experimentor. Here we demonstrate functional screening of a million-membered metagenomic library in microuidic picolitre droplet compartments. Using bait substrates, new hydrolases for sulfate monoesters and phosphotriesters were identied, mostly based on promiscuous activities presumed not to be under selection pressure. Spanning three protein superfamilies, these break new ground in sequence space: promiscuity now connects enzymes with only distantly related sequences. Most hits could not have been predicted by sequence analysis, because the desired activities have never been ascribed to similar sequences, showing how this approach complements bioinformatic harvesting of metage- nomic sequencing data. Functional screening of a library of unprecedented size with excellent assay sensitivity has been instrumental in identifying rare genes constituting catalytically versatile hubs in sequence space as potential starting points for the acquisition of new functions.  1 Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, 80 Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1GA, UK. 2 INRA, UMR1213 Herbivores, F-63122 Saint-Gene`s- Champanelle, France. 3 Clermont Universite, VetAgro Sup, UMR Herbivores, BP 10448, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France. 4 Groningen Biomolecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG, Groningen, The Netherlands. w Present address: Synthetic and Systems Biology Unit, Institute of Biochemistry, Biological Research Centre of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged 6726, Hungary. Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to F.H. (email: fh111@cam.ac.uk).    A much broader range of enzyme catalysts than currently known is needed to address a number of challenges from the implementation of green, sustainable processes in white biotechnology1 to a fundamental understanding of the evolutionary origin and mechanistic basis of biocatalysis. Microbial ecosystems are viewed as enormous reservoirs of genetic diversity2, but 99% of environmental microorganisms are understood to be unculturable as yet3. Extensive sequencing efforts using DNA that was directly extracted from environmental samples (eDNA) have already given unprecedented insight into the make-up and genetic diversity of such ecosystems4. However, extrapolation from sequence to protein function is not trivial and often gives only a rough idea of functional assignments5. As a consequence, annotations frequently prove to be incorrect when tested experimentally6. Large-scale experimental characterization would be the preferred basis of functional annotation of proteins, but is currently time-consuming and expensive: which is why sequencing dominates metagenomic explorations. Furthermore, it is especially difcult to predict entirely new enzymes without precedent: genes without signicant homology, encoding catalysts for unfamiliar reactions that have not yet been comprehensively assigned are likely to be overlooked (or remain unannotated). As a consequence, the percentage of genes with unknown functions in newly sequenced genomes has remained constant over the last decade (at B3040%)7.  Functional annotation is further complicated by increasing evidence for catalytic promiscuity (that is, the ability of enzymes to process more than one type of substrate). Promiscuous side activities assist evolutionary adaptation by providing a head start activity after gene duplication, enabling a smoother route from one enzyme function to another by avoiding loss of function during their interconversion8,9. Enzyme promiscuity is even harder (and often impossible) to predict by sequence analysis than primary activities10, thus adding multiple dimensions to the challenge of experimental identication of function. As a consequence, the functional potential of this underground network11 remains largely unexplored. Functional characterizations of protein families suggest however that promiscuity is an intrinsic enzyme property12,13, a potential marker for evolutionary related proteins14 and a rich source of new functions15. Apart from chance observations no comprehensive system for detection of promiscuity exists. Discovery of promiscuous activities will be valuable: by analogy to natural neofunctionalization based on promiscuity, the identication of promiscuous activities similarly provides starting points for enzyme repurposing by directed evolution and can ultimately yield useful catalysts of practical utility.     Experimental screening of eDNA, where the corresponding proteins are heterologously expressed in a surrogate host, is a powerful method to functionally identify and annotate novel enzymes without relying on homology16. However, success depends on the efciency of the heterologous expression17 and hit rates are typically extremely low (estimated at one hit per 104105 variants, depending on the target activity)18. Efcient ultrahigh-throughput systems are therefore essential to cover enough eDNA sequence space to beat the odds19. Apart from costly robotic screening of individual metagenomic library members, requiring expensive liquid handling systems20 and labour-intensive procedures, no direct screening system for catalytic product formation (and able to screen large libraries to yield large numbers of hits) has been used to isolate novel catalysts in functional metagenomics. Apart from providing ultrahigh throughput, an experimental system for identifying promiscuous activities in metagenomes must be sensitive enough to pick up potentially weak side activities, as their rates are often several orders of magnitude slower than native activities15.  To address the challenge of performing sensitive functional screening with ultrahigh throughput, we use water-in-oil droplets, a biomimetic compartment acting as a genotype phenotype linkage21,22, in analogy to cells. Monodisperse droplets are produced in microuidic chips so that quantitative and sensitive measurements can be performed23 and ultrahigh- throughput sorting24 enables selection of droplets according to their uorescence. Using this format, up to B108 biochemical reactions can be performed per day, typically in pico- to femtolitre volumes, resulting in dramatically lower screening costs compared with robotic screening25. Microuidic droplets have been successfully used for directed evolution2527 strain selections28,29 or bioprospecting30. We now employ such droplets as vessels to miniaturize cell lysate assays27the most frequently used screening formats in metagenomics19,31to the single-cell level. In this experimental set-up, each library member is represented by a single cell, statistically compartmentalized into one droplet and assayed for catalytic activity after cell lysis. A microuidic screening platform is used to recover and identify various hydrolases from metagenomic sources by screening for the hydrolysis of two substrates: sulfate monoesters, containing one of the most unreactive functional groups in biology32, and phosphate triesters. The latter are non-natural environmental pollutants historically used as pesticides33 that we now use to probe the catalytic potential of microbial communities for degradation of xenobiotics. The high sensitivity of our platform enabled us to isolate enzymes with strong and weak activities, including promiscuous side activities that have not been selected in the course of evolution and could not be predicted by sequence homology.

(Note: as the photomultiplier tube saturated at around 10 AU, values shown here as B10 AU may be higher). (c) The selection stringency was tested by monitoring the enrichment of a PTE variant PC86 over multiple rounds of microuidic sorting. Three samplesmetagenomic library before selection; DNA recovered from round 1; DNA recovered from round 2were analysed for (i) their total plasmid content and (ii) the number of plasmids encoding PC86 by quantitative PCR. The proportion of PC86 in each DNA sample (library before selection, round 1 and round 2) was calculated by dividing the number of plasmid PC86 by the total number of plasmids.

A metagenomic library of 1,250,000 variants pooled from a variety of sources (combining libraries derived from soil, degraded plant material and cow rumen samples; SCV, Supplementary Table 1) was screened in droplets following the strategy illustrated in Fig. 1. Library members were expressed in Escherichia coli and single cells were compartmentalized (with a Poisson dis- tribution that gives an average of B0.8 cells per droplet) into monodisperse 2 pl droplets (a volume found to allow suitably sensitive screening of metagenomic librariesFig. 2a and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Bacteria were co-compartmenta- lized with lysis agents and the respective uorogenic substrates (sulfate monoester 1d or phosphate triester 2d; Fig. 1) in two different screening experiments. After a two-day off-chip incu- bation, the emulsions were re-injected into the sorting chip, where B20 million droplets (covering the library size more than 15 times and found to be sufcient to recover all hits in a model library; Supplementary Figs 3 and 4) were analysed in B2 h and the brightest 0.01% (sulfatases) or 0.01 and 0.001% (phosphotriesterases (PTEs), in two sorts performed in parallel and later combined) of the droplets selected (Fig. 2b). This relatively tolerant detection threshold was chosen to avoid loss of potential hits. The selected droplets were subsequently de- emulsied and plasmid DNA was recovered. The high-copy plasmid DNA allowed its direct re-transformation into E. coli27. The nal number of transformants exceeded 104 (one droplet gave on average approximately ve transforming clones depending on the plasmid copy number found to vary as a function of the insert size; Supplementary Fig. 6). To enrich the hits further, a second microuidic screening cycle (Fig. 1) was performed with a lower cell/droplet ratio (0.1 cells per droplet), reducing the number of droplets containing multiple cells. Out of B10 million screened, B500 droplets were collected as arylsulfatase hits and B300 as PTEs (corresponding to B0.007% or B0.003% of droplets for sulfatases and PTEs, respectively; Supplementary Figs 7 and 8). The resulting transformants were screened on Petri dishes or in 96-well plates for hydrolysis of sulfate monoester 1c or phosphate triester 2d, respectively. In 10% of the variants hydrolytic turnover was conrmed (Supplementary Fig. 9). Sequencing the plasmids of the conrmed positive hits revealed six and eight unique sequences for sulfatases and PTEs, respectively (Fig. 3). The low positive/ negative ratio observed at the end of the screening campaign can be explained mainly by the deliberately tolerant sorting gate chosen to avoid loss of relevant clones at the cost of collecting false positives: droplets with a two- to vefold higher uorescence than background were selected (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Assessing enrichment over microuidic rounds. Despite the permissive sorting gate applied (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 7), we sought to quantify the enrichment obtained in our screening campaign. To this end, the abundance of one PTE hit in the library (PC86; Fig. 3) was analysed using quantitative PCR before and after the two rounds of sorting. Figure 2c shows that the plasmid content of this hit in the library increased 41,000- fold during the rst round and 4100-fold during the second round of sorting, corresponding to an overall enrichment of 4105 (from 10 -6% to nearly 0.5%; Supplementary Fig. 10). Such enrichment capacity betters previously reported hit rates in functional metagenomic selections (estimated to be between 1/10,000 and 1/100,000)18, demonstrating the utility of the microdroplet format to recover extremely rare hits. An enrichment of more than 1,000-fold in one round of screening (despite a permissive sorting gate) is similar to or exceeds other studies using microuidic droplets24,27,34. Sorting with greater stringency could be applied to achieve a similar enrichment in fewer rounds35. The objective of extending coverage to include hits even with weak activity, however, was made possible by a low detection threshold (o3,000 uorescein molecules being detected; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2) and exemplied the ability to detect low activities (Supplementary Fig. 11).  Characterization of metagenomic hits. (a) Sulfatase hits. Our screening workow yielded six unique variants (Fig. 3) that turned over sulfate ester 1d (Fig. 1). Three hits possessed genes predicted to be part of the sulfatase family (see Fig. 3 for the assignments by Pfam, the protein families database36). One gene (p35) was recloned, the protein P35 was puried and shown to hydrolyse sulfate ester 1a (Supplementary Fig. 12) with high efciency (kcat/KM 1.7 105 s - 1 M - 1; Supplementary Table 3) and high (kcat/KM/kuncat 1.5 1014 M - 1; Supplementary prociency Table 4), demonstrating the ability to recover an enzyme with high specic activities from our metagenomic libraries. Three hits contained genes that were assigned to the Pfam arylsulfotransferase family (p40, b1 and p82). We experimentally veried this assignment after recloning and purication of the protein P40 (Fig. 3). P40 was shown to catalyse sulfate transfer from sulfate ester 1a to phenolate following a ping-pong mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 13) and can therefore be considered as a new adenosine 3-phosphate-5- sulfotransferase37. Reactions in phosphosulfate-independent droplets were followed by the release of the uorescent leaving group of 1d. Transferases able to transfer sulfate groups to acceptors present in the cell lysate were therefore also selected, indicating that multiple types of related reactions can be recovered by the uorogenic miniaturized cell lysate assay.    (b) PTE hits. Applying the screening workow to PTEs (using triester 2d as substrate) led to the isolation of eight unique and novel sequences, mostly originating from unknown microorgan- isms (Supplementary Table 2). Only one of these genes (p83) was predicted as a potential PTE by Pfam domain recognition (Fig. 3). To conrm PTE activity, we identied the genes most likely to encode triesterase enzymes and cloned them into an expression vector. Nine genes in total (p83, p84, p85, p86, p87, p88.1, p88.2, p90 and p91; highlighted in green in Fig. 3) were recloned and their encoded proteins puried. All enzymes were active towards the uorogenic triester 2d (Fig. 1) used for screening, conrming the isolation of genuine PTEs (Table 1). When tested with the pesticides paraoxon 2a or parathion 2b (Supplementary Fig. 12), 5- to 100-fold slower rates than for the uorogenic triester 2d were observed (8 M- 1 s- 1 for P84 to 3 103 M- 1 s- 1 for P83; Table 1). All hits degraded the uorogenic screening substrate and the pesticide, suggesting that triester 2d is a suitable bait for identifying paraoxon hydrolases. Despite rather low second-order rates (83 103 M- 1 s- 1), most of these enzymes substantially accelerated hydrolysis of 2a with rate enhancements up to 1012 (kcat/KM/kw), when compared with the spontaneous hydrolysis in water (Supplementary Table 4).  Access to unexplored sequence space. Sequence-similarity net- works38 (SSNs) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 15) were constructed to map hit sequences: instead of being clustered together they were spread over three superfamilies (dened by the Pfam database36; Fig. 3) and covered a large sequence diversity.  The only predicted triesterase (p83) located within the PTE /PTE- like lactonase cluster of the amidohydrolase superfamily (AH; Fig. 4a) and its higher activity towards lactone 8c (Supplementary Fig. 12 and kcat/KM 5 104 s- 1M- 1; Table 1) were veried experimentally, indicating that P83 is a new lactonase endowed with phosphotriesterase activity.   The remaining hits deed prediction and were scattered over three superfamilies. (i) Two were also AH superfamily members (P88.1 and P88.2) but were located in a completely different region of the SSN (Fig. 4a) and shared very little sequence identity (o15%) with other PTEs from the same superfamily (Supplementary Fig. 16). No other native function was predicted, making them completely unassigned. (ii) All hits assigned to the metallo-b-lactamase (MBL) superfamily (P84, P85, P86, P87 and P90) have close homologues in the NCBI non-redundant database predicted as putative b-lactamases. However, none of the ve hits was able to degrade the chromogenic b-lactam 10 (Supplementary Fig. 12), a frequently used probe of b-lactamase activity14,39. In the SSNs (Fig. 4b), the genes p85, p86 and p87 located in proximity to sequences coding for PTEs and lactonases. However, no lactonase activity was detected in any of these hits (with lactones 8a, 8b, 8c and 8d12; Supplementary Fig. 12), conrming that sequence similarity is not a good predictor for activity. P84 and P90 are positioned away from other known triesterases and seem more related to glyoxalase II (Fig. 4b), a family of thioesterases from the glyoxalase system that catalyses the hydrolysis of S-lactoylglutathione into glutathione and lactate40. Experimental verication (Table 1) of their ability to hydrolyse S-lactoylglutathione 7 (Supplementary Fig. 12) suggested that these enzymes were a subgroup of the glyoxalase II family. (iii) One hit, P91, is a member of the a/b-hydrolase (a/b) superfamily related to dienelactone hydrolases (DLHs; Fig. 3). Members of this superfamily possess a catalytic triad41, whereas most bacterial PTEs described to date use catalytic divalent ions to activate a water nucleophile42. The X-ray structure of the protein was determined at a resolution of 1.7  (Supplementary Fig. 18) and structural alignment with a previously characterized DLH43 (also identied in the SSNs, shown in Supplementary Fig. 15) conrmed an a/b hydrolase fold (Fig. 5a), and highlighted a homologous catalytic triad in the active site of P91 (C118, D167 and H199; Fig. 5b). Site-directed knockdown mutagenesis of C118, D167 and H199 led to enzyme inactivation, consistent with catalysis by the cysteine-based catalytic triad in P91 (Fig. 5c), which was expected to provide nucleophilic and charge relay catalysis. We observed electron density consistent with two orientations of C118. Figure 5b highlights potential protecting residues (E37 and H141) that may play a role in stabilizing an inactive conformation of the nucleophile cysteine, as previously invoked44. The lack of electron density in the vicinity of the active site supported the absence of a metal- binding site, underlining a role for the triad instead of a metal cofactor in catalysis. Functional tests further ruled out P91 as a metallo-enzyme: treatment of P91 with chelating agents did not affect its activity towards triester 2a, whereas a reduction (or complete abolition) of activity was observed in all other PTE hits tested (Supplementary Fig. 17).

Hits are spread over (a) the AH clan (Pfam number: CL0034) and (b) the MBL superfamily (Pfam family PF00753). Bright green nodes represent the sequences of metagenomic hits identied in this work. Annotations retrieved from the Uniprot database were used to putatively characterize sequence clusters (represented by coloured nodes). To conrm these annotations, experimentally characterized proteins (red nodes) were added into each network. Previously described OP-degrading enzymes (PTE, phosphotriesterase) are highlighted in yellow; PLL (PTE-like lactonases) are reported in the AH superfamily. 5,042 and 2,984 sequences dene the AH and the MBL networks, respectively. Edges lengths represent protein sequence similarity. Only edges corresponding to similarity scores below E-values of 1 e- 9 (AH) and 1 e- 14 (MBL) are considered; the worst edges displayed correspond to a median 26.5% (or 27.9%) identity over an alignment length of 210 (or 218) residues for the AH (and MBL) networks, respectively. See also the position of additional hits in the a/b superfamily (Supplementary Fig. 15).   Acetylcholine esterases are the biological targets of organopho- sphate (OP) pesticides, acting as suicide substrates leading to acetylcholine esterase inactivation and belong to the a/b super- family (see SSNs of the superfamily in Supplementary Fig. 15). It has been reported that a/b hydrolases have evolved in insects (for example, Lucilla cuprina) to slowly degrade OPs45, conferring insecticide resistance in the absence of a metal cofactor. However, P91 is the rst metal-free bacterial (or archaeal) triesterase to be described, unrelated to insect carboxylesterases (Supple- mentary Fig. 15). Most of these carboxylesterases have evolved ageing-resistant variants46 and are characterized by low turnover rates combined with tight binding45. In contrast, P91 is a weak paraoxon binder (KM BmM) but with relatively high turnover rates (B1 s- 1), suggesting that P91 does not suffer enzyme ageing, allowing up to four orders of magnitude higher kcat (ref. 45).        Selection of catalysts via a promiscuous function. The comparison of the MichaelisMenten parameters (kcat/KM and KM) of our triesterase hits with those of (i) OP hydrolases isolated from pesticide-contaminated soils and (ii) enzymes with known promiscuous triesterase activity (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 5) suggests that paraoxon 2a (or parathion 2b with lower or similar catalytic rates measured; Supplementary Table 3) and, by extension, the synthetic triester 2d are not the physiological substrates of our hits. This conclusion was also supported by the experimental verication of higher activities in P83, P84, P90 and P91 towards lactone 8c, thioester 7 and ester 6, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3).  This observation provides further evidence for the widespread existence of latent enzymatic activities, enabling biocatalysts to promote unnatural reactions besides their native function. Most PTEs known to date were isolated from OP-degrading bacteria, providing a selective advantage in highly OP contaminated soils47. As OP-based pesticides were only introduced into the environment in the 1940s (ref. 42), these enzymes are examples of rapid evolutionary adaptation. Our screens suggest the availability of additional points for head starts in adaptive evolution, spread over three superfamilies. Previously, only B20 experimentally characterized PTEs were  reported in the literature (Supplementary Table 6). We now have increased this number by a third and doubled the number of enzymes with promiscuous triesterase activity.    Many PTEs seem to have evolved from lactonases and retain some degree of lactonase activity14,48,49. However, most of our hits were not active (Table 1) towards the natural lactones tested (8b, 8c and 8d12), suggesting that they have different evolutionary ancestors than other known PTEs (also supported by their position in the SSNs in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 15) and implying that diverse native activities can accommodate promiscuous triesterase function. As the hits locate mostly in sparsely annotated regions in their respective SSNs (Fig. 4) and because of the relatively short insert sizes, only limited additional information is provided by the genome context (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note 1), the native activities and physiological roles of the hits remain unknown.    t (s)  1,000  3  WT C118A D167N H199A  3  2  1  A400  0 0  2  0 0  1  WT C118A D167N H199A  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  c  vobs (s1)  D167  [Paraoxon 2a] (mM)  E37  H141  C118  H199  a  b  Figure 5 | A triad is the catalytic feature of the a/b-hydrolase fold of the triesterase P91.

Conditions: activity towards paraoxon 2a measured at 25 C (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl pH 8.0).  The majority of the triesterase hits constitute rst examples of enzymes endowed with triesterase activity within their respective superfamily subgroup underlining that a different region of sequence space is accessible by droplet screening compared with metagenome mining by bioinformatics. Accessing such new isolated but functionally characterized points in sequence space makes them hubs for exploration of close homologous sequences that may share similar activities50.  Novel entry points to promiscuous networks. The two bait reactions (that is, phosphotriester hydrolysis and arylsulfate hydrolysis) unearthed six different activities in total: sulfate monoesterase, phosphate monoesterase, phosphate diesterase, PTE, phosphonate monoesterase and (thio)-esterase activities (Fig. 6b). Promiscuity emerged as a feature of all hits, with more than two chemically distinct substrates turned over besides the mostly unknown native ones, conrming the insight that promiscuity is ubiquitous15 and worthwhile harvesting. Many reactions were common among the hits despite their extreme sequence divergence (Supplementary Fig. 16) and their different catalytic machineries (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 17). A comparison of the observed promiscuity suggests trends that reect the respective bait: sulfatase favour charged substrates, triesterases neutral ones. Phosphonate hydrolase and phosphodiesterase activities are common to the two groups (Fig. 6b), but triesterases support these activities only at a low level (Table 1). Testing a range of bait substrates in future experiments may lead to empirical cross-reactivity maps (similar to Fig. 6b) that describe active site recognition features (that is, geometric or electrostatic complementarity, or the availability of reactive active site groups, for example, nucleophiles).      10  1  0.1  KM (mM)  0.01  O  Hits  OPH  Pro  OR 2  R 2  P O  2d  O   R 0 O  Hits  OPH  Pro  O  R1 O  O  6  0  SR 4  7  OH  OO  OO  R5  8a  8b  Substrate charge  O  R1O  O P O  R3  5  R2  O  P O  4  1  Figure 6 | Promiscuity is a general feature of the selected hits. (a) Comparison of the data (catalytic efciencies kcat/KM (left) and KM values (right)) for our hits with known enzymes catalysing phosphotriester hydrolysis suggests that our screening has identied promiscuous activities. OPH summarizes PTE recovered from bacteria isolated from a pesticide-polluted environment and therefore assigned as enzymes that evolved specically for triester hydrolysis.

Indeed, much work in this eld has focused on widely occuring enzymes such as lipases, esterases and carbohydrate-converting enzymes18. To identify potentially less widespread activities, effective screening technologies are key31 to covering larger metagenomic sequence space21 and beating the odds. In this work, we establish droplet screening as a general method to nd new, rare enzymes (6 and 8 hits out of 1,250,000 clones for sulfatase and PTE, respectively) in metagenomes using hydrolytic turnover of two different baits as initial target activities. Previous attempts at harvesting environmental samples by droplet screening have not successfully identied DNA sequences that correspond to the selected phenotype30. By contrast, this present work has yielded functional information on new metagenomic sequences from droplet experiments, for the rst time. More generally, no metagenomic campaign had so far identied triesterases or sulfatases, possibly because they are much less abundant than the above-mentioned enzymes (and certainly with fewer known examples in the literature). Our screening capacity of 45 106 assays per hour enables B108 assays per day so that libraries of 4106 variants are easily accessible at low cost25 without relying on survival-based assays51 or substrate-induced regulators (for example, in SIGEX)52. The high sensitivity of the miniaturized cell lysate assay allowed the isolation of enzymes with catalytic efciencies (kcat/KM) ranging from 54 M- 1 s- 1 (P84) to 9 105 M- 1 s- 1 (P83; Table 1), providing evidence that this microuidic platform is able to identify slow and fast catalysts, with a wide dynamic range extending over four orders of magnitude. Our protocol is straightforward as the readout is directly reporting on enzymatic activity, so that promiscuous activities are accessible. The versatility of microuidic  workows53 makes our platform adaptable for different challenges: to further increase our assay sensitivity (or diminish incubation time) bacterial growth in droplets could be implemented after cell encapsulation, by implementation of an additional microuidic injection (or droplet fusion) step to supply lysis agents and substrates. Furthermore, the microuidic platform is readily applicable to other enzymatic activities, as long as a uorogenic assay can be implemented.        Most (if not all) triesterase hits identied in this work must be presumed not to have evolved in response to an environmental OP triester challenge. Promiscuous activities can be recruited during evolution to give rise to new protein functions8,9,15. Our hits may therefore constitute alternative starting points for adaptive evolution in OP-contaminated environments giving rise to different OP-degrading enzymes than currently known. The systematic detection of such catalytic starting points can form the basis of evolutionary models that account for the adaptive potential of a microbial community to degrade exogenous compounds, such as pesticides and antibiotics. Likewise, directed evolution in the laboratory10 can use hits with low promiscuous activities as starting points that can be enhanced to generate new efcient catalysts.

As demonstrated here, weak or promiscuous activities are directly accessible by droplet screening. This is a powerful method to identify new enzymes for further improvement by protein engineering55 and also new entry points into networks of promiscuous activities56, for which there is currently no systematic prediction tool in bioinformatics. The choice of the bait substrate alone determines which catalytic processes are identied. The ultrahigh throughput and the high sensitivity of our method make microuidic droplets a powerful format to explore this promiscuome (i.e. the collection of promiscuous activities from complex meta- proteomes), where other indirect methods fail. Additional optical detection modes and systematic exploration of libraries with assays for new substrates will be useful to exhaustively harvest many different classes of enzymes. Sensitive, fast and affordable microuidic droplet screening is now validated as an alternative technology for enzyme discovery that can yield information not accessible by other approaches.           Methods Metagenomic material. Environmental libraries from various soils57 and vanilla pods were constructed58 starting with shearing eDNA using a nebulizer and blunting it using Klenow fragment. Next, the resulting 35 kbp fragments were cloned into the EcoRV restriction site in the high-copy plasmid pZero-2 (Invitrogen). DNA from cow rumen was partially digested with the restriction enzyme MluCI. DNA fragments with sizes around 3 kbp were isolated by gel electrophoresis and cloned into the EcoRI site of the same high-copy plasmid pZero-2. The resulting ten libraries (Supplementary Table 1) were pooled together, constituting a library of about 1,250,000 variants, called the SCV library.  Chip design and microuidic device fabrication. The designs for the poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS) chip devices were prepared using Autocad CAD software and designs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. The corresponding CAD les can be downloaded from http://openwetware.org/wiki/DropBase (a database of microuidic device designs). The devices were fabricated with standard soft lithographic procedures59. The photoresist material SU-8 2015 was used to obtain a 15 mm channel height. PDMS monomer and curing agent were mixed at a ratio 10:1 and then poured onto the lithographic plate before degassing. After PDMS solidication (65 C, 4 h), PDMS was activated by exposure to an oxygen plasma and devices were sealed onto a microscope glass slide (or cover slip (thickness: 0.13 mm) for the sorting chip). Hydrophobic modication of the channels surface was achieved by injecting a solution of 1% (v/v) trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-peruorooctyl)silane (Sigma) in HFE-7500 oil into the channels. Electrodes for the sorting devices were prepared using low melting point indium composite solder (51 In/32.5 Bi/16.5 Sn, Indium Corporation).  Preparation of bacterial suspensions for droplet encapsulation. Transforma- tion of B10 ng of the metagenomic library SCV into E. coli (E. cloni 10G Elite, Lucigen) yielded B108 variants on agar plate (containing 40 mg ml- 1 kanamycin) covering the library size B100 times. Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 C, then incubated at 22 C for 2 days. Colonies were subsequently scraped from the agar plates, washed, ltered using a 5-mm lter (Sartorius) and resuspended in MOPS (100 mM, pH 8.0) containing NaCl (115 mM), kanamycin (40 mg ml- 1), complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (one tablet per 50 ml; Roche) and Percoll (25% v/v; Sigma). The cell density was adjusted by dilution to obtain the required cell/droplet ratio after compartmentalization. Assuming a Poisson distribution for bacterial encapsulation60, a cell density OD600 nm B1 should result in B35% of droplets with single cells and B20% of droplets with higher occupancy (for | 15 mm droplets).  Generation of water-in-oil picolitre droplets. Water-in-oil droplets (volume B2 pl, |: 15 mm) were generated using a ow-focusing device (Fig. 1) (dimensions width height of 16 15 mm) bearing three inlets. Two inlets carry aqueous solutions prepared in MOPS buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0), NaCl (115 mM), kanamycin (40 mg ml- 1), EDTA-free protease inhibitor (one tablet per 50 ml; Roche). The streams from these inlets supplied (i) a cell suspension (OD600 nm depending on cell occupancy (i.e. number of cell per droplets) required) in Percoll (25%, v/v, Sigma) and (ii) a mixture of the cell lysis reagents BugBuster (20% v/v, Novagen) and lysozyme (30 kU ml- 1; Novagen), as well as the respective substrate (10 mM of sulfate monoester 1d or phosphate triester 2d). From the third inlet, uorinated oil HFE-7500 (3 M) containing EA surfactant (1%, w/w, RainDance Technologies) was injected. Aqueous solutions and the oil phase were injected using plastic syringes (BD; 1 or 3 ml) at a rate of 50 and 500 ml h- 1, respectively, with PHD 2000 Harvard Apparatus pumps.  Droplet storage and incubation. Droplets were stored in a glass syringe (500 ml, SGE) in HFE-7500 (3 M) with EA surfactant (1%, w/w), covered with mineral oil (Sigma). The uorous phase containing droplets is not miscible with mineral oil and droplets remain at the interface between HFE-7500 and mineral oil. Droplets were incubated from 1 to up to 3 days in the syringe at room temperature (B22 C).  Droplet sorting and electronics. After mounting the incubation syringe vertically on a syringe pump (PHD 2000 Harvard Apparatus), water-in-oil droplets were re-injected into the sorting device at a rate of 30 ml h- 1. The distance between droplets was increased to facilitate the sorting of single droplets by electric pulses. To this end, additional uorous oil (HFE-7500 (3 M) with EA surfactant (0.5%, w/w) was injected at 300 ml h- 1 in the sorting chip. This set-up with a parallel channel design (with a width ratio of 1.3 between waste and positive channels, Supplementary Fig. 4) resulted in a droplet sorting rate of 22.5 kHz, without the need for pressure equilibration between the two outlets as previously required27. A 488-nm laser was focused 180 mm upstream of the sorting junction through a  40 microscope objective (UPlanFLN, Olympus) for uorophore excitation and the emitted uorescent light was collected and amplied using photomultiplier tubes (H8249, Hamamatsu Photonics). The amplied uorescence signal was processed by a data acquisition card operating at 38 kHz (National Instruments, USB-6009) that was linked to a peak detection algorithm, which recorded uorescence distributions (LabView 8.2, National Instrument). Hardware triggering was implemented via a voltage comparator (LM339N, Texas Instruments), which compared the voltage readout by the photomultiplier tube with a user-dened arbitrary voltage generated via the acquisition card and doubled using an operational amplier (LM358N, STMicroelectronics), to generate voltages between 0 and 10 V. A pull-up resistor (1 kO) was used to force the logical high state of the comparator to 5 V and send the trigger signal to the pulse generator. Whenever the uorescence peak reached a user-dened voltage threshold (typically corresponding to two- to vefold increase over the average uorescence of droplets not containing active enzymes), a pulse generator triggered a single square pulse of 500 ms length and an amplitude of 0.60.8 Vp. This pulse was amplied 1,000-fold by a high voltage amplier (610E, Trek) and applied to the electrodes on the sorting device. With the current electronics implementation, 500 ms was found to be the minimal pulse length able to trigger the fast camera used as a control, to monitor the success of sorting. The electric pulse applied between the two electrodes dielectrophoretically attracted the highly uorescent droplet towards the narrower channel (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 5). The sorting events were recorded with a fast camera (Phantom V7.2) that was triggered by the voltage comparator, to allow analysis of whether the desired droplets with increased uorescence were selected. Optical inspection of the movies thus recorded monitored that only single droplets were selected for each pulse.  Detection of useful hits in this format was only possible after improvements to the sensitivity of the previously described miniaturized cell lysate assay27. This was achieved by adapting our microuidic platform to generate and sort 2 pl droplet compartments (| 15 mm). To test whether smaller droplets led to higher sensitivity, we measured the accumulation of uorescein over time in two droplet populations with different volumes (2 and 8 pl) containing single bacteria transformed with a metagenomic variant active towards sulfate monoester 1d (Fig. 1). Fluorescence signal change (average uorescence of droplets containing bacteria divided by average uorescence of empty droplets) increased approximately twice as fast in 2 pl droplets than in 8 pl droplets (Supplementary Fig. 1), conrming that sensitivity was improved by scaling down the droplet size.  DNA recovery. Plasmid DNA from uorescent droplets was recovered by de- emulsication using 1H,1H,2H,2H-peruorooctanol27. The use of a high copy number plasmid (pZero-2; 41,000 copies per cell) in an E. coli endonuclease knockout strain (E. cloni 10G, Lucigen, bearing the mutation endA1) allowed plasmid DNA recovery from droplets even after 2 days of incubation, without additional PCR amplication.  Quantication of enrichment of hits by quantitative PCR. To quantify the total number of plasmids from the library, a set of primers annealing to the vector was used:  50-TTTCTGCGGACTGGCTTT-30 (qPZeroFwd) 50-ACAGGATTAGCAGAGCGAGG-30 (qPZeroRev). To quantify plasmids containing PC86 (as a representative metagenomic hit), 50-ATACCGACGAAGCCCTGT-30 (qPC86Fwd) 50-TCGGCAGGGTCATACACATA-30 (qPC86Rev). All primers were supplied by Invitrogen Life Technologies. Quantitative real-  primers annealing to the inserted PC86 sequence were designed:  time PCR experiments (see also Supplementary Fig. 10) were performed in triplicate using Sensimix SYBR green (Bioline) in the Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences). The PCR conditions were as follows: initial DNA denaturation at 95 C for 10 min, 40 cycles (95 C for 10 s; 52 C for 15 s; 72 C for 20 s) and a temperature gradient enabling determination of the DNA melting temperature (between 72 C and 95 C). Reference curves using both sets of primers were obtained with correlation coefcients R240.99.     Metagenomic screening on plates. Metagenomic libraries (ENR-S, ENR-G, ENR-M and ENR-L; Supplementary Table 1) were transformed into electro- competent E. coli (E. cloni 10G Elite, Lucigen) and B100,000 clones were plated on 10 different | 14 cm Petri dishes with Luria Bertani (LB) Agar (1.5%) containing 40 mg ml- 1 kanamycin. After overnight growth at 37 C, plates were incubated at 22 C for 24 h. Colonies were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Corporation) and lysed by three cycles of 10 min incubation at - 20 C and 37 C before being overlaid with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5% agarose (w/v) containing 135 mM of sulfate monoester 1c (Supplementary Fig. 12). Colonies that turned blue after B15 h of incubation at 25 C were isolated and their plasmid DNA extracted using a miniprep kit (Zymo Research) and sequenced.  Fidelity of droplet sorting. We probed whether our miniaturized cell lysate screen in droplets was able to recover hits from metagenomic libraries. Thus, a subset of the library (B100,000 clones) (Supplementary Table 1) was screened for sulfate hydrolases in two experiments: (i) in microuidic droplets using sulfate monoester 1d (4107 droplets in 100 ml, protocol shown in Fig. 1) and (ii) in a classic colony screening procedure61 (400,000 colonies using 40 Petri dishes) using sulfate monoester 1c as a substrate. When the two screens were compared, all hits found on plates were recovered within 0.5 h by droplet screening (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4), except one that was later isolated when the ENR-G library was screened alone. The ability of our system to detect and sort hits was further addressed by analysing the relationship between hit rate and sample size. When covering the library size with a variety of oversampling ratios (by screening a number of droplets corresponding to 2 , 10 , 20 and 25 the library size) we observed an increasing number of recovered model hits (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that the increase in screening capacity indeed leads to more hits (assuming a library contains them). We found that a 410-fold oversampling of the library is sufcient to recover every hit condently, thereby achieving perfect coverage (Supplementary Fig. 4).  Protein production and purication. Open reading frames coding for sulfatase P35 and the sulfotransferase P40 were recloned into a modied expression vector pRSFDuet (Novagen) using the restriction sites NdeIXhoI (P35) and NcoIXhoI (P40). Recombinant plasmids pRSFDuetP35 and pRSFDuetP40 were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). For protein expression transformants were grown in 750 ml LB broth (containing 40 mg ml- 1 kanamycin) at 37 C until an OD600 nmB0.5 was reached. At this stage, expression was induced with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (1 mM) for 15 h at 25 C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in LB medium (30 ml) and lysed by sonication. Cell lysate was obtained by centrifugation (30,000g, 1 h, 4 C) and diluted in a 1:1 ratio with Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 8.0). All subsequent steps were carried out in this buffer, unless stated otherwise. The desired enzyme was puried from diluted cell lysates using a sequence of three columns as follows: (i) anion exchange (Q-sepharose Fast Flow; GE Healthcare) using NaCl gradients 0-400 mM (P35) or 0-1 M (P40), (ii) afnity chromatography (P-sepharose Fast Flow; GE Healthcare) using (NH4)2SO4 gradients 1-0 M (P35) or 500-0 M (P40), and (iii) gel ltration (Superdex 200) running in a Tris-HCl buffer (20 mM, pH 8.0). Chromatographic steps of the purication were carried out in a AKTA FPLC apparatus (GE Healthcare).  Open reading frames coding for PTEs were recloned into the pASKIBA5plus plasmid (Iba Life) using the BsaI restriction site (P83, P84, P85, P87, P881, P90 and P91) or EcoRINcoI restriction sites (P86 and P882). Recombinant plasmids were transformed by electroporation into E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37 C in LB containing 100 mg ml- 1 ampicillin (750 ml) until OD600 nmB0.5. The expression of the amino-terminal Strep-tagged proteins was induced with anhydrotetracyclin (200 mg l- 1) at 25 C for 15 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Tris-HCl (30 ml of a 100 mM solution, pH 8.0) containing NaCl (150 mM) before cell lysis by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged (30,000g, 1 h, 4 C) and the extract was directly loaded onto Strep-Tactin Superow resin (Iba Life) that was previously equilibrated with Tris-HCl (100 mM, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl). Washing steps were performed using Tris-HCl (100 mM, pH 8.0), NaCl (150 mM) and Strep-tagged proteins were eluted in Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM d-desthiobiotin (d-biotin)). Columns were regenerated using Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0; containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl-azo)benzoic acid). Eluted proteins were concentrated to a nal volume of 2 ml and further puried by gel ltration (Superdex 200, in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0).  Mutant P91 C118 was puried in the same way as wild-type P91, but mutants P91 D167N and H199A were prepared using Strep-Tactin spin columns (Iba Life). Mutant-encoding plasmids were transformed by electroporation into E. coli BL21(DE3). Small volume cultures (15 ml) were grown under the same conditions as described above. Cells were pelleted and lysed using 500 ml of a solution containing 1 Bugbuster (Novagen) and 0.001 Lysonase (Novagen) in MilliQ water (Millipore) before addition of Tris-HCl buffer (1 ml, 100 mM, pH 8.0; containing 150 mM NaCl) and centrifugation to remove cell debris. After equilibration using Tris-HCl buffer, Strep-Tactin columns were loaded with the cleared cell lysates and centrifuged for 30 s at 700 g (at 4 C). After a washing step to remove weakly bound proteins, P91 mutants were eluted in Tris-HCl (150 ml of 100 mM, pH 8.0), containing 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM d-biotin. To remove d-biotin, the elutions were buffer exchanged by successive concentrationdilution cycles using 1 ml Amicon 10 k concentrator columns.  Substrates. Sulfate monoester 1d, phosphotriester 2d, phosphate diester 4 and phosphonate 5 were synthetized from the respective chlorides or chloridates6264. Sulfate monoester 1c was purchased from Fluka. Sulfate monoester 1a, phosphate monoester 3, acetate ester 6, thioester 7, lactones 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d1, 8d2 and acetamide 9 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chromogenic b-lactamase substrate 10 (CENTA) was purchased from Merck Millipore.  Enzyme Assays. All enzymatic assays were conducted at 25 C in a nal volume of 200 ml, in the activity buffer (100 mM MOPS-NaOH pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl) that was used throughout the experiments, unless otherwise stated. Measurements were performed in 96-well plate format and product formation followed in SpectraMax M5 or 190 microplate readers. Hydrolysis of substrates with uorescein leaving groups (1d and 2d) was monitored at the following wavelengths: lexcitation 488 nm and lemission 525 nm. A calibration curve (linearly t to the equation: uorescence  1.2 1010 M- 1 [uorescein]) was used to quantify uorescein release. Hydrolysis of esters 1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5, 6 and acetamide 9 was monitored by measuring absorbance of p-nitrophenolate at 400 nm (eE17,700 M- 1 cm- 1). Hydrolysis of thioester 7 was measured in the presence of the indicator 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (500 mM); the increase of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate was monitored at 412 nm (eE13,100 M - 1 cm- 1)39. Hydrolysis of lactones 8b, 8c, 8d1, 8d2 was measured using a pH-shift assay in 2.5 mM Bicine, 200 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM cresol purple pH 8.3 (ref. 65). The pH drop was monitored by the decrease in the absorbance of the indicator dye cresol purple at 577 nm (eE4,000 M- 1 cm- 1). Hydrolysis of lactone 8a was measured at 270 nm in an ultraviolet-transparent 96-well plate. Hydrolysis of b-lactam 10 was measured at 405 nm in phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0). All kinetic parameters were calculated by tting initial rates vo to the MichaelisMenten equations (or, if saturation could not be reached due to solubility limits, to linear correlations) using Kaleidagraph. Example data and details of equations used for tting are shown in Supplementary Fig. 14.  Sequence similarity networks. All protein sequences from superfamilies (AH: Pfam CL0034; MBLs: Pfam PF00753; a/b: Pfam PF07859, PF00135 and PF01738) were retrieved from the EMBL-EBI Pfam database36. To limit the number of sequences and to reduce eventual bias that could induce too many homologous sequences in a network, a cutoff on the sequence identity was applied using CD-HIT66 (40% for AH and MBL, and 30% for a/b). Our metagenomic hits protein sequences and several known characterized members of each protein families were subsequently added to the protein lists to help network functional annotations. The data sets were composed of 5,042 (AH), 2,984 (MBL) and 1,345 (a/b) sequences. Each data set was subjected to an all-versus-all BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information, version 2.2.29 ), considering sequence similarity only when alignment score was below an appropriate threshold (E-values: 1  e- 9 (AH), 1  e- 14 (MBL) and 1 e- 19 (a/b)). The sequence similarity scores (E-values) were then imported into Cytoscape (version 3.0.2) and networks were constructed using the organic layout (in which the lengths of the edges correlate with the dissimilarity of the connected sequences (represented by nodes)). Functional annotations were then imported from the Uniprot database and mapped onto the networks. Recently, the process of generating SSNs from any Pfam families has been made much more convenient by the Enzyme Function Initiative: (http://e.igb.illinois.edu/e-est/)67.  Metal removal. P83, P85, P86, P87, P88.1, P88.2, P90 and P91 were incubated at 4 C in MOPS (100 mM, pH 8) containing NaCl (150 mM) and the chelators EDTA, (25 mM), pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (25 mM) and phenanthroline (2 mM). After 4 days of incubation, chelating agents were removed by successive centrifugations using centrifugation lter tubes (Amicon Ultra-2 ml, 10 kDa; Millipore) and washed with MOPS buffer (as above). To restore divalent metals, the samples were incubated at 25 C with MnCl2 (200 mM) and activity towards phosphate triester 2a (800 mM) was measured by monitoring the increase of 4-nitrophenolate absorbance at 400 nm. Samples that were subjected to the metal removal procedure, without restoring the metal, were used as controls to assay any residual activity in the apo-enzyme.  Crystallization and structure determination. Crystallization conditions were screened in 96-well plates using the sitting-drop vapour diffusion method at 292 K. Crystals of P91 appeared after 36 h in a condition of 0.2 ml P91 (10 mg ml- 1) and 0.2 ml reservoir solution (0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 0.2 M MgCl2 and 20% (w/v) PEG 8,000). Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K at the Swiss Light Source (beamline X06DA) at 0.9188 . Data were processed using autoPROC/XDS/AIMLESS software68. As the crystal suffered signicant radiation damage, affected images were removed from processing, leading to a slightly reduced completeness of 87%the observed electron density however is of good quality and continuous. Phases were obtained through molecular replacement using BALBES/Phaser69, which used a putative DLH from Klebsiella pneumoniae (PDB ID 3F67) as the search model. Two molecules of P91 were found in the asymmetric unit. Iterative structure renement was performed using Refmac5 (ref. 70) from the CCP4 suite71 and Coot72. 97.7% of residues are found within the Ramachandran-favoured, 2.3% in the allowed and none in the disallowed regions. Loop 7480 (in both monomers) shows higher exibility than the rest of the protein and multiple conformations that could not be modelled accurately. Full data collection and renement statistics are shown in Supplementary Table 8. The structure has been deposited with PDB code 4ZI5.  Site-directed mutagenesis. P91 nucleophile mutant C118A was constructed by overlap extension PCR and cloned into the pASKIBA5plus (Iba Life) using the BsaI restriction site. P91 mutants D167N and H199A were constructed using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) with pASKIBA5plus-P91 as DNA template.  References 1. Bornscheuer, U. T. et al.

Tantillo, It   ABSTRACT: The rapidly growing appreciation of enzymes catalytic and substrate promiscuity may lead to their expanded use in the elds of chemical synthesis and industrial biotechnology. Here, we explore the substrate promiscuity of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductases (commonly known as FabI) and how that promiscuity is a function of inherent reactivity and the geometric demands of the enzymes active site. We demonstrate that these enzymes catalyze the reduction of a wide range of substrates, particularly ,-unsaturated aldehydes. In addition, we demonstrate that a combination of quantum mechanical hydride anity calculations and molecular docking can be used to rapidly categorize compounds that FabI can use as substrates. The results here provide new insight into the determinants of catalysis for FabI and set the stage for the development of a new assay for drug discovery, organic synthesis, and novel biocatalysts.  Enzymes are promiscuous, catalyzing reactions beyond what they were specically evolved for with widely varying rates.1 The type of promiscuity observed is often categorized as either conditional, substrate, or catalytic. Conditional promis- cuity occurs when catalysis is induced by altered reaction conditions (i.e., dierent pH or temperature). Substrate promiscuity is dened as the ability of an enzyme to catalyze the same chemical reaction for dierent substrates. Catalytic promiscuity is dened as the ability of an enzyme to catalyze chemically distinct reactions involving dierent types of transition states.2 For example, tyrosine phosphatase has been shown to exhibit both catalytic and substrate promiscuity. Its ability to catalyze both phosphate and sugar hydrolysis reactions highlights the enzymes catalytic promiscuity while its ability to utilize both mono and diester substrates demonstrates its substrate promiscuity.3 In a biological context, some noncanonical promiscuous reactions have been postu- lated to be a critical factor in the evolution of new enzyme function.4 The elds of biotechnology and synthetic chemistry harness enzyme promiscuity to create and use enzymes with target substrates not found in nature.2,5 In particular, the Old Yellow Enzyme family and other ene-reductases are used in industry for the reduction of numerous activated alkenes.6  In this study, we explore the substrate promiscuity of the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase family and we examine how the promiscuity is a function of both inherent reactivity of the substrate and geometric requirements of the enzyme. The canonical physiological function of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (commonly referred to as FabI) is to reduce an enoyl acyl carrier protein (e.g., crotonyl-ACP) to its saturated form (Figure 1A).7 This reaction is the rate limiting step in the type II fatty acid synthesis pathway. It is also well established that FabI exhibits substrate promiscuity on crotonyl Coenzyme A (CoA).8 For both substrates, the proposed mechanism for the enzyme proceeds through a hydride transfer to the -carbon, forming an enolate ion, which then accepts a proton from a tyrosine residue. A ketoenol tautomerization forms the nal product (Figure 1B).9  Here, we explored substrate promiscuity of FabI through a systematic investigation of ve FabI orthologs against 13 substrates. The substrates vary in both geometry and in oxidation state. We evaluated if phylogenetic distance inuenced enzyme behavior and therefore selected a set of ve enzymes from two distinct parts of the phylogenetic tree whose sequence identities ranged from 19.2 to 73.5% (Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figure S1). We demonstrate promiscuous substrate activity on a wide range of substrates and demonstrate that this promiscuity is common across the ve FabIs tested.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Using the well-studied FabI from P. falciparum (pfFabI),13,15 we conducted a sequence homology search using HMMER310 of the UniProt Representative Proteomes (rp75) for FabI homologues, which after ltering for redundancy and false positives through a CDHit,11 resulted in a total of 2191 unique sequences being identied (Figure 2). We selected a subset of ve FabI enzymes that covered four distinct kingdoms across the tree of life. In addition, we selected enzymes with sequence identities that range from 19 to 73.5% with an average value of 36.6% identity (Figure S1). Of the ve enzymes selected, three had been previously characterizedfrom E. coli (ecFabI_<- P0AEK4>), from H. influenzae (hiFabI_<P44432>), and from P. falciparum (pfFabI_<Q9BJJ9>). These three had previously been conrmed to have canonical FabI activity and express as soluble, active proteins in E. coli.7,12,13 In addition, crystal structures have been reported for ecFabI14 and pfFabI.15 The other two enzymes selected were previously uncharacterized enzymes from a diatom, P. tricornutum (ptFabI_<B7FS72>), and from a green alga, A. protothecoides (apFa-bI_<A0A087SQF9>).  Figure 3. Heatmaps depicting the substrate promiscuity measured by observed apparent catalytic eciency (kcat/KM in M1 s1) on a logarithmic scale as determined by steady-state kinetics. Substrates in (A) dier by oxidation state, while those in (B) are ,-unsaturated aldehydes which vary in chain length, branching position, and the addition of a phenyl ring. All calculated errors were below 15%. Substrate versus velocity curves and a full table of kinetic constants with standard errors can be found in Supporting Information Figure S2 and Table S3, respectively. The limit of detection for the assay conducted here is dened as 100 M1 s1 based on the observed rates being at least 2-fold higher than the background NADH oxidation rate at the highest substrate concentration. No observed activity is denoted as N.D (No Detection).   To explore the substrate promiscuity of FabI, we assessed the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADH mediated reduction of a range of structurally related substrates with varying degrees of oxidation states. The substrates selected were trans-crotonyl-coenzyme A (1; ,-unsaturated thioester), ethyl trans-2-butenoate (2; ,-unsaturated ester), trans-2- butenoic acid (3; ,-unsaturated acid), 3-pentene-2-one (4), cyclopentenone (5; both ,-unsaturated ketones), pentanal (6; saturated aldehyde), trans-2-pentenal (7; ,-unsaturated aldehyde), and 2-buten-1-ol (8; ,-unsaturated alcohol), all of which are pictured in Figures 3A. These panels of substrates were selected (A) for their similarity to the native substrate in that they contain ,-unsaturated carbonyls (i.e., ,-unsatu- rated esters, acids, ketones and aldehydes) or (B) to test the potential for catalytic promiscuity (i.e., the potential reduction of the carbonyl in a saturated aldehyde or the reduction of an olen without being conjugated to a carbonyl). No detectible activity was observed in our assay with the majority of these substrates. However, all ve FabI orthologs were found to reduce trans-2-pentenal as well as 3-pentene-2-one (Figure 3, Supporting Information Figures S2 and S3). Formation of the saturated aldehyde product was further validated using gas chromatographymass spectrometry (Supporting Information Figure S4). The catalytic eciencies for each of the ve FabI orthologs on trans-2-pentenal were 34 orders of magnitude lower than that of the native crotonyl-CoA substrate. While dierences of 2 orders of magnitude in eciency exist between the ve FabI orthologs when utilizing the substrate crotonyl-CoA, less than an order of magnitude dierence separates them when utilizing trans-2-pentenal as a substrate. Similarly, the variance in catalytic eciency when utilizing 3-pentene-2-one is within 1 order of magnitude. The eciency of the ve FabI orthologs on 3-pentene-2-one is over 1 order of magnitude higher than on trans-2-pentenal, except for ptFabI, where there is very little dierence in eciency between the aldehyde and ketone.  Upon discovering that the entire family of FabI enzymes tested has substrate promiscuity for ,-unsaturated aldehydes, we expanded our pool of ,-unsaturated aldehyde substrates. The FabI enzymes were assessed for activity against a range of aldehydes that varied in both degree of branching, chain length, and conjugation (compounds 913 in Figure 3B). The production of the corresponding saturated aldehyde as a product was veried again using gas chromatographymass spectrometry for trans-2-pentenal, trans-2-heptenal, and trans-2- nonenal (Supporting Information Figure S4).    trans-2-Pentenal (7), trans-2-heptenal (9), and trans-2- nonenal (10) exhibit roughly the same levels of catalytic eciency across the ve enzymes. Substrate branching leads to severely compromised activity; catalytic eciency for (2E)-2- ethyl-2-butenal (11) decreased by roughly an order of magnitude for pfFabI and ptFabI relative to that for trans-2- pentenal. If a reaction was occurring for the branched substrate in apFabI, ecFabI, and hiFabI, it fell below our limit of detection. In addition, two degrees of unsaturation in the hydrocarbon chain (e.g., trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal (12)) led to decreased activity for all ve enzymes by 12 orders of magnitude relative to that for trans-2-pentenal, with activity for ecFabI being below our limit of detection. Finally, the introduction of a phenyl ring (e.g., cinnamaldehyde (13)) led to a complete loss of activity among all enzymes tested.   Given the reactivity observed for dierent substrates, we hypothesized that both substrate shape and inherent reactivity are critical for catalysis. An ongoing question in our lab is to what degree does an enzyme take advantage of a substrates inherent reactivity, i.e., some substrates will have a higher tendency to be reduced than others, and does the enzyme take advantage of this preference? To evaluate the plausibility of these hypotheses, we conducted both quantum mechanical (QM) calculations on the hydride-accepting ability of substrates in the absence of any protein, as a measure of the substrates inherent reactivity, and molecular docking studies to examine substrate-enzyme shape complementarity. Both potential conformers, s-cis or s-trans, were evaluated, as which of these is the catalytically relevant conformation of the substrate is currently unknown (Figure 4, header). The hydride anity for each substrate was calculated with Gaussian 0918 at the SMD(water)19-B3LYP2024/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory (Figure 4, relative hydride anity). Hydride anities for both conformers were similar, with a slight favoring of the s-cis conformation. Overall, our results imply that if a substrates hydride anity is 1 kcal/mol or lower, then it is predicted to be an active substrate. However, the notable exception to this rule of thumb is cinnamaldehyde, which, despite having a negative relative hydride anity score, had no detectable activity in our assay.  Besides the inherent reactivity toward hydride addition, whether or not a substrate ts appropriately into an active site is also undoubtedly important. For example, in FabI, there is a tyrosine side chain positioned to donate a proton to the enolate formed upon hydride addition (Figure 1B). Substrates that cannot position their carbonyl to interact favorably with this oxy-anion hole are less likely to undergo catalysis.9 To determine the feasibility of binding in a productive orientation, each substrate (in both s-cis and s-trans conformations) was docked into FabI (PDB accession code 1NNU) using the Rosetta Modeling Suite2528 (Figure 4, hydrogen bond score) with a single constraint from the -carbon of the substrate to the carbon of the cofactor from which the hydride is donated (see Supporting Information Figure S5).   From the docking calculation, neither the constraint nor the ligand interface energy (docking score) discriminated between active and inactive substrates for FabI (see Supporting Information Figures S5 and S6), but the ability to hydrogen bond to the catalytic tyrosine (TYR277 in 1NNU) appeared to have predictive value. The hydrogen bond scores for the s-cis conformers indicate that a variety of substrates can t into the pocket in catalytically relevant orientations, including many substrates that did not have activity in the assay. Cinnamalde- hyde, which was expected to have FabI function based on its hydride anity, had a hydrogen bond energy of zero in the docking calculations due to the presence of a bulky phenyl group, which distorts the pocket and forces the catalytic tyrosine away from its position in the crystal structure (see Supporting Information Figure S7). None of the s-trans substrates were able to nd a pose in which they could hydrogen bond to Y277. This result implies that the catalytically relevant conformation is likely the s-cis conforma- tion.    Graphing the log of activity versus the relative inherent reactivity (Figure 5A) or versus the hydrogen bond score (Figure 5B) does not lead to a correlation that could be used to correctly predict the activity of all the substrates examined on their own. Attempts to nd a formula combining both inherent reactivity and hydrogen bond score led to a qualitatively predictive but arbitrary model (see Supporting Information Figure S17). Consequently, we suggest the use of the decision tree shown in Figure 5C to predict potential alternate substrates for FabI. On the basis of the tree, we predict that (E)-1-nitroprop-1-ene would be active while (E)-but-2- enenitrile would not be (see Supporting Information Figure S18); while both have appropriate inherent reactivity, the latters geometry prevents productive binding. We look forward to the testing of this prediction.  The substrate promiscuity described here has implications for facilitating drug discovery eorts, as FabI is a drug target for tuberculosis,30 microbial infections,31 and malaria.13,32 Current drug discovery approaches for FabI rely on the use of the expensive substrate crotonyl-CoA. The discovery of FabI activity with a less expensive substrate (e.g., trans-2-pentenal) has the potential to enable the development of more cost- eective high throughput assays. To illustrate this potential utility, we have demonstrated that inhibition of pfFabI by triclosan, a well-established FabI inhibitor, using trans-2- pentenal as a substrate, can be detected and quantied through the use of ,-unsaturated aldehydes as substrates (Supporting Information Figure S11).  In this study, we have demonstrated that FabI has substrate promiscuity toward ,-unsaturated aldehydes and has a high degree of substrate promiscuity for this reaction. In addition, we conrmed that FabI reduces linear ,-unsaturated ketones.29 We also demonstrated that a combination of molecular docking and quantum mechanics calculations on inherent reactivity can be used to predict substrate promiscuity of FabI. Finally, we demonstrate that this promiscuity for ,- unsaturated aldehydes disclosed here has the potential to decrease costs associated with drug discovery eorts that target FabI. Beyond drug discovery, enzyme promiscuity is a critical property often exploited for chemical synthesis33 and enzyme engineering.3436 Studies such as this provide a critical starting point for chemists looking for a desired function beyond an enzymes named reaction and will broaden the utility of FabI in the chemical sciences.   METHODS  Sequence Mining and Phylogenetic Analysis. Sequences were obtained using the amino acid sequence of pfFabI as a reference to nd homologous sequences in the Representative Proteome 75 (rp75) database, yielding 6028 sequences. Redundant sequences were removed using a 90% sequence identity cuto with the CD-HIT suite.11 Sequences not in the interval of 250350 residues were removed, and sequences not having the characteristic tyrosine-X6- lysine catalytic motif were removed,37 which resulted in 2191 sequences. The sequences were then aligned using a MUSCLE alignment in Geneious. Taxonomic information for each sequence was obtained using the UniprotKB. A phylogenetic tree was then constructed in Geneious using the UPGMA algorithm and a Jukes- Cantor genetic distance model. The tree image was then created using the GraPhlAn software tool.16,17  Substrate and Enzyme Selection. A protein and chemical space of 100 substrates and 2191 enzymes was considered, equating to roughly 105 possible enzymesubstrate combinations. To narrow this down to a tractable experimental space, we identied 65 unique combinations to provide a broad understanding of general specicity trends in the FabI family.  Substrates were selected for screening in the assay based on two key parameters: (1) geometry and (2) oxidation state. We were interested in the eects of dierent changes of the geometry, so substrates were chosen that had increased branching (11), increased conjugation (12), larger steric demand and increased conjugations (13), and increasing chain length (7, 9, and 10). It is known that FabI has activity on crotonyl-CoA, for which the oxidation state of the carbon in the thoiester is +3. We selected a variety of other carbon centers that also had formal +3 oxidation states, such as an ester (2) and a carboxylic acid (3). The activity of this family of enzymes on ,-unsaturated ketones has also been established,18 for which the formal oxidation states of the carbonyl are +2. The use of an ,-unsaturated ketone (4) served as a good benchmark for promiscuous activity, and the cyclic ketone (5) allowed for the probing of the active conformation. We also tested a variety of ,-unsaturated aldehydes, which also have a formal oxidation state of +2 (see Supporting Information Figure S1 for additional information).  Enzymes were selected following three criteria: (1) Representation across multiple kingdoms from the tree of life, (2) a broad range of identity based on primary sequence, and (3) at least one for which there is a crystal structure with bound ligand. The rst two metrics ensure that any observed functional trend observed is not unique within either a kingdom or to a specic FabI subfamily. The third metric ensured that there was a good starting point for molecular modeling in order to better understand the enzyme sequence- structurefunction relationship.  Gene Synthesis and Plasmid Construction. Synthetic genes coding for FabI enzymes were codon optimized for E. coli expression and synthesized as linear dsDNA by IDT or Life Technologies. DNA and amino acid sequences can be found in Supporting Information Figures S12 and S13, respectively. The pET29b+ plasmid, containing a Kanamycin resistance gene and a C-terminal His-tag, was linearized with restriction enzymes EcoRI and NdeI sequentially and amplied using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using the primers, FWD 5-AATTCGAGCTCCGTCGACAAGCTTG-3 and RVS 5- ATGTATATCTCCTTCTTAAAGTTAA-3. Genes were amplied by PCR using FWD 5-TTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACAT-3 and RVS 5-CAAGCTTGTCGACGGAGCTCGAATT-3. The genes were assembled using Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) as described by Quan and Tian38 and transformed into electro- competent BLR(DE3) E. coli cells using a Micropulser Electroporator. Individual colonies were picked, grown overnight in Terric Broth containing 50 g/mL Kanamycin at 37 C, and split for either mini- prepping and sequence verication via Sanger sequencing or for generation of glycerol stocks by mixing 1 mL of culture with 1 mL of 50% sterile glycerol. Glycerol stocks were frozen at 80 C.  Expression and Purication. The cell pellet from a 25 mL overnight culture in Terric Broth containing 50 g/mL of Kanamycin at 37 C was resuspended in 25 mL of autoinduction media (1 mM MgSO4, 1% trace metals, 5% NPS (0.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 1 M KH2PO4, 1 M Na2HPO4), 0.2% alpha-lactose, 0.05% glucose, 0.5% glycerol, 50 g/mL Kanamycin in TB) and grown at 18 C for 24 h for protein expression. Cells were centrifuged at 4700 rpm for 20 min, and supernatant was removed. Cells were either used immediately for protein purication or frozen at 20 C. Cells were resuspended in 500 L of wash buer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 MM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) and then combined with a lysis mix to achieve a nal concentration of Bugbuster protein extraction reagent (Millipore) at 1, 67 g/mL PMSF, 0.53 mg mL1 lysozyme, and 67 g/mL DNase. Cells were placed on a rocker for 20 min at RT and then centrifuged at 14 700 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was added to a gravity column containing 100 L of HisPur cobalt resin (ThermoFisher), washed with six column volumes of wash buer, and eluted with 250 L of elution/protein buer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Supporting Information Figure S9), and concentrations were assessed via absorbance at 280 nm and the 260/280 ratio using an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek). Extinction coecients of proteins were calculated using the ExPASy ProtParam tool.39    Kinetic Assays. All kinetic assays were performed in 100 L mixtures containing 500 M NADH in 96 well plates. The KM for NADH with no inhibitors was previously observed to be 20.5 M for the FabI from Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus.41 In addition, a Brenda search of FabI (EC 1.3.1.9) shows that for wild type FabI, the reported KM for NADH ranges from 385 M. Therefore, we selected to conduct all assays in the presence of NADH, which we hypothesize will saturate the enzyme. Dierent substrate and enzyme concen- trations were utilized for each enzymesubstrate combination. For trans-2-pentenal, trans-2-heptenal, 2-ethyl-2-butenal, trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal, ethyl trans-2-butenoate, cinnamaldeyde, 3-pentene-2- one, 2-cyclopentene-1-one, trans-2-butenoic acid, pentanal, and 2- butene-1-ol, 10 mM of each substrate was serially diluted 2-fold seven times. For trans-2-nonenal, 1 mM was serially diluted 2-fold seven times. For 3-pentene-2-one and 2-buten-1-ol, a stereochemically pure all trans substrate was not commercially available. Those substrates were assayed as a mixture of cis and trans isomers. For all assays, a negative control with no substrate was used. Between 2 and 12 M enzyme was used for trans-2-pentenal; 14 M for trans-2-heptenal and trans-2-nonenal; 933 M for (2E)-2-ethyl-2-butenal; 1875 M for trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal; 1171 M for ethyl trans-2-butenoate; 1047 M for both cinnamalydehyde and cyclopentene-1-one; 3.2 20 M for 3-pentene-2-one; and 2235 M for trans-2-butenoic, pentanal, and butene-1-ol. It should be noted that enzyme concentration was normalized in the calculation of the apparent kinetic constants.     Crotonyl-CoA required much more variable conditions for each enzyme. Data using 0.4 M of ecFabI vs 2 mM crotonyl-CoA serially diluted 2-fold was combined with data using 43 nM ecFabI vs 2 mM crotonyl-CoA. Similarly, data using 0.4 M hiFabI vs 2 mM crotonyl- CoA serially diluted 2-fold was combined with data using 39 nM hiFabI vs 2 mM serially diluted crotonyl-CoA. Then, 9 nM pfFabI was used vs 200 M crotonyl-CoA serially diluted 2-fold. Next, 25 nM apFabI was used vs 2 mM crotonyl-CoA serially diluted 2-fold. Finally, 11 nM of ptFabI was used vs 125 M crotonyl-CoA serially diluted 2- fold.  Due to the various hydrophobicities of the substrates, dierent conditions were employed to bring substrates into solution. For ethyl trans-2-butenoate, butenoic acid, 3-pentene-2-one, 2-cyclopentene-1- one, pentanal, 2-butene-1-ol, and cinnamaldehyde, 1.25% DMSO and 1.25% Triton X-100 nal concentrations were used to bring these substrates into solution. For 2,4-heptadienal, 2.5% DMSO nal concentration was used. A 1.25% DMSO nal concentration was used for (2E)-2-ethyl-2-butenal. For trans-2-pentenal, trans-2-heptenal, and trans-2-nonenal, a 1.25% DMSO nal concentration and a 0.025% Triton X-100 nal concentration were used. No extra reagents were needed to bring Crotonyl-CoA into solution.  To test for the eects of solvents on catalytic eciency, kcat/KM was the following measured for ptFabI on trans-2-pentenal under conditions: (1) 1.25% DMSO and 1.25% Triton X-100 nal concentrations, (2) 1.25% DMSO, (3) 1.25% Triton X-100, (4) and no DMSO or Triton X-100. Catalytic eciencies were all within 2 orders of magnitude of each other. Substrate versus velocity curves are presented in Supporting Information Figure S10.  Enzyme activity was monitored by the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm over the course of an hour using an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer. Due to the one-to-one stoichiometric ratio between NADH and the various substrates, the oxidation of 1 mol of NADH corresponds to the reduction of 1 mol of one of the substrates. Rates were measured in OD/min and converted to M/min using an NADH standard curve. From Supporting Information Figure 2, most plots were linear on non-crotonyl-CoA substrates, and therefore apparent kcat/KM was determined by taking the slope of the tted line. However, ptFabI on trans-2-pentenal and trans-2-heptenal has MichaelisMenten kinetics. The linear portions of the curves were used for apparent kcat/KM. On crotonyl-CoA, under our conditions, ecFabI, hiFabI, and pfFabI have linear rate vs substrate plots. ApFabI shows MichaelisMenten kinetics, so the linear portion of this curve was used for apparent kcat/KM. PtFabI is observed to have substrate inhibition on crotonyl-CoA. The linear portion of the curve was used to calculate the apparent kcat/KM for ptFabI. Gas ChromatographyMass Spectrometry. The saturated aldehyde products for the substrates trans-2-pentenal, trans-2-heptenal, and trans-2-nonenal were validated using gas chromatographymass spectrometry and compared to internal reference spectra for trans-2- pentenal and trans-2-nonenal, and trans-2-heptenal was compared to the NIST spectrum.40 Gas chromatographymass spectrometry parameters along with the spectra can be found in Supporting Information Figure S4.  Triclosan Inhibition Assay. Stock solutions of 1 mM, 5 M, and 100 nM triclosan were prepared by dissolving triclosan into pure DMSO and then diluting 100 fold to yield 10 M, 50 nM, and 1 nM triclosan in protein buer (1% nal DMSO). The kinetic assay described above was run with pfFabI and trans-2-pentenal, but with 10 M, 50 nM, or 1 nM triclosan spiked in. In addition, secondary euent from Woodland, CA wastewater was collected, sterile ltered, and buered to pH 7.5, see Supporting Information Figure S11.  Quantum Mechanics Calculations. QM calculations were performed with Gaussian 09.18 Minima were located using B3LYP2024/6-31+G(d,p) with the SMD continuum solvation19 method using water. Stationary points were conrmed as minima using harmonic vibrational analysis (no imaginary frequencies for minima). Structures used for calculations are provided in the Supporting Information, and computed energies are shown in Figure S8.  Docking Calculations. A single crystal structure of FabI (PDB ID: 1NNU) was minimized using a constrained FastRelax procedure from the Rosetta modeling suite.2528 The dierent substrates were then docked using the constraint described above (see Supporting Information Figures S5 and S6 for additional details on constraints). A total of 500 docking runs per substrate were performed to ensure that sampling was sucient. The resulting structures were then ltered by (1) their ability to meet the constraints, structures that did not satisfy the constraints were not considered; (2) total protein energy, the lowest ve structures in total protein energy were considered; and (3) the structure with the most negative hbond_sc score was selected from those ve. An example docking simulation is provided in the Supporting Information.

Ark,    Javaria Najeeb,   S Supporting Information  ABSTRACT: The LpxC enzyme in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway is one of the most promising and clinically unexploited antibiotic targets for treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. Progress in medicinal chemistry has led to the discovery of potent LpxC inhibitors with a variety of chemical scaolds and distinct antibiotic proles. The vast majority of these compounds, including the nanomolar inhibitors L-161,240 and BB-78485, are highly eective in suppressing the activity of Escherichia coli LpxC (EcLpxC) but not divergent orthologs such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa LpxC (PaLpxC) in vitro. The molecular basis for such promiscuous inhibition of EcLpxC has remained poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of EcLpxC bound to L-161,240, providing the rst molecular insight into L-161,240 inhibition. Additionally, structural analysis of the EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex together with the EcLpxC/BB-78485 complex reveals an unexpected backbone ipping of the Insert I ab loop in EcLpxC in comparison with previously reported crystal structures of EcLpxC complexes with L-threonyl-hydroxamate-based broad-spectrum inhibitors. Such a conformational switch, which has only been observed in EcLpxC but not in divergent orthologs such as PaLpxC, results in expansion of the active site of EcLpxC, enabling it to accommodate LpxC inhibitors with a variety of head groups, including compounds containing single (R- or S-enantiomers) or double substitutions at the neighboring C atom of the hydroxamate warhead group. These results highlight the importance of understanding inherent conformational plasticity of target proteins in lead optimization.   INTRODUCTION  LpxC is an essential zinc-dependent enzyme in Gram-negative bacteria that catalyzes the deacetylation of UDP-3-O-(acyl)-N- acetylglucosamine in the biosynthesis of lipid A, the membrane anchor of lipopolysaccharide.1 As the major lipid component of the outer monoleaet of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane, lipid A protects bacterial cells from the damage of external agents, such as detergents and antibiotics. The biosynthesis of Kdo2-lipid A, the active component of endotoxin, consists of nine steps in Escherichia coli (Figure 1A).1 With the exception of few Gram-negative bacteria, the rst step of lipid A biosynthesis catalyzed by LpxA is thermodynamically unfavorable and reversible.2 Therefore, the second reaction catalyzed by LpxC is generally considered the committed step of lipid A biosynthesis. Since inhibition of LpxC is bactericidal for most Gram-negative bacteria and since LpxC has never been exploited by existing antibiotics, it has become one of the most attractive novel antibiotic targets for treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.3 Consequently, signicant eorts have been devoted to developing eective LpxC-targeting antibiotics by pharmaceutical companies and academic laboratories, and potent LpxC inhibitors with distinct chemical scaolds have emerged in the last two decades (Figure 1B) (earlier compounds reviewed by refs 3 and 4 and newer inhibitors described in refs 59).  Small molecule LpxC inhibitors were initially discovered in the late 1990s using random compound screenings that coli cells.10 Lead measured 3H-galactose uptake in E. optimization led to the discovery of L-161,240, a hydrox- amate-containing phenyloxazoline compound (Figure 1B) that inhibited the growth of E. coli with potency comparable to that of ampicillin.10 Administration of L-161,240 rescued mice challenged with a lethal dose of E. coli, demonstrating its therapeutic potential. Despite the impressive antibiotic activity of L-161,240 against E. coli in vitro and in vivo, the ineectiveness of L-161,240 in controlling the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was noted early on.10 Additional experimentation has shown that the dierential antibiotic activities of L-161,240 toward E. coli and P. aeruginosa are due to the greater binding anity of L-161,240 toward E. coli LpxC (EcLpxC) than toward P. aeruginosa LpxC (PaLpxC) but not due to dierences in intrinsic resistance mechanisms of these two bacterial strains, such as membrane permeability or eux.11 A similar result was observed for the sulfonamidehydroxamate compound BB-78485 containing two naphthalene rings (Figure 1B).12 BB-78485 prevented E. coli growth with an antibiotic activity slightly better than that of L-161,240, but it is still ineective against P. aeruginosa.

(B) Comparison of the EcLpxC/L-161,240 structure with EcLpxC/LPC-009. The EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex has an unstructured C-terminal tail, whereas the C-terminus of the EcLpxC/ LPC-009 complex folds into the gap between domains I and II. Insert I, Insert II, and the C-terminus (residues 288300, modeled) are highlighted in orange, blue, and red, respectively. Inhibitors are shown with a stick model, and the active site zinc ion is shown with a space-lling model.   Recent medicinal chemistry eorts have led to the discovery of more potent LpxC-targeting antibiotics that are also eective for a wide range of Gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa.5,6,9,1315 In parallel, structural studies of LpxC and its inhibitor-bound complexes have started to unveil the architecture of this essential enzyme and the molecular basis of compound selectivity.5,1523 Notably, structural elucidation of dierent LpxC orthologs in complex with the same revealed large, diacetylene-based inhibitor LPC-009 has inherent conformational dierences of the hydrophobic, substrate-binding passage encompassed by Insert II of dierent LpxC orthologs, which plays a predominant role in accommodating the hydrophobic tail of LpxC-targeting antibiotics and in determining their activity proles.22  In contrast to many structurally characterized LpxC inhibitors containing a rigid hydrophobic tail inserted into the hydrophobic substrate-binding passage, L-161,240 has a exible propyl chain and two methoxy groups attached to a phenyloxazoline moiety. Although previous NMR studies have shown that the propyl chain of L-161,240 similarly inserts into the hydrophobic passage as other LpxC-targeting antibiotics,19 the exible propyl chain of L-161,240 is unlikely to be aected by conformational variation of the substrate-binding passage accompanied by large changes of the Insert II helix orientation in distinct LpxC orthologs, suggesting that the molecular determinant rendering EcLpxC exquisitely sensitive to the inhibition of L-161,240 arises from structural features other than the Insert II region of EcLpxC.  In order to understand the molecular basis underlying the promiscuous susceptibility of E. coli LpxC to a variety of LpxC inhibitors, including L-161,240 and BB-78485, we determined the structure of EcLpxC in complex with L-161,240 at 2.1  resolution. This structure, together with a 1.8  resolution structure of EcLpxC bound to BB-78485, reveals a previously unanticipated molecular determinant of the inhibitor specicity and sheds structural insights into further development of LpxC- targeting antibiotics.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of EcLpxC in complex with L-161,240. The crystal structure of EcLpxC in complex with L-161,240 was determined at 2.1  resolution using molecular replacement with the previously reported EcLpxC/LPC-009 complex structure as the search model.22 Because of disorder at the C- terminus, the last six amino acids of EcLpxC were not modeled. The EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex crystals were grown in signicantly dierent crystallization conditions from previously reported EcLpxCinhibitor crystals, and they belong to the trigonal R32 space group rather than the hexagonal P61 space group observed for other EcLpxC structures.15,22 In addition, previously reported crystals contained a single molecule in each asymmetric unit, whereas two EcLpxC/L-161,240 complexes arrange as a parallel homodimer to form the crystallographic asymmetric unit (Figure 2A). Since EcLpxC behaves as a monomer in solution, this crystallographic dimer is unrelated to its biological function.  The EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex shows a similar overall topology as previously reported Aquifex aeolicus LpxC structures.1618 EcLpxC consists of two domains with a  sandwich fold, and each domain contains a unique insert region: Insert I of Domain I and Insert II of Domain II. Interestingly, the EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex has a fully extended C-terminal tail that interacts with the neighboring protomer in the unit cell in a domain-swapped fashion (Supplemental Figure S1, Supporting Information). Such an extended tail conformation diers from other EcLpxC inhibitor structures,15,22 in which the C-terminus folds into the gap between Domains I and II (Figure 2B). Given the solution NMR observation of a exible and unprotected C- terminal tail of the EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex, which allows for its recognition and degradation by the FtsH protease,24 the domain swapped loop conformation of the C-terminal tail in the EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex likely reects a crystal packing artifact.  The molecular scaold of L-161,240 can be divided into three distinct regions: a hydroxamate group, an oxazoline ring, and a phenyl ring substituted with two methoxy groups and a propyl chain (Figure 1B). Each of these three regions exhibits unique interactions with LpxC to form a tight-binding complex. The hydroxamate headgroup of L-161,240, a primary anity determinant shared by many potent LpxC inhibitors, participates in coordination of the catalytic zinc with its two oxygen atoms (Figure 3A). The hydroxamate oxygen atoms of L-161,240 form a typical penta-coordination together with three conserved LpxC residues, H79, H238, and D242; however, the coordination geometry in the EcLpxC/L- 161,240 complex is vastly dierent from other LpxC/ hydroxamate inhibitor complexes, which coordinate the catalytic zinc with an approximate square-pyramidal geometry. Instead, L-161,240 chelates the catalytic zinc ion in a trigonal- bipyramidal geometry (Figure 3B), with H79, H238, and the hydroxyl oxygen of the hydroxamate group forming the central plane and with D242 and the carbonyl oxygen of the hydroxamate group forming two apical vertices. Compared with other LpxCinhibitor complexes, such as the EcLpxC/ LPC-009 complex,22 the PaLpxC/BB-78485 complex,21 and the AaLpxC/TU-514 complex,25 the plane formed by the hydroxamate atoms in the EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex rotates 25 around the hydroxamate hydroxyl oxygen. The nitrogen atom of the hydroxamate group of L-161,240 does not appear to form direct hydrogen bonds with the side chains of the catalytically important residues E78 and H265 as in other LpxC/inhibitor complexes (Figure 3A). The hydroxamate carbonyl oxygen, however, still forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of the conserved T191 side chain.     Figure 4.

(C) Isotropic temperature factor distribution in EcLpxC/BB-78485, PaLpxC/BB-78485, and PaLpxC/LPC-009. Ribbons are colored by B factor, with dark blue to red indicating low to high values, respectively.    The second region of L-161,240, the oxazoline group, is connected to the hydroxamate group by a chiral carbon. The vast majority of known LpxC inhibitors can be categorized loosely as amino acid derivatives (Figure 1B), with the substituted nitrogen group and the hydroxamate group being R1 and R2 and the C substitutions being R3 and R3. In L- 161,240, the nitrogen and alkoxy sides of the bulky cyclic moiety stem from the R1 and R3 positions of the chiral C carbon, respectively, rendering L-161, 240 as an R-enantiomer, as opposed to the S-enantiomer inhibitors, such as L-threonine- based CHIR-090 and LPC-009 containing a proton at R3 and the threonine side chain at R3 (Figure 1B). While the threonyl moiety of the S-enantiomer compounds CHIR-090 or LPC-009 forms extensive interactions with highly conserved residues on the Insert II side of the LpxC active site, the oxazoline moiety of L-161,240, due to its R-conguration at the C-position next to the hydroxamate group, tilts toward the ab loop of Insert I on the opposite side of the active site of EcLpxC, with its nitrogen atom forming a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl group of L62 to hold the oxazoline ring (Figure 3A).   Table 1. MIC Values   aLpxC replacement strain (E. coli lpxC gene replaced by P. aeruginosa lpxC gene).15 bValues for CHIR-090 and LPC-009 were adapted from refs 15 and 22.     The third moiety of L-161,240, the substituted phenyl moiety, interacts extensively with the hydrophobic substrate- binding passage. The phenyl ring is located at the mouth of the hydrophobic passage, and its propyl group inserts into the hydrophobic passage (Figure 3A,C), with the terminal methyl group of the propyl chain reaching to the close proximity of the backbone amides of G210 and S211 of the Insert II at the exit of the hydrophobic passage, a conguration consistent with prior solution NMR studies of the EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex.19 Although the penetration of the L-161,240 is shallower than that of CHIR-090 or LPC-009, the EcLpxC/L- 161,240 complex shows an equivalent opening of the external exit of the hydrophobic passage (Figure 3C). Within the active site, the phenyl ring of L-161,240 is supported by favorable van der Waals (vdW) contacts with the methyl groups of L62. Additionally, water-mediated hydrogen bonds are formed between the two methoxy groups of L-161,240 and the side chain of D197 and may serve to xate the orientation of the Insert II helix (Figure 3A).    Backbone Flipping of Insert I Residues in EcLpxC. Despite the overall structural similarity of the EcLpxC/L- 161,240 complex with other EcLpxC/inhibitor complexes, detailed structural comparison of the EcLpxC/L-161,240 and EcLpxC/LPC-009 (PDB entry 3P3G) complexes has revealed an unexpected conformational change of Insert I (Figure 3D). In particular, we note that the ab loop of Insert I in the EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex undergoes complete backbone ipping for L62 and C63 located in the loop connecting a and b strands of Insert I. As a result of such backbone ipping, the side chain of C63 rotates by almost 180 relative to its orientation in the EcLpxC/LPC-009 complex, pulling away from the hydrophobic passage to avoid a potential steric clash with the oxazoline moiety of L-161,240. In contrast, in the LPC-009 complex that contains a proton at R3 instead of a bulky substituent, the side chain of C63 ips down and points toward the hydrophobic passage of EcLpxC. Such a notable conformational change of the backbone ipping and side chain rotation in the EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex causes the ab loop to shift away from the active site by 2.0 , creating a more spacious active site cavity than that observed for the EcLpxC/LPC-009 complex to accommodate the R-stereo- specic substitution at the C position next to the hydroxamate group of L-161,240.  Having shown that the EcLpxC/LPC-009 and EcLpxC/L- 161,240 complexes have relatively minor global conformational dierences, but very distinct congurations of the ab loop of Insert I, we suspected that the ability of the ab loop of EcLpxC to adopt two distinct conformations directly underlies its extraordinary ability to accommodate a variety of diverse inhibitors, including BB-78485, which also is an R-enantiomer at the C position next to the hydroxamate group, with one naphthalene ring connected through a sulfonamide group to the R1 position of the chiral carbon and the other naphthalene ring connected to the R3 position (Figure 1B). To test this hypothesis, we additionally determined the crystal structure of the EcLpxC/BB-78485 complex, which reveals an overall similar topology for LpxC and an identical binding mode of BB- 78485 as the previously reported PaLpxC/BB-78485 struc- ture,21 with both naphthalene groups pointing toward the hydrophobic passage (Figure 4A).  Strikingly, in the EcLpxC/BB-78485 complex, we observed the same Insert I conformation found in the EcLpxC/L- 161,240 complex, where the ab loop of Insert I ips out to create a more spacious active site to accommodate BB-78485 (Figure 4B). The magnitude of the Insert I conformational rearrangement induced by BB-78485 binding is even more pronounced than that induced by L-161,240, due to the presence of the bulkier naphthalene-sulfonamide moiety. Thus, the conformational plasticity of the ab loop of Insert I of EcLpxC may be a unique structural feature that enables EcLpxC to accommodate inhibitors with divergent chemical scaolds in the active site. In support of this notion, PaLpxC appears to have a more rigid ab loop in Insert I, which does not undergo any signicant conformational change upon BB- 78485 binding, resulting in severe penalty of the binding energy. Accordingly, PaLpxC is inhibited poorly by BB-78485. Its MIC value is at least 16-fold higher against an E. coli PaLpxC knock-in strain than against WT E. coli (Table 1), indicating a similar reduction of binding anity of BB-78485 toward PaLpxC compared with EcLpxC. Additionally, binding of BB-78485 signicantly increases the isotropic temperature factor of the ab loop of Insert I in the PaLpxC/BB-78485 complex,21 whereas the corresponding region has a much smaller B-factor in the PaLpxC/LPC-009 complex22 and in the EcLpxC/BB-78485 complex (this work) (Figure 4C), suggest- ing that although the unipped Insert I conformation of PaLpxC can easily accommodate S-enantiomer compounds such as L-threonine-based LPC-009,22 such a rigid conforma- tion is far less capable of accommodating the bulky naphthalene moiety of BB-78485.

(C) Superimposition of EcLpxC/LPC-009 (orange) and EcLpxC/LPC-138 (slate). Introduction of the C-methyl group in LPC-138 results in rotation of the neighboring amide bond and the proximal phenyl ring to avoid internal steric clashes. The amide plane of LPC-138 is rotated 36 away from the corresponding plane of LPC-009 in EcLpxC.   In order to further investigate the role of the ab loop in inhibitor selectivity, we attempted to generate chimeric LpxCs in which the ab loop was swapped between EcLpxC and PaLpxC and vice versa. Unfortunately, expression of the PaLpxC chimera with the EcLpxC ab loop (58- RDTMLCTC-65) formed an inclusion body, whereas the EcLpxC chimera with the PaLpxC ab loop (58- GETTMSTT-65) is unstable in solution and does not allow for reliable measurements for inhibitor binding.  Conformational Flexibility of Insert I of E. coli LpxC Accommodates C Doubly Substituted LpxC Inhibitors. One limitation of hydromaxate compounds is their relatively high plasma clearance rates due to the metabolic turnover of the hydroxamate group through glucuronide conjugation and aldehyde oxidase-mediated metabolism.26 Substituting the hydroxamate group with the carboxylate group signicantly improves the half-life of parent compounds, but such a substitution invariably results in a complete loss of antibiotic activity of LpxC inhibitors.5,27 Another approach to suppress the metabolic turnover of the hydroxamate group is through introduction of sterically hindered functional groups (e.g., an additional methyl group) at the neighboring C position of the hydroxamate group.28 Although such substitution generates vdW clashes in our structural model of the EcLpxC/LPC-009 complex, the observation that Insert I of EcLpxC is capable of undergoing backbone ipping to generate an expanded active site to accommodate R-enantiomer compounds L-161,240 and BB-78485 suggests that with a ipped Insert I, EcLpxC may be able to tolerate inhibitors containing such modication. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a derivative of LPC-009 and LPC-011, which contains a C-methyl substituted threonyl- hydroxamate headgroup and an amino-substituted biphenyl diacetylene scaold. Indeed, such a methyl substituted compound (LPC-138) is well tolerated by EcLpxC, with a MIC value of 0.24 g/mL, which is similar to that of CHIR- 090 and slightly worse than LPC-009 and LPC-011 (58- fold; Table 1). In contrast, although CHIR-090, LPC-009, and LPC-011 display broad-spectrum antibiotic activities against a variety of Gram-negative bacteria, the C-methyl substituted compound LPC-138 has become a specic antibiotic similar to L-161,240 and BB-78485 (Table 1), and it is eective only for E. coli and closely related Gram-negative bacteria, whose LpxC enzymes share a high degree of sequence identity with EcLpxC and presumably a exible Insert I capable of conformational ipping to interact with C doubly substituted inhibitors (Table 1).     In order to verify this predicted mode of interaction of LPC- 138 with LpxC, we carried out structural analysis of EcLpxC in complex with LPC-138 (Figure 5). As expected, LPC-138 binds in the hydrophobic passage, with an overall binding mode very to that of LPC-009 reported previously.22 The similar introduction of the C-methyl substitution however causes rotation of the neighboring amide bond and the proximal phenyl ring to avoid internal steric clashes, and these changes generate a ipped Insert I conformation of EcLpxC that coexists with an unipped Insert I conformation. The coexistence of two conformations of the EcLpxC Insert I is consistent with the smaller spatial footprint of the C-methyl group and its neighboring amide group compared with the R- substituted oxazoline ring in L-161,240 and the naphthalene group of BB-78485, and such an observation reinforces the notion of conformational exibility of the Insert I loop of E. coli LpxC.   aReagents and conditions: (a) NH2OBnHCl, 1 M LiHMDS, THF, 78 C, 1 h; (b) 2 M HCl, MeOH, RT (8 h) then reux (4 h); (c) pentauorophenol, DCC, DMAP, THF, RT, 12 h; (d) NEt3, DMF, RT, 12 h; (e) 1 M BCl3, DCM, 10 C, 1 h.    Implication for Inhibitor Design. Since the discovery of L-161,240, LpxC inhibitors with a variety of chemical scaolds have been reported, each with distinct antibiotic proles. A vast majority of these compounds eciently inhibit the growth of E. coli and are selective inhibitors for EcLpxC, but not for PaLpxC. How EcLpxC binds these compounds, including compounds the C- with two distinct stereospecic congurations at position of the hydroxamate group has remained a mystery. Here, we shed light on this conundrum by determining the structures of EcLpxC in complex with L-161,240, BB-78485, and a newly designed compound LPC-138. Together, these structures reveal the conformational exibility of the Insert I loop of EcLpxC as the molecular basis underlying the extraordinary susceptibility of EcLpxC to diverse inhibitors. While LpxC orthologs with a rigid Insert I region are only capable of interacting with S-enantiomer inhibitors such as CHIR-090, LpxC orthologs with a exible Insert I region, represented by EcLpxC, are able to alter the size and the shape of the active site in response to inhibitor binding by adopting dierent conformations of Insert I. Such conformational exibility allows EcLpxC to accommodate a variety of LpxC inhibitors with distinct scaolds, including compounds that contain R-substituted bulky moieties at the C-position next to the hydroxamate group and compounds with double substitutions at the C position.    Our study suggests that the successful design of broad- spectrum LpxC inhibitors will require navigating dierences in conformations and exibilities of distinct LpxC orthologs. The previously reported diacetylene-based inhibitor LPC-009 is an excellent example of a compound whose elastic scaold allows it to overcome structural variations in the Insert II hydrophobic passage of distinct LpxC orthologs and is essential for its broad- spectrum antibiotic activity.22 In this study, we reveal another key motif, the ab loop of Insert I, that confers resistance to suggesting that more exible L-161,240 and BB-78485, inhibitors would be necessary to overcome the conformational heterogeneity of both Insert I and Insert II of LpxC. Conversely, subtle changes of broad-spectrum inhibitors such as LPC-009 and LPC-011 that exploit the unique conforma- tional plasticity of the ab loop in EcLpxC and closely related orthologs can provide a strategy to design highly potent inhibitors for use against a specic set of Gram-negative pathogens, such as Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Vibrio, and Klebsiella.    Another important insight of this work is the trigonal- bipyramidal geometry of the catalytic zinc coordination in the EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex. Because square pyramidal geom- etry has been observed for all other hydroxamate-containing inhibitors, this zinc coordination state has generally been regarded as a primary restraint for structure-based design of LpxC inhibitors. However, it is well-known that many zinc- dependent enzymes utilize the Berry pseudorotation process, the isomerization between two penta-coordination geometries, for transition-state stabilization in catalysis. Thus, our observation of a trigonal-bipyramidal zinc coordination may provide important insights into LpxC catalysis and new metal constraints for computational design of novel inhibitors. Furthermore, this alternative zinc coordination may aect the overall position of an inhibitor in the active site and enable the incorporation of new scaolds into LpxC-targeting antibiotics.

METHODS  Chemical Synthesis. CHIR-090, BB-78485, L-161,240, LPC-009, and LPC-011 were synthesized as described.12,13,15,29 Synthesis of LPC-138 (Scheme 1) commenced from methyl (2R,3S,7R,7aS)-7- methoxy-2,3,7,7a-tetramethyl-5-oxotetrahydro-2H-oxazolo[4,3-b]- oxazole-3-carboxylate (1), which was generated as reported.30 Treatment of the bicyclic derivative 1 with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of LiHMDS provided benzyl protected hydroxamate 231 in 81% yield. Acidic hydrolysis of the substrate 2 aorded amino acid hydroxamate 3 in 55% yield. Reaction of the amino acid derivative 3 with pentauorophenyl (PFP) ester 5, which was prepared from corresponding carboxylic acid 4,15 provided amide 6 in 81% yield. Upon subsequent deprotection of the benzyl group in the substrate 6, using BCl3, the nal compound LPC-138 was obtained in 56% yield.  Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection. Protein samples were prepared as described previously.15,22 For the L-161,240 complex, puried EcLpxC was diluted to a nal concentration of 6 mg mL1, and a 4-fold molar excess of L-161,240 dissolved in DMSO was added to the diluted protein. The protein and inhibitor were incubated on ice for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous sample before setting up crystallization screening. EcLpxC/L-161,240 complex crystals were produced with the sitting drop vapor diusion method at 4 C, in drops containing 2 L of the EcLpxC/L-161,240 mixture and 1 L of well solution consisting of 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate, pH 5.6, 20% 2-propanol, 20% w/v PEG 4000, and 10 mM DTT. Diraction data were collected at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-BM beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory.  For the BB-78485 complex, EcLpxC protein was diluted to a nal concentration of 10 mg mL1, mixed with 4-fold molar excess of BB- 78485 dissolved in DMSO, and incubated on ice for 1 h. The complex crystals were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diusion method at 4 C, with a reservoir solution containing 3.6 M sodium formate (Hampton Research), 10% glycerol, and 10 mM DTT. Two microliters of the complex sample was mixed with an equal amount of reservoir solution prior to equilibration. Diraction data were collected in-house at 100 K using a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF rotating anode generator and R-Axis IV++ detector.  For the LPC-138 complex, initial screening failed to yield any crystals. After reviewing the previously published crystallization structure of the EcLpxC/LPC-009,22 we were able to identify an impurity molecule that contains a threonyl-hydroxamate group coupled to a phenyl-acetylene group (4-ethynyl-N-((2S,3R)-3- hydroxy-1-(hydroxyamino)-1-oxobutan-2-yl)benzamide) lying at the interface of two EcLpxC molecules. Such a compound does not bind EcLpxC with an appreciable anity based on ITC studies (data now shown). Inclusion of such a molecule (1.2 mM) similarly stabilizes the crystal packing of the EcLpxC/LPC-138 complex, and we were able to obtain diraction quality crystals by mixing 10 mg mL1 protein solution with a 4-fold molar excess of LPC-138 dissolved in DMSO. The EcLpxC/LPC-138 crystals were obtained with the sitting drop vapor diusion method at 4 C, in drops containing 1.2 L of the complex sample and 0.9 L of well solution consisting of 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.7 M lithium sulfate, and 16 mM DTT. The crystals were cryoprotected with peruoropolyether (PFO-X175/08) before ash-freezing. Data set of the EcLpxC/LPC-138 complex cocrystal was collected at the SER-CAT 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. All the X-ray diraction data were processed with HKL2000.32  Model Building and Renement. Molecular replacement with the program PHASER33 was used to obtain initial phases for LpxC- inhibitor structures using the EcLpxC/LPC-009 complex (PDB entry 3P3E) as the search model. Water molecules were added using PHENIX and veried with COOT.34,35 An additional molecule (ligand or additive) was found at the packing interface of EcLpxC molecules in the EcLpxC/BB-78485 complex and in the EcLpxC/LPC-138 complex, which likely stabilizes the crystal packing of the complex. The statistics for these structures are shown in Table 2.  MIC Tests. MIC tests were carried out as described previously using a modied NCCLS protocol, which is adapted to 96-well plates and LB media in the presence of 5% DMSO.22,36 Briey, 100 L of various concentrations of compounds were prepared on a standard 96- well plate (Corning Costar 3596, at bottomed with lid, polystyrene wells), in 2-fold dilution series with a range of 0.0005 to 100 g/mL. Bacterial cells, grown to OD600 = 0.6, were diluted 1:100 into LB medium, and 100 L of the diluted cells was added into each well and incubated at 37 C for 22 h. After the incubation, 50 L of 1 mg mL1 [4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (MTT) was added and incubated at 37 C for another 3 h. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that prevented color change (yellow to black).
